Death Of Ferdia
On this bloodstained land
I will make my stand
And my honour will defend
Ferdia oh, my friend
This will be the end
When this spear will leave my hand
Fight with me!
Choose your weapon today!
Let it be all or any, today you're both brother and prey
Draw your sword!
Cast your spear to me!
Ferdia! Come face your brother
Come face the Hound of Cullan!
I care not whether I die
tomorrow or next year
If my deeds live after me
My soul dies here with you
Brother, see you
In Tir nan nOg
My spear pierces your heart, and strikes mine twice as hard
Today, there will be no victory
Yet again, my brother
My hands are covered in your blood
This time not heal your wounds
Fate wanted us to live as brothers
And die as foes
Woe onto ireann, for the greatest of warriors has fallen
Gergovia
7 times a hundred roman souls
46 centurions slain on Gergovia's hill
700 skulls to celebrate the gods
As they bless the name of Vercingetorix
The eagle spreading his wings
Has darkened our sun
Our forage destroyed
Our crop is watered in blood
Legions invincible march of Gaul
One by one tribes are paying the toll
I heard of a hero who would stop all of this
And reign over Gaul as a king
I heard of a man who will triumph over Rome
Vercingetorix
Caesar entrenched camp outside their fort
And captured a high hill from where he laid siege
Centurions advanced
To ensure the Gauls have surrendered
Legions invincible launch the attack
One by one tribes pay the toll
Oblivious of what's hidden within the walls
Gergovia the glorious had a new king
Hailing their leader the Gauls shouted loud: Vercingetorix
Caesar roared as the legions charged
Ordering to retreat - recedite!!
Blinded by blood thirst his army attacked
and ignored his command
Crying for victory marching to death
Hailing "Caesar, Caesar!" to their last breath
Days Of High Adventure
Sword at side or pen to write
Our weapon in our heart more than in our hand
To fall in the line or stand back to sing
We witnessed the glory of many heroes' end
We've marched aside the greatest of all
Whoever that is only the soul can tell
We sang for those who could never rest
The Days of High Adventure
In our chests, will never end
Aeons long gone and places unseen...
Our life is lost between what will be and what has been
Commanding a fleet or sounding a charge
Our souls will fill with ecstasy when we draw our swords
We'll never forget when we reigned on Aquilonia
Or fought aside the Albino Prince
Wear the Ring, Ride the Dragon, draw the Sword out of the Stone
And blow your last breath into the Horn!
We've always been there
We are the Riders of Doom
One fate: Sword and Shield
In Days of High Adventure
We are born to die on the battlefield
Steel Of My Axe
Horns in the distance, resound through the air
The trebuchet's shape standst tall
Attack is imminent, but I have no fear
I won't be dethroned
As in 1282, when flames reached the sky,
I am ready again to swing my axe
And sound the horn to charge the besiegers
The hunters are hunted again
I am born a king and will die a king
The blade of my axe is my witness
The deceivers' blood paved my way to the throne
Now I am here to stay!
God's fire of hate and destruction is here to kill, But I shall triumph once again by the steel of my axe!
I sharpened my blade for all these years
Waiting to take my revenge
The heads of those who tried to dethrone me
Will taste the cold steel, and then roll
I took my path, my decisions are made
I now cheer with blood in my horn
I reign my kingdom, your only choice to obey
Speak to my axe then to me
I am born a king and will die a king
The blade of my axe is my witness
Deceivers' blood paves my way to the throne
I am here to stay!
God's fire of hate and destruction is here to ki
I shall triumph once again by the steel of my axe!
I hail this land, my kingdom again
No mercy for the deceivers
Axe at my side, my reign is of steel
As of steel is my pride
Claidheamh Solais (Sword Of Light)
Through the tales
The legend lived
A Sword of Salvation
At the side of
The greatest kings
Brought Hope and Destruction
A light that shone
Of ancient strength,
Arose from the Earth
From green misty hills
To swing in frostbitten lands
Forged by the Gods
The Sword that was made for Man
Caladvwlch, bring us all to Victory!
Blade of Doom, ruler of Man's Destiny!
I chant your countless names:
Sword of Light, Sword of Doom
Caladcholg
The rainbow beam
Connacht's Defender
Caliburn
Cymric Heir
Of the best of ?ireann
A golden hilt
For a silver hand
Who ruled the first reign
Crusher of Evil
Its power will one day return
When the white lord is vanquished
The fire of our faith will burn
Caladvwlch, bring us all to victory!
Blae of Doom, ruler of Man's Destiny!
I chant your countless names:
Sword of Light, Sword of Doom
Thundercult
Upon this twisted land
And consecrated by the Gods' touch
I shall create the cult of myself
Where the sky and earth and divine fire
are one
I shall create my Thundercult
May the sensation of the Thunder
Descend onto me
I am thunder, I am divine
I am the Thundercult
May the thunder be in my hand
In my chest and my voice
May I be a living Thundercult
May the sensation of the thunder
Descend onto me
I am thunder, I am divine
I am the thundercult
This way the sentence from above
Shall manifest itself
Thus the cult was consecrated
The Throne of Thunder is mine
Luni
Head toward the island
On its shores we saw a cross
Priests of the new white god
Who want to replace our pagan faith
Approach to a silent land,
On which holy chants resound
Give them a dreadful lesson
The Raven flies over the Dove
May I die in Odin's name, the monks shall be tortured and slain
This is now land of the greatest of all
May I kill in Odin's name
No crosses and churches shall stand against our sky
Guide me Odin,
Guide me, I'll leave this land burning for you
Guide the faithful to the end.
Lay me on a board,
Bring me to the priest
Let me enter the temple
Of the White Lord of the Heavens
Let me avenge my faters
By holding this priest's head
Go forth now my warriors
And burn this town to the ground
May I die in Odin's name, the monks shall be tortured and slain
This is now land of the greatest of all
May I kill in Odin's name
No crosses and churches shall stand against our sky
Guide me Odin,
Guide me, I'll leave this land burning for you
Guide the faithful to the end
Once Glorious
At the feet of the mountains
On this hills of ancient pride
I lay my eyes on the endless lake
And still I can hear the stories that it spake...
Of a folk that tried its steel
And found death on the battlefield
Once glorious! Once mine!
These hills are no longer alive
With the spirit of this valiant Tribe
Wirdomar made the final stand
The wolf breastfed descendants
save by crying geese
thereafter shadowed this wooden land
Our valleys witnessed no kings since
the day Lugh hid in the lakes
Once glorious! Once mine!
These hills are no longer alive
With the spirit of this valiant Tribe
The Great Horn
From my infinite journey I, at last, return
To my native lands, of the ancient gods of old
Under a boulder I found the legendary great horn
The moment is here to fight for the harp of gold
Warriors
From all of the nation come to answer the call
Warriors
The moment of truth is here, the nation calls
Its magical power I will release onto the land
And summon the army at my father's command
Foes as black as bog oak and brown as wet sand
The nation arises once again, a proud last stand
Warriors
From all of the nation come to answer the call
Warriors
The moment of truth is here, the nation calls
And what I thought was destined to remain a memory
Before my eyes became splendid truth
All the heroes of the tales of old are now gathered
By the sound of the Great Horn

DOOMSWORD LYRICS
Shores Of Vinland
We were sailing towards
The unknown in the open sea
After the storm, our hope was lost
In the raging waves but
My old faith was never so strong,
My viking heart don't fear the fate!
Under Leif's christian command
Full of wild grapes was the land
To which we approached
And tried to live but no more
Hydromel was in our horns
Our viking hearts don't fear the fate!
Twice a winter, we messed our beloved.
Praying the lord,
Leif sought a blessing for our souls
Under his sign we abandoned our folks,
Now we are ready to unfurl the sails
Naglfar the ship will not have our nails,
Our viking hearts don't fear the fate!
Twice a winter we missed our beloved,
To these shores our hearts do not belong!
Our ship devours the ocean waste
The sea is the nature on which we where born
Approaching our bay resound the viking horn
The hammer triumphant,
The cross now is torn,
My viking heart still has faith!
Twice a winter, we missed our beloved
Who did enlight the way to return?
Mighty Thor bring me back home.
Onward Into Battle (On The March Again)
We chose our destiny
Fianna is the name
For which we shall live
To which our souls we give
Once again to the battle we march
Blow after blow
Swords spreading death
Witness your glory or
Your mates' last breath.
March! March!
We answer the call of the king,
From far you can hear
The army that sings
"Victory we bring!"
Lamp fires await for the dawn,
Coward would me the attack
Glory awaits when the sun
Shines bright.
March! March!
On the march
On the march again
On the march,
On the march!
The Doomsword
He walks among strangers' eyes
Hearse of his unknown presence,
The world is still confused
And the balance was changed
By the DoomSword
The dark shape will rise,
A demon at side
The DoomSword will fall
On the world
The bell of fate sounds its toll,
The DoomSword.
For the whole world will fear
The sign and the name of the lord
Who bears the DoomSword!
Resign to the blade
Which in hell was made
Your soul is safe no more
It can't be your choice:
"Bow to the sword!"
Listen to the doom
And knell to the sword,
The blade rose tall it's now ruler,
Ruler of all for the whole world will fear
The sign and the name of the lord
Who bears the DoomSword.
For I am your god and you must obey,
I am the king, war I will bring,
Follow me or be my pray,
Be my pray!
MCMXIX
If you look to the east,
On the ways of pilgrimage,
You can still see the trails,
Which they left behind.
Deserted sands on the slopes
Of what once where hills,
Hide a mystic mystery,
The quest for the holy research.
Nine knights for none years
Piercing the ground they all disappeared,
A secret plot disguised as holy quest,
Nine knights did want to disappear.
As above so below of the temple
Was the law, see the stars that shine
Upon dark shapes behind the cross
What was found has now been lost
Arcane knowledge they obtained
What they finally left be
Kind is what chosen few can see.
Nine knights for none years piercing
The ground they all disappeared
A secret plot disguised as holy quest,
Nine knights did want to disappear,
Nine knights, one might!
For Those Who Died With Sword In Hand
I look to my land this one,
The last time should be a desperate deed
I will mire my blood with sand,
The steel is now in me this cold blade
That gives me death
And all I see is the blood
From my wounds,
Blinding me,
The death which I will have
Should grant me the glory I sought
For my breed shall proclaim
How glorious was their elder one,
This is my end
I proudly mix my blood with sand...
No! Do not crave for those
Who died with sword in hand,
I look to my land this one,
The last time should be a desperatate deed
I will mix my blood with sand
My battle ends here
Every one witnessed I had no fear
With honour I fought
Don't cry for those who died this way,
The death which I will have
Should grant me the glory I sought
For my breed shall proclaim
How glorious was their elder one,
This is my end
I proudly mix my blood with sand,
No! Do not crave for those
Who died with sword in hand.
The Youth Of Finn Mac Cool
We were roaming through the Black head
Hungry and tired looking for food,
When we saw an old and thin deer
And we dreamt cooked flesh with beer,
We held in tight in our hand the spear,
Like the mind it fled with its fear.
Nine warriors were at my side,
Everyone incarnation of pride
Together with my two hounds for that day,
Still no food we had found,
With our usual defiance
The hunt carried on for more preys
Thirsty spears shone.
Warrior and bard poetry
Runs through your heart
Enchant and dazes you
Lower your blade.
On our path we boldly walked forth
When a red braded deer
From the north swiftly stood
Before eager eyes,
To attack we all mobilized,
But even the hounds stood still at my cry:
"Leave that deer for he should die!"
Baffled eyes turned towards me
All admired my pure ecstasy,
With calm I sang my poetry
For its beauty my will should let be,
With my words all hearts were bestowed,
Poetry's power I mystically showed.
Resound The Horn: Odin's Hail
A black host descends
Omen of the end
Fury and pride at Odin's command
Just the mountains can dare to stand,
Hordes of the gods
Almighty force
Foreign invader surely won't prevail
The army that cried loud Odin's hail.
It doesn't matter how much
I shall suffer to live
To condign my poor soul
In your mighty hands
I long for that moment my life
I shall give and if I die in this battle...
Let hammer commence!
Black mist now protect us
From unfaithful eyes,
The attack to the cross
And its god will surely succeed,
Steel at my side, banners up high,
Ancient words from the Gods
I pronounce the Viking war-cry:
Odin's hail, it doesn't matter how
Much I shall suffer to live
To condign my poor soul
In your mighty hands
I long for the moment my life
I shall give and if I die in this battle...
Let Battle commence!
This is the dan for which I was born,
I blow my last breath into the horn,
To the halls of Valhalla
I know finally
My last words are
Odin's hail!
Sacred Metal
I'm coming on the wind
to tell the story on two men
in the hands of a foreign king
they have been forced to sing
Listen to the wind it tells the story
of these men who fought
chosen by the fate to bring
the signs of their king high
searching for new places to fight
in the name of glory
they've been waiting for a long time
to wield their swords of doom
the gods have chosen them
to show the greatness of their faith
tied tortured and beaten
chosen to be proved or killed
but even in those days
they're not afraid to die because of
Warbringers
Blasphemous chants against the gods
threw us in the abyss of a curse
1000 thousand days of war and scorn
will make us repent to be born
no hope to flee from this jail
but we can't die we shall not fail
Our fate is written swords and shield
born to die on the battlefield
the curse has been cast
no place to hide or flee
we were named WarBringers.
Now I remember ungraceful days
taken as prisoners by the enemies
Under the fortress walls we will march
Our banners high again!
"...then we took refuge in the woods
with strange visions in our minds
a great plan covered by enemies' heads
until that moment I can't be dead."
Helms Deep
Goblinoid forces attack the fortress
aiming the tower with their evil missiles
Isengard banners and signs now shine
night is growing old on Helm's deep
Guthwine the blade of the mighty Eomer
Anduril the blade once broken now strong
King Theoden awaits for a last ride on his horse
Imminent dawn carries hope on Helm's deep
Will the horn resound?
Hear tremendous drums pound!
The battle at Helm's deep
Uruk-hai orks don't know their fate
Gandalf now returns on his gray horse
White rider brings with him the hope
The battle is raging in Helm's deep
Erkenbrand is coming with his red shield
Isengard's army now trembles in fear
From hills resound the horns of doom
A wood never seen
On the tresholds of Helm's deep
Resound the horn!
One Eyed God
 The lost eye for wisdom reads the runes
on which our fiery people writes his doom
 Devotion proudly sails in the lake of blood
Drunk by the ground of the young and the old
 Your allseeing eye is hight for men and gods
For whom wait the age of dark Ragnarok
 But so many enemies will taste the hammer
Of the viking hearts fiery banner
In battle my fate I'll show
it's a rite long time known
For I am your son
the wind brings my song
and you are of ravens the Lord
One Eyed God Ravenlord
Death, mist and cold plague the Niflhel
Naglfar the ship, made of nails of the dead
Sails silent and relentless, straight to that hell
There who didn't die in battle suffering will dwell
But to Asgard and Valhalla our fate is led
Because out immotrality won't serve its queen Hel
But in the higher Asgard we will kindly stand
and with strength and glory
Return To Imrryr
Yrkoon the traitor sits on the throne
Elric is back now
to show how much his hate has grown
His thirst for vegeance
now brings no name his cousin must ruin
covered by shame
Elric the White Wolf and his black sword
this diabolic couple has no rivals on th world
Stormbringer is called his infernal blade
powers unknown in hellish flames made
Dragon with the black sword!Elric!
His powerful ships to Imrryr now sail
(with) the lords of the sea
he's sure he will prevail
From his voyage returns
the bearer of the Sword
protected by Arioch and his infernal horde
"Cymoril beloved, I'll set you free
Yrkoon must die no dawns he will see"
The dragon's empire a 10000 years reign
Collapses like the towers stones fall like rain!
Nadsokor
Swords Of Doom
We're the ones
we're the ones
the chosen to wield the swords of doom
we've got to fight to free from the curse
that made us the bringers
of scorn and war
"In countless battles I'll have to fight
'till my sacred blade will shine bright
this holy sword will guide my heart
and only death can do us apart"
"Fight, my warrior,fight
Show the gods your might"
Swords of Doom
On The March
A procession of soldiers march
through the woods
vegeance is waiting to become true
the enemy's castle is there on the hill
a monument to our victory
through time will stand still
on the march!
Death is awaiting
our final day is come
praying the gods we are ready to die
make them hear our loud battle cry
battle is raging dead bodies everywhere
boiling oil and arrows
tear down the castle walls
five days under siege before our triumph
now another battle awaits
another march for life
