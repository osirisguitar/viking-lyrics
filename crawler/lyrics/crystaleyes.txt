Vengeance Descending
I've found a way back to my home at last
A way that has been locked and cloaked until now
It's time to take care of my programmed past,
find the answers, and then finally fulfil my vow
I've learned from my ship's secret files
that they planned my unwanted exile!
I knew too much about their insane plan
I had to leave, from the Earth I was banned
For years I have travelled in the dark and endless space,
cast out from the human race
For vengeance I'm yearning now as I'm returning
to make my wrongdoers pay for my lonely days
Revenge!
Imperfect data I got from below,
but I've learned enough from my unknown friend
They sent me away so their empire could grow
On Terra my vengeance shall descend
I'm burning of hatred and rage,
for their lies and my time lost in space
I'll end the Interstellar War,
and disclose their plans of the human race
Revenge will be mine!
Highland Revenge
A wind of hatred is blowing across the field
I am the voice of the Clans
The leader of the Highlands
and we have come here for blood and victory
Before my army I speak the great words of war...
Brothers, they may take our lives
but they'll never take away our freedom
Scotland! I hear you call my name,
now as we ride towards our aim
England! I damn you as I cry...
Pay for the blood on the Highlands and die!
You took my father's life
You raped and killed my wife
In God's name I swear I'll get my revenge
The great rebellion I bring
will slay you and your foul king
I am the legend, the brave, the proud, your fate
The last words are spoken, now hear them roar in the wind...
Brothers, they may take our lives
but they'll never take away our freedom
We may loose the battle 
We may loose some men
But still we have showed the world
that no one can take away our freedom
Child Of Rock
A little child has changed our world
A light in the dark, a miracle
Forevermore her spirit will illuminate our lives
With open arms and open minds
we make her one of our kind
In unity we now welcome her with our song
Spread your wings and fly, we will take you high
Child of Rock
You were born and bound to the Heavy sound
Child of Rock
Trust us when we say... Take the Metal way!
Life is too short to throw away
Don't waste no time, live here and today
There may be tears along the way, but we'll be here for you
There is no right, there is no wrong
What you will need is in our song
The Only Rule is all for one and one for all
When we're dead and gone
you'll have to carry on
Show them that you're strong
and always remember our song
Oh, oh, child you were born to rock
Oh, oh, child you were born to rock
Oh, oh, child you were born to rock
Oh, oh, child you were born to rock
We were all born to rock!
Mr. Failure
You think you're Messiah supreme,
'cause you write in a magazine
But what's coming out of your head
makes me wonder if your brain is dead
You think everyone is a star
just because they got a guitar
Our music is not made for you,
'cause 'bout Metal you don't have a clue
You live your life just to criticize,
and sneak around to spread your lies
Among the fools from the MTV
you create a false reality
Hey Mr. Failure, face it
We don't wanna read your bullshit
Your words are fake, we want 'em no more
You're a wannabe to the core
Hey Mr. Failure, silence
Because what you say is nonsense
Now take this as a rule
you damn pathetic fool
Oh Mr. Failure, you can't see what it's about
We've had enough, get out!
and leave our ground once and for all
You're greasing the media machine,
with vicious rumours of our scene
You bring our band to your mill,
and you grind us just for the thrill
The sick brain of yours never rest,
always plan for what you do best...
Oppress, provoke, irritate,
ridicule, humiliate
You say you do not like our sound,
but we do not care, just leave our ground
Heavy Metal is what we play
no matter what you say
Now hear our song and obey
Dream Chaser
Across a hot and desert land
Against the wind of dust and sand
Reality seems so far away
Under the burning mortal sun
I find myself, the lonely one
A stranger rushing blindly through the day
Burning Horizon you are calling me
Burning Horizon you will set me free
Once a hero, now a shade
Chasing dreams that slowly fade
On the endless road to nowhere I ride
Once a proud man, now a ghost
In search of peace from coast to coast
From my dark and empty life I can not hide
Don't know how many years have past,
or how long this journey will last
Tomorrow seems so far far away
I am a madman on the run
Yes, a lost forgotten son
All I know's that I can not stay
Memories of pain hunt me everyday
They're driving me insane.
I can't find a way out of this hell
Someone please tell. Why did it all go wrong?
And tell me where, just where do I belong?
Let me find a place to stay
The Wizard's Apprentice
The look of disbelief is still in your face
as I watch how your eyes begin to glaze
Your broken body lies in a growing pool
of blood... I have betrayed you, you sorry old fool
But to have your Art makes it worth this crime,
and your former knowledge will soon be mine
In my hands I now hold your Grand Grimoire,
the source of your once great might and arcane lore
How many times have I not cursed these pages?
It feels like I've been reading for ages
But I can not give up, I have to be patient
'cause your book contains the Art of the Ancient
Soon your magic will lie in my hands
Every spell, powerful and grand,
of the greatest Art are going to be known to me
And then, my friend, I will no longer be...
the wizard's apprentice
I have found the key. How could I be so blind?
With the right phrase and the right state of mind
the power explodes in me, burning deep inside
The Art engulfs me in a roaring magic tide
For how many years have I not yearned and craved for this?
It feels like I have reached eternal bliss
And it does not matter much that my soul is stained
by your death, compared to what I have gained
Now your magic lies in my hands
Every spell, powerful and grand,
of the greatest Art are now finally known to me
And no more, my friend, will I ever be...
the wizard's apprentice
I am divine, pure energy
The Ancient's power flows in me
But it's to much for my mind to sustain
With a sudden burst of pain
all magic's scorched from my brain,
and I realise that all have been in vain
My Art is forever gone!
Solo Nyberg, Dahl
So now my magic's no more
My Art is gone, my precious lore
has forever been burned away from my very core
And now I am neither the Master Mage nor
the wizard's apprentice
Just a common man

The Beast In Velvet
It's the birthday of the Emperor
The cream of the realm is here,
kings and queens with sons and daughters
It's truly a most grandiose ball,
nobles fill the halls
Like sheep, ready for slaughter
Oh, with rising hate I watch them dance,
I watch them prance
Oh, how I loathe these haughty swine
I'll rid the world of this living grime
Peasants are saying, oh not without glee,
there's an aristocrat out on a killing spree
A noble, thirsty for royal blood they say
The Beast in Velvet I'm called by my prey
Though my fee is great indeed
I'd do this for free,
'cause I enjoy my work immensely
With wit and grace I charm these fools
who think they're out of harm's way
None here's aware of my sins
But then again, who'd suspect a highborn prince?
It's been so easy to lure my prey,
so to my Lord I gratefully pray
as my victim dies by my blade
Shape shifting is a useful trick in my dark trade
Heart Of The Mountain
There's a mountain by the northern sea
High and mighty like an endless tower
A tempting and majestic sight
with a treacherous secret
There's a legend 'bout its mystery
and it speaks about a tremendous power
A creation of the Gods
and a gate to Heaven
At night you see the light that will invite
the fearless to the summit
Climb and you will find yourself behind
the walls of ancient stone
Lost souls in the mountain's grave
Not dead or alive, just forgotten
Trapped in the adventurers' cave
All condemned to languish in darkness,
silence and madness
Forever paying the price
in the heart of the mountain
In a dream you saw the land of gold,
as the mountain tempted in a vision
Where the angels spread their wings
there's where you'll find your freedom
To the glorious dream your soul was sold
To find the house of God became your mission
So you left your past behind,
and now you're heading for the sky
By the light at the summit
you are turned to stone
Oblivion In The Visionary World
When darkness enters my life, 
that's when you arise
Slowly crawling into my mind
from the other side
In a callous realm, I'm captured,
completely paralysed
Through your eyes I see the real world,
where love and hate have died
I'm terrified, but somehow I have always known
We are nothing but wandering spirits in an endless void
On the edge of time I face my destiny,
and find myself within a false reality
Was my life a lie inside an evil whirl?
Oblivion reign within the Visionary World,
forever
Lifeless, impassive and alone
Dreaming a dream that's not my own
Am I alive or dead?
When did they conquer our kind?
Why did they take control of our minds?
My past is erased and gone
I'm lost in a cage
Created in the age of silence and illusions
Ride The Rainbow
Beneath the blackened sky
when the diamonds glow
you taste the moonlight in solitude
Far away from life's eternal decay
The wheel of time aches in your restless heart
The haunting inner voice of freedom won't let you go
Long years of torment and never left alone
You seek a place where the cold winds don't blow
In your own sanctuary from life. Yes!
Strangers and lies fade in your mind
On the edge of midnight
Ride the rainbow. Aim for the sky
Tame the starlight and you will fly
Ride the rainbow. Let your kingdom come
Claim the night. You're the chosen one
Ride the rainbow. Ride forever
Find the gate to your dreams. Ride the rainbow
So pure and innocent
in your bleeding eyes
The perfect darkness relieve the pain
Yet the wounds of war and violence remain
Respect and orders, a never ending tale
You seek a haven from duties and chains
Aaaah - Take my words and find your kingdom
Aaaah - Take my words and find your kingdom
Aaaah
Aaaah - Take my words and find your kingdom now!
The Fire Of Hades
Long ago I saw tomorrow drift away
like a whirlwind on the ocean
Left alone to walk the island of decay
like a blind man led to nowhere
I let it go, I let it go
After all I've found a way
from the hammer of the Gods
to the power of the dark
And the road goes on and on
I'm coming for the fire of Hades
My eternal paradise
I'm coming for the fire of Hades
Where the tempter calls my name
I surrender my soul as a final sacrifice
Over mountains roar the sound of yesterday
like a last cry of the mourner
Round and round inside the broken wheel of pain
with no light or destination
I'm coming home sailing on the last rays of the sun
I'm coming home from the empty world beyond
Hear me now I'm coming home
on the wind of silence to the flames
And the road goes on and on
And the road goes on and on and on
The Devil Inside
Are you ready?
Welcome the night. Put your worries away
Leave the sirens for a while
Enter the quiet and mysterious place
Let the silence roll the dice
A shadow never lies
We stand on the edge of the world
The gate is open wide
And out of the dark he crawls
right into your mind
Don't wait for the devil tonight
You're a midnight dreamer
Don't wait for the devil tonight
You're a midnight dreamer
The devil inside
Into the eyes of the fire he breathes
Like a whisper of your fate
Ready to strike on the hour of dreams
when the light has gone away
Don't wait for the devil tonight
You're a midnight dreamer
Don't wait for the devil tonight
You're a midnight dreamer
Don't wait for the devil tonight
You're a midnight dreamer
Don't wait for the devil
Don't wait - Don't wait for the devil
You are the devil inside
Waves Of War
On the waves of war
Far away from mortal eyes
The sign of Jolly Roger flies over the undead
Fire and water on the horizon
Is there a world beyond the sea?
We all remember the ground of the island
where we paid the price of our greed
Watching the sun fading from our eyes
When will the wind take us home?
On the waves of war
ride her ghost into the night
Condemned to carry on forever
On the waves of war
Far away from mortal eyes
The sign of Jolly Roger flies over the undead
Over the ocean like an illusion
Travel the world for land in sight
Sadly the bones shine under the moonlight
of those neither dead nor alive
Day after day trying to lift the curse
Restore the gold and pay the blood
No stormy weather in the eyes of the lost
The shadow of tomorrow is so dark
No stormy weather in the eyes of the lost
The journey onto freedom and the quest for life
control their minds
Hear the thunder roaring high
Where the everlasting chain of time awaits
One desire in the dead of the night
To the red horizon
Black Pearl sail to find the light
Dying In The Rain
By moonlight we carry the flame
but the nightfall won't take away the pain
No shadows awaits on the road
still the echo of yesterday remains
On a cold and misty journey
in the silence of the woods
we are chasing great illusions
forever in her realm
She's the lady of the twilight
and the only one who knows
When the trees of sorrow whisper
no one is alive
The eyes of tomorrow are blind
no matter how the wind cries
The sighs of the forest are loud
A sound that never ends
We sail away again
on a broken dream
We've paid the price and more
but still we are not free
We are dying in the rain
Silent dying in the rain
Look out!
Like a million tears of anger
the unspoken fly away
On the lonely road to nowhere
no words are allowed
The wise have abandoned their souls
to wander naked and cold
The proud are invisible fools
whose failure never ends
Dying in the rain
We are dying in the rain
Fighting
Countdown! The time is right
We got a final war to fight
On the road again
We're blood bound. We're dynamite
Rise up! It's do or die
There's only one way to survive
Ride against the wind
and don't stop for anyone
Lightning, thunder
They can't break our storm asunder
Aiming higher, it's here and now
Keep on fighting - Never back down or surrender
Keep on fighting - Tell the world you're alive
Keep on fighting - You were born to rock forever
Keep on fighting - There is no compromise
Breakout! It's time to burn
We've heard the call. There's no return
Leave the past behind
and fly straight into the sun
Stand proud and hold your gun
The revolution has begun
There's a world to win
so don't stop until you've won
All of the time, keeping the fight alive, all of the time
Aaaah Aaaah! Keeping the fight alive until we die
...there's no compromise
Shadow Rider
Beyond the rainbow
where the seas are burning
bells of fate and fortune toll
Heed the warning of the shadow rider
On the fields of honour the battle has begun
Men of war are claiming their rights
Fighting under banners to the bitter end
Unaware of my guarding eye
I'm the lord of the fallen
The great beholder of Life and Death
I'm the lord of the fallen
The one who follows you night and day
When your time is running out
and the angels call your name
I'll be waiting beyond the grave
Hunting at the border in the name of God
Holy knights with blood on their hands
Blinded by the promise of the afterlife
They are all welcomed to my land
Oooh Oooh I'm the shadow rider
Oooh Oooh I'm the shadow rider
Yeeeeeeah
I'm the shadow rider
and I'm coming for you
Lonely Ball Of Fate
Don't wait for your salvation to arise
The undying winter never leaves the mind
Black is the path I wander
Black are the clouds I'm under
The uncertain future echoes in the dark
Welcome to the castle of the damned
Come inside and listen to God's hymn to my life
Scarlet blood of the angels are falling down
when my shadow is dancing on the lonely ball of fate
Saddened clouds of oblivion conceal the sun
when my shadow is dancing on the lonely ball of fate
Don't look beyond the border of your life
The enchanting window always fools the eye
Bound to the never changing
sound of the raven's black wings
We all wear the thorny crown until the end
Welcome to the final masquerade
Come inside and see the abject symphony play
Learning to die from my requiem
I'm learning to die from my requiem
Learning to die from my requiem
I'm learning to die from my requiem
Guardian
Have you forgotten the end of your dream?
Are you afraid of tomorrow?
Will you remember the song of the earth
when there is no light to follow?
When the dark lord appears to embrace our mortal souls
will you then be strong and believe
or welcome the tears of rage to your eyes?
Father of shadows and father of time
You are the guardian of our lives
Father of shadows and father of time
Who will be guarding us when your eyes are closed?
Have you abandoned the path of the brave
to roam in silence forever?
Only the burden of losses remains
inside the void of your chamber
Sometimes I hear your voice
Far away, calling my name but I know
The words in the wind are my own
The Charioteer
From the plains of power
Whine the last stormy winds
For the guardian of Midgard
A final journey begins
By Odin's side
With the aesir gods behind,
A distant voice enters his mind
Lord of the sky, you're running out of time
The serpent will poison your sublime
Thunder and lightning may have dyed your blood
But you can't escape the twilight of the gods
With the hammer you have crushed
All who stood in your way
But strength and deity
Won't help you on the final day
As chaos reigns
And the Valkyries sing,
A warning is sent only for him
Lord of the sky, you're running out of time
The serpent will poison your sublime
Thunder and lightning may have dyed your blood
But you can't escape the twilight of the gods
Lord of the sky, you're running out of time
The serpent will poison your sublime
Thunder and lightning may have dyed your blood
But you can't escape the twilight of the gods
Charioteer - You're a warrior without peer
Charioteer - But your grandeur will end right here
Charioteer - Charioteer - You're a warrior without peer
Charioteer - Charioteer - But your grandeur will end right here
Confessions Of The Maker
When you think you're alone
The eyes of the world will read your mind for me
I'm the author of life
The maker of love and hate, tragedy and fate
I'm the chain, you're the slave
I'll be there from the cradle to the grave
All wars were mine, created for joy
I'm guilty of every crime
When you cry in tears I smile in delight
I am the answer to what you fear
And all that you see
My pleasure is your destiny
When you stand in the rain,
Abandoned and naked, I can not deny
My desire to plague
Well, my rules are mean, but fair and valid everywhere
I'm the wolf, you're the lamb
In my world you are forever damned
All wars were mine, created for joy
I'm guilty of every crime
When you cry in tears I smile in delight
I am the answer to what you fear
And all that you see
My pleasure is your destiny
Once you're born you'll find yourself
Placed behind the scenes of the theatre of pain
Dazed and hollow you will dwell
Until it is your turn to take part in the play of God
All wars were mine, created for joy
I'm guilty of every crime
When you cry in tears I smile in delight
I am the answer to what you fear
And all that you see
My pleasure is your destiny
Northern Rage
Restless and fierce we're approaching this unspoiled new ground
Eager to kill, feast and rape in this new land we've found
The moon is high, but no one knows
What's landed by the bay
In your town soon blood will flow
Just before the dawn of day
Warriors from the land of the midnight sun
Wield your axes for live shall none
For your gold and the slaughter
We have sailed far on stormy waters
Many coasts have been conquered and laid to rest
On our great never-ending quest
There is nothing to stop the northern rage
In this dark and violent age
At midnight we reach our target and the plundering begins
We slay every one of you as we enjoy our sins
The massacre echoes in the night, filled with grief and pain
When the last home burn in the morning light, nothing here remains
Warriors from the land of the midnight sun
Wield your axes for live shall none
For your gold and the slaughter
We have sailed far on stormy waters
Many coasts have been conquered and laid to rest
On our great never-ending quest
There is nothing to stop the northern rage
In this dark and violent age
Longing for glory
We're the masters of the sea
Anger's our story
Gold and blood are all we need
Encouraged by the Gods
Our journey shall go on forever
Warriors from the land of the midnight sun
Wield your axes for live shall none
Warriors from the land of the midnight sun
Wield your axes for live shall none
For your gold and the slaughter
We have sailed far on stormy waters
Many coasts have been conquered and laid to rest
On our great never-ending quest
There is nothing to stop the northern rage
In this dark and violent age
The Fool'S Ballet
Welcome to earth,
A circus where the clowns are in control
Welcome to life,
A state of hysteria programmed in your soul
Don't talk, don't think,
Don't feel, stay out of the way
Just be glad and grateful
For your soon ending days
We are all the chosen ones
Dressed up for God's masquerade
Without a stage and audience
We dance the fool's ballet
There's justice for all
Behind the beautiful but false facade
Here women and men,
Young and old are playing the great mortal's charade
Don't talk, don't think,
Don't feel, stay out of the way
Just be glad and grateful
For your soon ending days
We are all the chosen ones
Dressed up for God's masquerade
Without a stage and audience
We dance the fool's ballet
Almighty father, thank you for all
The fun and excitement on your great ball
No matter what you have planned for us
We'll perform until we fall
We are all the chosen ones
Dressed up for God's masquerade
Without a stage and audience
We dance the fool's ballet
The Terror
So you want to hear a tale, you say?
A true story from my younger days?
I'll try to recall, so now listen well
As I tell you about this demon from Hell
Far to the north, into the barren Wastes we went, my companions and I
To a place where the lost stronghold of king Tharngrim was said to lie
After many a peril we found it, but a shadow hung over the place
We were told of a prophecy. A demon returning one of these days
Shortly the keep was beset by a tide of Chaos, and we were pushed back
To the innermost hall, where we prepared a last stand for the final attack
Though we had fought hard and well our hopes were dead and gone,
For we all knew that the worst was yet to come
So there we stood in silence and stark fear, awaiting our fate
Then the silence ended as a tremendous force shattered the last gate
Ablaze in the darkness of the smashed gate was a pair of eyes. Like burning coal
It was violence incarnate, terrifying beyond comprehension to behold
Then it spoke with a roaring voice, and eyes shining brightly with insane bloodthirst
"I've come back, just as I promised. Well, little dwarfs, who wants to die first?"
Like a blood soaked god it came, truly the terror of its name
For the blood and souls it came, for an old debt to be claimed
As the prophecy foretold the foul demon returned
And the noble king Tharngrim painfully learned
That yesterdays glory can be turned into tomorrows doom
When he faced the Terror down in the mountain's gloom
Its axe rose and fell in great bloody arcs, turning the floor into a red lake
As it ploughed through the dwarf host and left a crimson ruin in its wake
And despite the sentinel's determination to protect their king
I witnessed the prophecy come true as the king was slain by this vile thing
Well, the story has come to an end
I hope you have enjoyed the tale, my friend
But listen to me, and listen well
They do exist, these demons from Hell
So now be sure to remember, my son,
That Chaos snare the unwary one
The unwary one
Panic
My life is a bloody mess
To my body I have no access
I know what is right, but I'm not in charge
I can't let go of the knife
That I just have raised to end your life
One more awful crime to torture my mind
Let me out. Let me out of here
I just can't take it no longer
Let me go, and leave me alone
Before I go insane
Born to run, and follow the sight
Of despair, chaos and fright
Desperate taking soul after soul
I'm out of control
In panic I am damned to live my life
My actions are not of my will,
But they seem to give my brain a thrill
I can not resist my heinous slaughter
I'm caught in a mad machine
Destruction and death are all I've seen
How can I escape this hellish nightmare?
Let me out. Let me out of here
I just can't take it no longer
Let me go, and leave me alone
Before I go insane
Born to run, and follow the sight
Of despair, chaos and fright
Desperate taking soul after soul
I'm out of control
Born to run, and follow the sight
Of despair, chaos and fright
Desperate taking soul after soul
I'm out of control
In panic I am damned to live my life
White Wolves
The day of our revenge is dawning with a chilling haze
Like the day we fell from grace
It was a shameful black day when our bravery failed
But today valour shall prevail
Under the rising sun the mist of the morning clears,
Revealing a forest of spears
A loathsome crawling mass of filth, roaring with bloodlust
Well, this time they will be crushed
Charge!
The thunder of pounding hooves below
Heralds the doom of our foes
Like thunder we descend upon our prey
For our shame they will pay
Might and honour
Now we shall restore our tarnished name and pride
Might and valour
Once again the White Company of Wolves rides
Into battle and war
With the sound of horns and the rumbling roll of drums
We attack the tainted scum
Shouting war cries like howling wolves we ride down the slope
Our hearts filled with fierce joy and hope
No more shall we have to feel the infamous bitter pain,
Or bow our heads in shame
By death or victory our honour shall be restored
So, in the name of our Lord
Charge!
The thunder of pounding hooves below
Heralds the doom of our foes
Like thunder we descend upon our prey
For our shame they will pay
Might and honour
Now we shall restore our tarnished name and pride
Might and valour
Once again the White Company of Wolves rides
Into battle and war
With fury singing in our veins
We smite our fallen leader's bane
Our hammers are smashing a gory
Path to redemption and sweet glory
Might and honour
Now we shall restore our tarnished name and pride
Might and valour
Once again the White Company of Wolves rides
Into battle and war
Into battle and war
The Burning Vision
Another day to fight for my unspoken rights
How can you say it's worth the price
You pay in a cage of lies?
Another chapter in the daily book if sin
Here I'm supposed to walk along
A path which I know is wrong
You may say I aim too high,
But I know what I have to do
I can't see the reason why
The old dream should not come true
Out of the void
Against the wind of madness
Into tomorrow I sail with my hope
No time to waste
I'm heading for the future
I'll carry on till I finally reach
My burning vision
Tired of being the prey and always hearing them say
You can not raise a family
Lost in a fantasy
Detested by the fools who never break a rule
But their eternal jealousy
Won't change my destiny
You may say I aim too high,
But I know what I have to do
I can't see the reason why
The old dream should not come true
Out of the void
Against the wind of madness
Into tomorrow I sail with my hope
No time to waste
I'm heading for the future
I'll carry on till I finally reach
My burning vision
When dreams and memories collide
I'll be leaving for the final ride
Just like the wind I'll travel across the seas
Under skies of glory I will fly, forever free
Laughing at the pain in my past
Out of the void
Against the wind of madness
Into tomorrow I sail with my hope
No time to waste
I'm heading for the future
I'll carry on till I finally reach
My burning vision
Revolution In The Shadowland
Rain - A million tears to the ground
Wind - The unmistakable sound of war
The rebellion has begun
Our freedom must be won
To the castle of tyranny we ride
Tear down the walls
Hunt the King out of his halls
Dethrone the One and we'll be in command
What ever we'll meet,
We won't surrender nor retreat
Freedom we claim to the Shadowland
No more lies. Let the crown of the tyrant fall
It's the final battle of the Shadowland
Glory days and peace are waiting for us all
It's the revolution of the Shadowland
Fight for all the painful years
When all we felt was fear
Drawn by insurrection we will prevail
Closer we come
Now we know what's to be done
The message we have for his majesty
Die tonight!
No more lies. Let the crown of the tyrant fall
It's the final battle of the Shadowland
Glory days and peace are waiting for us all
It's the revolution of the Shadowland
Rebels of the brave
Never loose your faith
Let us end it all tonight
Hold on to your hearts and fight
No more lies. Let the crown of the tyrant fall
It's the final battle of the Shadowland
Glory days and peace are waiting for us all
It's the revolution of the Shadowland
Shadowland
Shadowland
Shadowland
Terminal Voyage
A cold and endless void of glimmering bright souls I see
Drifting around our sad and mundane reality
An astral plane filled with strange harmony
Where the dead march on, through infinity
But I don't know where they go
No one's come back to tell me the truth
Have you ever wondered what's beyond
Your terrestrial life and corporal bonds?
Have you ever pondered on what's out there,
When your life is over and finished here?
The greatest mystery of all
On golden rays of light. On shining silvery beams
Ethereal beings float in beautiful glittering streams
Dancing slowly towards the unknown
To a place our Maker has shown?
Well, I don't know where they go
No one's come back to tell me the truth
Have you ever wondered what's beyond
Your terrestrial life and corporal bonds?
Have you ever pondered on what's out there,
When your life is over and finished here?
The greatest mystery of all
All these souls, like a billion fires,
Illuminate the void as life expires
But like grains of sand they are blown astray
On a terminal voyage
On a terminal voyage they sail
On a terminal voyage they sail away
Silent Angel
Lies, empty words in the wind
A tragic melody
Unwise is the one who believe in tomorrow
The shade of a loser never fades away
Until the story ends
But there is a light where I lonely stray
And the light is you my friend
Silent angel from above
Take me on your wings of love
Fly me far away from here
Show me the way to the silence
Free is the one with a name
Carved in a tombstone
Tell me, am I the one to blame for my life?
The pain is eternal when I realise,
All my thoughts were true
There's neither a Heaven nor a paradise
All I can believe is in you
Silent angel from above
Take me on your wings of love
Fly me far away from here
Show me the way to the silence
I see her face in the crowds,
The darkness and the clouds
I'll wait for her until
I find eternal tranquillity
Silent angel from above
Take me on your wings of love
Fly me far away from here
Show me the way to the silence
