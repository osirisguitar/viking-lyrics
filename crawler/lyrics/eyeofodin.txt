The Sacrifice
We had always known them
The southern cult of the white one
Who came with swords
Under a banner of peace
My cousin, lord of the wolves,
Welcomed them into our lands
In the spirit of prosperity
We watched as our temples were enshackled
Imprisoned behind cathedral walls
Until we could bear their prattle no longer
We would protect our temples,
Our very way of life,
With a pact: an oath of law
And so we crossed the wave-road
To meet with them in peace
But they betrayed us
And as my lord ran into battle
I heard him speak his final words:
“Surrounded, outnumbered, five hundred to one
Tonight, I will see the gates of Valhalla!”
The Blood Of Many
Pushing the lines of my brothers
Charging on into the fray
The sweat and the mud and the smell of the blood
Carry me on to a tale of history
Surrounded, outnumbered, five hundred to one
We’ll taste of defeat on this day
By the will and the glory of Thor’s iron hammer
Carry me on to a tale of victory
Surrounded, outnumbered, no hope of retreat
The brothers will lay in the dirt
Blade slash, blood splash, move past, war!
Killing for glory, my place by the king
To hallow the hall of Valhalla
Blade slash, blood splash, kill fast, war!
I run into battle engorged with the rage
I’ll kill many men on this day
Bringing destruction, the dance of the brothers
In the frenzy of our final melee
My blade and my hammer, my tooth and my nail
Are tasting the blood of many!
Swinging the hammer, thrusting the blade
My enemies fall to the dirt
Blade slash, blood splash, kill fast, war!
Killing for glory to bathe in their entrails
And wade through the blood of many!
Move past, kill fast, world smashed, blood bath!
I have fallen
Who knows when I was struck?
My face swells with pain
And my tongue rings with the tang of blood
As I rise I see the field
Is covered with the carrion bird
Above, the ravens peer down
Circling the front line of battle
I have been resting it seems
While my brothers are fighting on
I am not done yet!
I have not yet earned my place!
I have no honour!
I have not earned my stay in Valhalla!
As I take to foot
Wading through the bodies
Of my enemies and my brothers
I’m reminded of the tale of Ragnarok
The greatest of all wars!
I’ll fight!
I run into battle unable to see
Blinded by the blood of many
By the will and the glory of Thor’s golden hammer
Carry me on to a tale of history
Surrounded, outnumbered, I know my defeat
I’m wasted against this foe
By my wife and my family, my son and my homeland
I cannot allow victory!
Surrounded outnumbered no hope of retreat
The brothers now lay in the dirt
Move fast, blade slash, blood splash
Killing for glory, my place by the king
To hallow the hall of Valhalla
Move fast, kill fast, until the last is defeated!
The blood of many, the blood of many, the blood of many, war!
Endless Horizon
We are wandering warriors on the waves
In the cold northern fjordlands
We’re coming to your homelands on the sea
With his eye on our side
Odin, king of the Aesir, guides our hearts
On the path to Valhalla
With shimmering swords and brightly shining spears
We will conquer your kind
So we ride on the endless horizon
Yes, we sail to take what we need.
We will ride on the endless horizon
We sail across the sea
Turn the sail hard to port!
So we ride on the endless horizon
Yes, we sail to take what we need.
We will ride on the endless horizon
We sail across the sea
We leave your town in ashes and in flames
Proud to have been your foes
We conquered all your kindred and your homes
And taken all that we need
We’re sailing on to a new horizon
Endlessly we shall go
Ahti, guide our ship to safety and to our next victory
We will ride on the endless horizon
Yes, we sail on to victory!
We will ride on the endless horizon
Valhalla calls to me!
I the viking warrior!
I the motherless son!
I the slayer of families
Why? I have no one!
I the wandering warrior!
I the unstoppable foe!
I will burn and pillage
Why? I have no home!
Why?
Saga Of The Winterborn Part I: Lord Of The Wolves
My cousin was the lord
Of these islands of the sun
The farthest south that we had come
And there we met our fiercest foe
The Christians, they were called,
Denied our gods and our heroes
Denied our legends and our history
They denied Baldur, Odin’s son
We could not bear it, could not allow
The south to rise up and thrust us out
We’ll send them back to their homes
To the city of Rome
My cousin, Lord of the Wolves
Went to the south to face his enemy
But they betrayed him with an army
The biggest one I’ve ever seen!
He sent me to the North
To the lands of our fathers
To represent our southern homeland
To the Kingdom of dragon’s fire
For fifteen years we have sought you
The Winterborn, I’ve heard you called
The fiercest of warriors
In these islands, you’ll rule them all
And boldly they went across the sea
To the place they knew they would find the Winterborn
For fifteen years they had sought the boy
And when at last they found him
They raised their blades up to Odin
You see your father was a hero
He was a king amongst his men
And he was slaughtered by the Christians
You must avenge him my cousin’s son.
For fifteen years we have sought you
Just awaiting for this day
We will not back down, cannot allow
The tale to end this way
As I continue my quest
I am confident that I will find you
You are the Son of the North
And the King of my people
Yes I have rallied from the North
Ten thousand men to drive them out
Yes, we will burn all the churches
In these islands of the sun
You see your father was a hero
He was a king amongst his men
And he was slaughtered by the Christians
You must avenge him my cousin’s son.
For fifteen years we have sought you
Just awaiting for this day
We will not back down, cannot allow
The tale of Winterborn to end this way
Saga Of The Winterborn Part II: Dirge Of Winterborn
Been many days since he departed from this shore
That snow white smile, those ice blue eyes
His child is in me, a mother I may be
To a child of winter, born to sail the sea
Been many weeks now, he left on a Drekkar
With a loathsome dragon, on its prow
He’s called a hero, a king amongst his men
From mortal foes by his blade or life he’ll defend
And I wonder where he may be
And I wonder when he’ll come home to me
Been many months now since I’ve seen his gentle face
That snow white smile, those ice blue eyes
And when I see him, a raging I will be
“Where have you been, did you care that you worried me?”
It’s been so long now since I’ve heard his gentle voice
He used to sing me lullabies
His son’s delivered from my womb’s clutching embrace
Will he ever see him? will he ever know his face?
I begin to believe I never will again
I begin to understand he is gone
Winterborn, I know I can’t go on
My heart is broken and I will surely die!
Winterborn, I give you to the night
And now you’ll either learn to fight or die alone!
Winterborn, there is no turning back
Your father’s gone and I have died
Winterborn, I give you to the North,
You’ll become the best of us or die alone…
And I wonder where you may go…
Saga Of The Winterborn Part III: Son Of The North
What it means to be a warrior
To sail the seas and conquer foes
Hold your head high, blades pointed to the sky
It is within you to drive them out
I will not back down
I cannot allow
The south to rise up
And thrust us out
To be a hero, you must know
The eye of Odin will not touch your foes
So do not back down from any foe you face
Leave none behind you that stand in your way
I will not back down
I cannot allow
The south to rise up
And thrust us out
Come with me across the sea, me boy
Adventure awaits!
The viking warriors
In the islands of the south
With bloody weapons and angry eyes
We drive the enemy out
With confidence in out hearts
Blades pointed to the sky
No one can defeat us, my lad
Though many of us may die
To be a warrior
Takes everything you’ve got
Our hearts cry out for victory
Our rage is burning hot!
Valhalla calls to us!
Odin waits on high!
Praise to Mjolnr, never stop!
Leave no one left alive!
What does it mean to be a warrior?
Come with me to the land of our foes
Your father’s gone, your mother, she is dead
The Son of the North will have revenge
My cousin, Lord of the Wolves
Come to the south and face our enemy
We will betray them with an army
The biggest one they’ve ever seen!
You see you see your father was a hero
He was a king amongst his men
And he was slaughtered by the Christians
You must avenge him my cousin’s son
Fifteen long years we have sought you
Just awaiting for this day
We sail for days across the ocean
To land in this hidden bay
The Hall At The End Of The Earth
After the journey is over
And the trails have all come to an end
At the end of years, there’ll be no more fears
Only a ship sailing off into the clear
After this life is over
In a hall at the end of the earth
They will serve to you the finest brew
A mead twice as cool as morning dew
Long have I sought in search of respite,
For the hall at the end of the earth
I first heard the tale on the darkest of nights
When my fears denied my worth.
In a crashing thunderstorm,
I thrashed upon the rocks.
I sank into the water, then
I thought that I was lost,
Alone on the sea
My heart was in doubt
I saw the kings of warriors
I heard them singing out!
I sailed for a year and a day with those men
The price I had paid for my life.
I’d all but forgotten the song I had heard
In the blackest of my darkest nights.
Then there came a day,
The wand’rer came my way
He wore a cloak and an ashen beard
And these words I heard him say
“Kindly show the way,
To an old man in decay,
Your life is all but over now,
You and I must not delay!”
Do you know the way to the hidden valley?
Long is the way that we must go!
Over the waves and the wat’rey alleys,
There they brew the finest mead I know!
And on the third day we set out from port,
The old man disappeared
That night, the sun went down beyond the edge of the sea
Never to rise up again.
For nine long weary nights
We tumbled without day
Until one morn we saw the light
Of the glittering Bifrost way
Standing on the rocks
As we could plainly see
Was Heimdall, lord of the sky-mountain
Staring down at me!
The figure rose out of the mist
With eyes that burned like fire
He raised his blade to the sky
And this is what he said:
“You must go over the great rainbow bridge, my new friends, into the city of Asgard! There you will find the golden hall you seek, and Odin, king of the Aesir!”
We had come to our final destination!
To the great walled city of the Gods!
We raised our blades up to Odin, the king!
To Asgard, and the great Valhalla!
But at the end of the day,
The wanderer came our way
And said, “Don these holy instruments
And let these bastards here you play!
For there will come a day
When everything will die
The Fenris Wolf and the World Serpent
Will hear this joyous cry!”
Do you know the way to the hidden valley?
Long is the way that we must go!
Over the waves and the wat’rey alleys,
There they brew the finest mead I know!
