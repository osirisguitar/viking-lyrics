Ferrum Aeternum
Iron
The silence breaks the ground
A shadow is riding the horizon
An arcane man arrives to town
Remoresless and condemned
Tasted the snake's poison
Broken every bone
Felt a thousand gunshot wounds
But there's nothing that whiskey can't cure
Ride Through the crossfire
Ride Through the flames, like a predator in the night
The eagles fly into eternal sunset
The heroes die, dying for their pride
Awoken to heavy galloping
I heard the blasting whiplash
Eyes are filled with lust to kill
Beware, he's crying out your name
Now the time has come
When the Iron tears the heart
And the trumpets will ring loudly
As the stars are painted with blood
Blazing fire under the moon
Burning taste of lead
We'll ride forever
Cause' the Iron is stronger than death
Sword Chant
A flaming blade of the dark shadows struck the lands
With furious lightning it fell into the hands of man
And the ancient fire came down
Down from the sky into the ground
The clouds moved aside as the sword was cast from the sky
Burnt by a mark of fire, who shall make this find
And the grey clouds were watching down, down from the sky into the ground
...As the shapes of light were drowned
Courage's started crowling from the ashes and smoke
And the night was cursed and drifting within the winds so cold
And the knights from the sea were marching down
To the deep caverns down, down where the old spells are found
The war was growing in the old lands and towns
From the mountains war drums pounded with a deafening sound
They'll seek the Sword forevermore, until in battle they'll fall
...Now, hear the battle's call
Who dares to play with death
Who smells the dragon's breath
No grief for the fallen ones
The search for the sword has begun
Great as the mountains and seas
Grim as the earth and old trees
Made from the glimmer of golden lakes
Chained with fire that never fades
Rocks and stones they carve and mould
When the rivers run fierce and cold
May this chant haunt your past
For this Sword is yours at last
Raise the arms the battle is near
Through the mud and waters clear
The blood is coloring the lands again
A sign of victory the wind will send
Mourning Heart (Interlude)
Tale Of Revenge
He bears a tale so gloom and tragic never to be known
Into darkness now fallen, into hatred now grown
Like stillborn child drifting in the silent seas
Of blood, crushing all his dreams
No castle walls can hold the fury in his eyes
Devotion for death, now controls his life
No gold or silver can bring him consolation
Only one thing is left inside him, the desire of revenge
One light so cold and pale, sleeping quietly all alone
One life so old and gray, wandering away from home
Parted with a horrid cry, snow falls on his grief
United by the sword of wicked screams
What deeds he has done to hear those deadful sounds
In the ruins of memories he wanders, forever bound
Forever bound to death!
Wait for me in the mountains, haunt me in the winds
Wait for me in the land where nothing lives
Until the day I have found revenge, I will feed my sword
Until my heart is cold, every breath of mine is yours
Lost In Despair
I was lost, on my own
And I couldn't bear the thought of my life
I was gone, caught in the torturing memories
And they burned like fire
Water can never heal such pain
Can't you believe
Nothing is real
Can't you see
I cannot feel
Take me away
Bury me in the sand
Cause after all these years I am still the same
A sad and bitter man
Crush my hope, grow my hate
There's no home for me
Nothing to give, nothing to say
So tell me it's a dream
Slayer Of Light
I have come to unfold your mind
In my veins runs the poison wild
In the streams of mountains I flow
I have opened the doors for unleashed and endless hate
It will burn like the raging green flames
Inside a man dwell secrets so cold
Through the dreadful storms, across the frozen oceans
I have come from the dark lands with sorrow in my hands
The firewind rages in the sky
And my luminous sword hungers for more
I will leave no one alive
For I am the Slayer of Light
I... I will break your will
I... I will crush your faith
I... I will slay your dreams
I will reclaim the stars and I will tear your precious world apart
I will tear it apart
I will pull everything with me under the surface
And all the screams will fade into my dreams
Fall now! Dying light!
I will burn away the ground beneath your feet
And all will be vanished in the darkness
Dying light! Fall now!
And let the night arrive
Into Battle
We left our homes behind, now we're following the wolves' trail
Through the deepest forests, beneath the stars we ride
I can see the moon glowing red like the blood of warriors
There's a prophecy, that tonight many men will die
The fire will burn forever in our passionate hearts
Our destinies are calling us now
We are ready to take their lives
Into battle we ride with Gods by our side
We are strong and not afraid to die
We have an urge to kill and our lust for blood has to be fulfilled
WE'LL FIGHT TILL THE END! And send our enemies straight to Hell!
Prominent leaders, cast your swords in the wind as a sign of war
Men, prepare for death, 'cause we might never return
Blood will spill and heads will fall
As the swords sparkle, lights the night
The ground rumbles as we attack
In the throes of rage, we will fight
The lightning's flash, the thunder's roar
Will petrify the weak
We'll show no mercy, we'll kill them all!
We are sworn in the name of steel
Lai Lai Hei
Hän katsoi maan reunalta tähteä putoavaa
Nyt kauniit kasvot neitosen peittää karu maa
Jokaisen täytyy katsoa silmiin totuuden
Sillä aika ompi voittoisa, mut' tämä maa on ikuinen
He gazed the falling star from the edge of the world
Now the face of the maiden are covered by rough land
Everyone has to look in the eyes of the truth
Because the time is victorious, but this land is eternal
There's a place in the North, far far away
Home for the wandering man
Dreaming fields with skies so pale
Calm is the glorious land
Flames will send the sign to the sky
That we have come to feast tonight
The lakes are echoing with our song
Shadows are dancing on the forrest wall
Shadows are dancing on the forrest wall!
Enchantment of the fire and moon
Lost in the whispering night
The raven's magic enthralls the woods
Crawling in the sweet starlight
We have gathered in this distant land
Full of wisdom, secrets and tales
The morning will never rise again
Roaming wolves are howling for the dead
Roaming wolves are howling for the dead!
Oh yea!
He watched a falling star, at the edge of the world
Now the maiden's beautiful face is covered in barren earth
Everyone has to look into the eyes of the thruth,
For time is victorious, but this land will always stay true
Tears
Shadows of evening on a traveller's way
Destiny tells where the strange path will lead you
Alone I've been walking this path every day
Under the stars and the white silver moon
I hear a song and I'm closing my eyes
While its sound is carresing my poor and sad mind
Will you tonight give your promise to me
For one day the silence will sleep in your dreams
I've been waiting for so long time
To see the light of the golden bright sun
I feel no sorrow in the heart of mine
For the tears of life are now gone
Winds are whispering in the sacred forest
Dancing and singing with the red autumn leaves
These memories I could never forget
With rising sun I shall be here with thee
Tears
Shadows of evening on a traveller's way
Destiny tells where the strange path will lead you
Alone I've been walking this path every day
Under the stars and the white silver moon
I hear a song and I'm closing my eyes
While its sound is carresing my poor and sad mind
Will you tonight give your promise to me
For one day the silence will sleep in your dreams
I've been waiting for so long time
To see the light of the golden bright sun
I feel no sorrow in the heart of mine
For the tears of life are now gone
Winds are whispering in the sacred forest
Dancing and singing with the red autumn leaves
These memories I could never forget
With rising sun I shall be here with thee

Kalevala Melody (Intro)
Iron
Treacherous Gods
The Land Is Silent... Before The Storm!
On the vast fields of snow, the wind is blowing strong
With it's frozen cold and relentless touch
it leaves a dead and hollow land of ice
I have seen through the eyes of a wolf
and felt all its pain and loneliness
The beautiful land opened before my eyes
wild as a beast I ran into the night
The Calling Of The Howling Wind
Is Raging In The Realms Of North
Creations Of Ice Rising Mighty Into The Skies
And Treacherous Gods Shall Fall
Watching through the falling snow
there's no sign of life
The fire has gone out in the whirl of time
Behold the face of thunder
the storm is getting near
When the sky calls my name, I have no fear
They brought us misfortune, but their honor is about to be crushed
My blood flows cold as streams of the North
We'll never let them take our souls
The calling of the howling wind is raging in the North
Creations of ice, rising mighty into the skies
and Treacherous Gods shall fall
Time And Time Again
I Witness The Birth Of A New Born Star
I Climb The Highest Mountain
To Find The Essence Of A New Era
I guess I tramp these paths
till the end
If you, my love, stand at my side
On these paths the last "cross" is found
To where we are heading together my friend
I wouldn't swap my native region to a foreign
Even though so many would avoid this land
This farm passed from the father to the son
Even though the neighbour sold his.
I listened to my heart
It told stay here
From the world your happiness
you can't find
You came with me
to the shared home
Wilderness too
You loved so much
These roots won't
be detached by the storms
We won't be fallen
because of the breakers of life
To the children we can
Give something
That the children from the cities can't have
If one listens to the heart
It says – stay here
From the world your happiness
You can't find
It is so close,
When you just notice it
And not just reach behind the seas.
Frost
Howling winds of the North
The cold predator of the fells
Mighty woods of the North
Under cover of darkness
Desolate and dying lands
Barren ground, covered with snow
There forever I am,
Where cold winds blow
Gathering thoughts, take me
Into a whirl of silence
Gathering thoughts, give me
Strength to survive
Wail to me my winds
Fly away with frozen wings
Take my life to your hands
O' cold wasteland... of Frost
Great land of the North
The ice shimmering upon the lakes
Great storms of the North
All life frozen to death
Freezing days of sorrow
I'm alone in this infertile world
In the year before time
Old Man
So much farther off than time could reach
Today it would be too late
So much despair he has bled
But will he wither away
No one knows that you must keep
This Old Man wide awake
'cause no one knows that he could feed
Our lives with a brighter flame
Hush little dreamer, the bearer of light
Has come to set you free
Now little dreamer at last you can sigh
'cause the nightmares will be released
Sweeter far than life from I found that love was
Sweeter far than love to die as he did
The stars fell from the nightsky
As he reached his hands in the air
As the sun peeked between the trees
The Old Man burst to tears
Knighthood
I walk through the calm forest in the time of knights
And only the dark memories are left from these times
There's pieces of armour on skeletons
Of men lying on the ground
They were killed by the stab of the sword
Before me lays thousands of dead knights
Beneath of my feets lays skeletons
And only the dark memories
Are left of this Knighthood
On this ground all fought for domination,
But no one stayed alive
And no one knows why that even one life,
Didn't survive
It must have been the powers of evil,
That killed the rest of the men
On this bloodstained ground,
That which stories has been told
The Dreamer's Prelude
Little Dreamer
Once there was a boy back in time of the heathens
Day after day he just kept dreaming things that would make him weaker
His father could not make him see, that there is more than dreams
But he wouldn't listen to the words of his father, 'cause he's a little dreamer
Along his quest for solitude
A wise man came and told him to follow the stars
He ran to the forest with whirlwinds by his side
He's lost in this world of lies
Take him back where rivers flow upwards
He is the one who lives under a moonless sky looking for time
Take him back where stars are shining bright
Far in the lands of icetop mountains far on the other side
Pictures are appearing so serenely into my mind
Far in the lands of meadows of fire deep in forgotten life
Memories are drifting away so silently from light
Along his path of misery
A wise man came and told him to follow... the stars
Little Dreamer...
Warrior's Quest
(Let me tell you a story of a great warrior...)
Strike with the powers of magic stone
Grab your legacy that you behold
If you can find your destiny
Then you may return back to your home
... Ride away with your mighty horse
Ride away through the land of storms...
Unknown ar the ways of your journey ahead
But with strength and courage you can avoid your death
Throw your sword through the memories
Embracing your bleeding heart
Don't follow the shadows they ain't for real
Like guiding stars
As he falls to eternity the truth is fading
Part of him died long time ago but still there's death awaiting
Go now brave warrior don't look back
The stars will guide you through the night
But even the brightest light,
Won't reach to the darkest night...
White Storm
On this dawn the colours of the autumn are reflected by a light
A light that as been captured for years in oblivion
Circles of wind are raging now
And so his powers are slowly dying
Before the coldness rapes the lands
His spirit is wandering into the night... to DIE!
...and he heard chimes ahead playing these enchanted notes,
That lead him to a wooden cabin, where he could rest for the night...
Over the mountains
He had travelled
Across the oceans
Deep in the night
Now when it's time to
Say last farewell
Show us your power
Show us your might
Gift from the sky
His eyes can see it so clearly now
But his restless mind cannot sense it in the air
THE WHITE STORM IS CLOSE!
...and his powers gained in this mystical place more than he ever
Posessed before.
So now he could rule the realms of ice... ONCE AGAIN!
Intro
Hero In A Dream
A witch read from the palm of his hand
That his life would turn into darkness
And alone he would face all demons
From his past that he tries to forget
An elder king warned of the dangers
That lie in the valleys of north and
His only chance was to find his shadow
So he had to set forth
He is the man who travels in the land
Of dragons and magic spells
He rides in the winds of fire and snow
And he rules the forest of elves
Slash of the golden sword
A flash in the burning night
Curse of the evil lord
He is fighting for his life for the last time
Oh such beauty in time, but it's just external
He cannot see the truth with his eyes, so he is bound by a lie
The snow starts falling in paradise, as he gazes at the stars
He will be born again in the sky, when the night turns into a dawn
On the way to the ancient castle of time
He will soon be damned by rage
So that his pride could betray him
When it's time to set him free
The fears in his mind had to be pushed aside
As he walked through the gates
He will never die
'cause he is truly a Hero in a Dream
Eternal Wait
Over the Forgotten sea
Voice of angel is calling for me
Somewhere, where the mountains collide
That's where I'll find my new life
I have carried this burden so long for you
That nothing but sorrow I feel
I have let myself believe
That nothing would hurt deeper than the truth
Never has the wind blown like thousand years ago
Everything that I've known has left me on my own
Never have I felt the rain fall down like the burning flames
All I see is the face of eternal wait
I hear your silent cry
Lost in the rainy night
No reason to live for
One reason to die for
I am the one who has fallen into the path of shadows
(and that road never seems to end)
I am the one who has drowned into the river of tears
Battle Song
Let's go
Hear the sound of swords fulfill the night
Feel the winds of death on your skin
See the arrows fly, flaming in the sky
Hear the screams of men, as they die
We won this battle wit might and fearless hearts
We came and we fulfilled our prophecy
So now we shall march back towards our kingdom
With heads up high and glimmering eyes
We returned with our glory
Silence now falls upon this blood red field
Vultures feasting with the flesh of dead bodies
"This is a great moment for all of us
But now it's time to head back home victorious"
Guardians Of Fate
Race with the wind
The night is ending
They will win
When the sun is rising
Stories have been told for years about the rebel man
Riding in the lands of unknown
No one has ever seen their furious beings
And their secret remains untold
Their deeds shall be heard
Their legend will live forever
They are the Guardians Of Fate
As they shouted their last battle cries their destiny was to be dead
Their future was in no one's hands like the prophet of the moon had said
Those who travelled far away from home, they'll never return
And those who crossed the seas of hope, they all will burn

Token Of Time
Harvest the field of time
with the old man's scythe
The narrow path of the chosen one
reaches beyond life
I set sails for the ageless winds
No fear of dying or a thought of surrender
I threaten every barrier on my way
I am bound forever with Token of Time
Among the humble people
Everything is torn apart
but I'm blessed with faith
and bravely I shall go on
Are thou the bringer of hope and joy
that I've waited for years
I shall fight to restore the moon
Wisdoms of time are carved on the sacred wood
Do thou possess spiritual powers
that would dispel all my fears
I shall not die until the seal is broken
Token of Time is trusted in the hands of the chosen one

Little Dreamer...
Abandoned
Sing for your tears
a song of the hatred
No one can hear
'cause your life is forgotten
I want to give my life to you
but my will is tied with puppet strings
I am fighting and screaming alone
inside this empty room
They let you down, threw you in the rain
They let you down, sent you away... without a name
The night is dark when you're alone
and sometimes it can be so cruel
The rain keeps falling on me so coldly
'cause your wishes didn't come true
Nothing seems real anymore
as I dive into the sea of lies
I don't understand this sorrow
that keeps me sane
Windrider
He appears from the mists of a dismal lake
and the sky crumbles as he flies through the dimensions alone
The night has laid a cape on his shoulders
and with a grin on his face he attacks with his loyal soldiers, into the unknown
There's no place for him in this world, and no ties
and all this hate and grief unite in his mind
Windrider - seeks freedom with vengeance on his mind
to escape from the crimson skygrave and fly away
Windrider - is waiting for the final day
when he'll be released from the shackles of a slave
In the eye of the storm he rides with jaded memories of his life
as the fires are dancing colorfully, he is struggling to survive
Trapped in a maze, can't get away, what have you became now
Take the hammer of the elders and crush your way out
His presence is shaking the land
as he stands at the mountain peak
His instincts are getting weak,
but there is still hunger in his eyes, that keeps him alive
He wears the mask of the hunted
Arts of light for him have been granted
He lives in the fragments of time
waiting for his time to die
...Windrider...
Treacherous Gods
The Land Is Silent... Before The Storm!
On the vast fields of snow, the wind is blowing strong
With its frozen cold and relentless touch
it leaves a dead and hollow land of ice
I have seen through the eyes of a wolf
and felt all its pain and loneliness
The beautiful land opened before my eyes
wild as a beast I ran into the night
The Calling Of The Howling Wind
Is Raging In The Realms Of North
Creations Of Ice Rising Mighty Into The Skies
And Treacherous Gods Shall Fall
Watching through the falling snow
there's no sign of life
The fire has gone out in the whirl of time
Behold the face of thunder
the storm is getting near
When the sky calls my name, I have no fear
They brought us misfortune, but their honor is about to be crushed
My blood flows cold as streams of the North
We'll never let them take our souls
The calling of the howling wind is raging in the North
Creations of ice, rising mighty into the skies
and Treacherous Gods shall fall

So now we shall march back towards our kingdom
With heads up high and glimmering eyes

Silence now falls upon this blood red field
Vultures feasting with the flesh of dead bodies
"This is a great moment for all of us
but now it's time to head back home victorious"
Goblins' Dance
Once in the time of chaos,
of sunless days and of unhappiness
The statue of the triumphant master
stood proud and grim
In the light of three descending moons,
it twisted and cracked open
Unleashing the Goblin King,
once again, for the last time
"Now the Victory is ours!"
"Let us dance the dance of Immortals"
They shrieked, as they marched
up and down the hills,
in the sighing face of earth
Misfortune and Chaos,
Grief and Destruction
The works of Dreaming evil,
and the joy of unholiness
No soul was left alone,
in the mayhem of the human race
"Hahahahaa!!!, Let us joy, Let us dance!!!"
So they danced their macabre dances
From the three ascending moons,
moonshine was spilling onto the ground,
Gruesome trophies were all around,
In the halls of the Goblin King
By The Dividing Stream
From Afar
A raven came to me,
Spoke to me in my dream.
A long lost prophecy,
A forgotten legacy.
Echoes of yesterday,
Won't let these dreams fade away.
All the beauty I adored,
At the edge of the world.
Across the universe,
Time is to be reversed.
No shelter can be found,
To this fate, we are bound!
Behold the final hour,
The last times will be dour.
All life falls into gorge
Of the end of the world!
"Burning skies
On the vengeance night.
Devastating scythe,
Of the ancient Light."
I saw the might,
Of the ancient Light!
And the beauty of the perishing world,
Theres no tomorrow.
We have been warned.
"The sky's bird struck fire,
Made a flame flare up.
The north wind burnt the clearing.
The north-east quite consumed it:
It burnt all the trees to ash and reduced them to dust."
Twilight Tavern
We heard that enemies were approaching from the south
We marched to face them, I killed their scout
But we were ambushed and slaughtered in the night
We fought so bravely but none were left alive
Now I open my eyes and what do I see
A rainbow in the moonlight, pipers calling me
They say don't be afraid and asked me to follow
You've been expected, so forget your sorrow!
Their warrior's souls forever rejoice
TWILIGHT TAVERN!
With our ancestors we raise our horns
TWILIGHT TAVERN!
Their warrior's swords forever shine on
TWILIGHT TAVERN!
Welcoming our brothers at the break of dawn!
TWILIGHT TAVERN!
Life is so short (Life is so short)
Oh! son of the north (Oh son of north)
You'll find your peace
At the end of your journey
Hey! All greet us when we open the door
Familiar faces -- "Brothers, it's been too long"
Beer is flowing, the smell of burning meat
In the morning battle reigns like hell's been unleashed!
As the sun sets behind the mountains peak,
The master of the house shouts: "Drink and feast!"
This feels like it is too good to be true.
The call for the final battle will be here soon
Heathen Throne
This hate inside me,
It is constantly growing.
Years of hollow lies,
Made pagan hatred rise.
They came with their troops,
Destroying land and roots.
Abominations under the sun,
They and their poisoned truth.
One by one my people fell,
Under their deceptive spell.
How many sons of the
Northe, had to fall?
Before our eyes could see
This isn't how it should be!
"Under the Northern star
We shed our blood.
With the call of a battle horn.
We raise our swords.
Behind the fields of blood,
There's a haven for us.
Deep in the woods of the North,
Rises the Heathen Throne"
Upholder of the skies,
For too long has your name been
Despised,
Give us your strength and courage.
When we meet our nemesis.
On the shores that used to be,
The place we called home.
Our land and faith are raped,
Somehow they're going to pay.
Grant us your revenge,
We are not afraid of death.
Let none of them ever more, EVER MORE,
Lay a hopeful gaze upon the sky!
Elusive Reaches
Protector of the sun arrives with light
From the edge of the world to the highest heights.
With a thunder blast he greets his twin,
And falls back to oblivion.
From the western plains where nature blooms.
Roams the swift brother in eternal blue.
Chasing the vanishing golden light.
Hasting towards an endless night.
Across the high northern skies
The eldest brother in all his might.
Guards the frozen barren land
With a token of wisdom in his hand.
Forlorn moon and dreadful mist
The youngest brother raises his fist.
All life slowly withers away
And the infinite circle begins again.
The trail of the winds remains unseen,
For mortals their realm stays concealed.
The ageless skies that stand before our eyes,
When we'll be gone they'll still be flying free.
Silvery light of the sea,
Sparkles of far beneath.
Cold breeze against their brawn,
Reminds them of cold steel and war!
Stone Cold Metal
Howl of a coyote wakes up a man,
A haggard shadow in this wasted land.
Vultures rise with the scorching sun.
A dry wind blows in a silent town.
Some Whiskey to clear his head
And some for the brothers who are dead.
Another day, another chase,
Vigilantes will meet their fate.
Saddle your steed
We are riding tonight
Be ready to kill
Don't flee from a fight.
Pillaging is in our blood,
We bow to no one and no one at all!
Stone cold metal in his hand,
Stirs wild rival of righteous man.
Life of an outlaw the gallows await.
Until then they shall reign!
No border is too sacred
To cross and to spill the cup of hatred.
Days to come are still unveiled,
Take whats yours, no time to bewail!
Waning daylight, time to move on
Under a looming crescent moon.
Another town, again to raze,
Surely someone will pass deaths gate.
In the silence of the night
Treacherous lady of the evening,
Deceived the whereabouts of marauders.
Ten bounty hunters are heading to the hideaway.
A dark red desert moon
Shimmers it gloomy light.
Upon a baneful affair of honour.
For a fleeting moment, eye meets eye.
Silent respect before an inevitable solution.
Dead or alive, Its all the same...
Smoking Ruins
For many years ago
He left his home behind.
No farewells or a note,
Like a thief he fled into the night.
Heart full of foolish pride,
He caused a death of his clans man
All prophesies he denied,
And now in exile he grieves.
Hear the call of the fallen ones
Wisdom of those whose time has gone
Live your life bravely my first born son,
On battlefields fight, don't run.
The wheel of time keeps turning
A boy becomes a man.
But still shame burns him.
At last he understands.
He heads back to his homeland.
He rides fast like a storm wind
But the flames in the horizon,
Tell there is only death to be found.
By the smoking ruins of his past life.
He raises his hand to the skies,
"Oh god of thunder,
God of my fathers,
Strike me down for what I've done!"
Above the darkened woods, blackened ravens sing.
As flows the people's blood, to melt these frozen grounds.
See how glows the sky, how curve the heavens above us.
It beckons, calling us, to the lands beyond the Dark Stream.
Those weakened, to the Darkest of Streams shall drown.
And when heroes, those riverbanks will reach.
The sounds of singing, across eternity shall echo.
Calling our brothers, to journey, afar, beyond the Dark Stream.
The Longest Journey (Heathen Throne Part II)
Could my ruin have come,
My day of trouble have arrived,
In these tuonele cabins
These abodes of the dead land?
Far beyond the dark stream pagan souls will
Roam those cold lands wild and free.
Wait for the sign a blood red sky.
Then beyond the dark stream we will ride.
The path of mortals,
So narrow and brutal.
Only bravest of them all
Will find true valours
Decaying souls of men,
Who trust in false omens,
Will drown in the stream
With their untrue beliefs.
He's been drifting
For so long,
Searching for the land.
Where heroes roam.
In the horizon,
The last ray of light,
A breeze from the other side,
Before he dies.
Dividing walls of stone,
Eternal heathen Throne,
Beneath the cold starlight.
Revealed for the purest sight.
Through constant affliction
Towards alleviations,
When a searing star is near.
Carry on, you're almost here
Far beyond the dark stream we'll meet again.
Across the wilderness and we will be home.
Gather your strength, don't be afraid.
Far beyond the dark stream, we'll meet again.
The longest journey of them all,
Has to be made all alone
A flame in the skyline reaching the stars
Guiding the seeker through the night!
The wanderer has nowhere to go, when he arrived at the end.
The moon will stain all shades of blue, he is the only one left out there.
Far over there from a secluded courtyard, lit the heat into the night.
Raises hunger in his frozen body, which has lived on air and water.
It hurts, but go anyway, you can always go on.
It hurts, but go right, you are here and came here as a wanderer.
Bell rings for a lonely soul, it has borrowed the voice of death.
Does it hurt or want it well, when the count of our destiny.
Stop thinking it is difficult anyway, you may take one day at a time.
The wanderer has nowhere to go, if he goes at the end of the battle.

In My Sword I Trust
Many men have crossed my way
Promising peace and my soul to save
But I've already heard it all
I've seen what they made with their freedom
But I, I have no need for your god
The shallow truth of your poisonous tongue
Brothers, it's time to make a stand
To reclaim our lives
Because only steel can set us free
Rise my brothers, we are blessed by steel
In my sword I trust!
Arm yourselves, the truth shall be revealed
In my sword I trust!
Tyrants and cowards for metal you will kneel
In my sword I trust
'Til justice and reason will wield
In my sword I trust
The sword that shimmers in my hand,
Do you have the mind to eat the guilty flesh?
To drink the blood of those who are to blame?
The time of change is here, unveil your blade!
Rise my brothers we are blessed by steel
In my sword I trust
Arm yourselves the truth shall be revealed
In my sword I trust
Tyrants and cowards for metal you will kneel
In my sword I trust
'Til justice and reason will wield
In my sword I trust
Cling your souls to your gods
Kneel, obey, follow their laws
Deceit, subjugate, cherish their greed
Disdain verity, glorify futile faith
O Old Man,
Bring me a fiery fur coat
Put on me a blazing shirt
Shielded by which I may make war
Lest my head should come to grief
And my locks should go to waste
In the sport of bright iron
Upon the point of harsh steel
Rise my brothers we are blessed by steel
In my sword I trust
Arm yourselves the truth shall be revealed
In my sword I trust
Tyrants and cowards for metal you will kneel
In my sword I trust
'Til justice and reason will wield
In my sword I trust
In my sword I trust
Unsung Heroes
Forgotten tomb hill
Unnamed graves
No light can reach there
Memories fade away
Only frozen soil
And eternal wind
Remember the sacrifice
Of those who are now buried in time
A Dauntless heart
A Righteous mind
No sign of fear
Cast aside
Left to die
Just one frozen tear
Unsung heroes
Forgotten valour
Unknown soldiers
Entombed in time
Only shadows grow
Where the forsaken lie
Hope buried in snow
A thousand scars
Regret none
But only the dead ones
Have seen the end of war
Burning Leaves
Passing aeons
Everlasting fight against the Evil
Their army grows on and on
With the darkening horizon
I'm not afraid, let them come
I will never retreat
I will stand and hold my ground
Protect the ancient tree
The defense is doomed to fall
With the world I used to know
Burning leaves
Turn to ash before my eyes,
Crushed my dreams long gone.
Burning leaves
Dead branches reach to the sky,
The flame within me is gone.
On the light of the last dying star
Serpents crawl closer
All five branches, cursed from the start
And roots are torn to pieces
Right before my dying breath
I lay my eyes to the sky
As an eagle spreads its wings for the last time
Leaving me, the oak, the grove, to die
Burning leaves
Turn to ash before my eyes,
Crushed my dreams long gone.
Burning leaves
Dead branches reach to the sky,
The flame within me is gone.
Liekö enää päällä maan
Ainuttakaan joka muistaa
Lehdon tuon kauniin kaukaisen
Jonne tie vie jokainen
Kun kuolemaan vartija viimeinen
Keskellä liekkien ikuinen
Puu ja maailma ihmisten
Niin loppuu aikamme
I wonder if any longer someone walks the Earth who recalls
That fair Grove afar, where all paths meet
As the last of the guardians falls, ablaze the
Eternal Tree and Domain of Man
Thus ends Our Time
Celestial Bond
A long time ago I went to the shore
I whispered my wish to a breeze from the North
The wind took the wish high to the stars
Told them what I've missed with all my heart
I was mesmerized by the rolling tide
I lay on that shore and gazed into the skies
Like a shooting star, my dream was gone
I made up my mind
I don't want to wake up
When will time heal and fulfil the dream of my heart?
When will we unite as one and light our own star?
All these memories I will treasure in my heart
Words are so vain
A bond beyond quintessence
For a thousand lifetimes
I will wait to feel
A passing moment of bliss
To be embraced by silence
Retribution Shall Be Mine
No sun rises today
No moon shares it's light
Eclipse of soul
Growing breach of faith
Pierced by bitter deception
Chained to the darkness
Left to rot
Growing breach of faith
Left to rot with hate
I can't escape from this living hell
But in my dreams the justice dwells
Betrayers are torn apart
And my hate will fade away with their blood
My hate runs deep
In the waters of grudge and unforgiveness
Leniency is for the weak
I'd rather die than show you mercy
Slaughter is yet to come
Retribution shall be mine!
Oh Gods of vengeance, fill my heart!
This is mine
The one and final fight
I choose not to die
With these demons by my side
Star Queen (Celestial Bond Part II)
The traveller's heart is meant to be free
No obligations and soul redeemed
I knew that part wasn't for me
When I met my star queen
Born in stars, like all of us
But can two paths start from one?
Unite again somewhere in time
And light the brightest star in the endless sky
Oh Queen of Stars
How long until
Oh Queen of Stars
Dreams are fulfilled?
Years go by I thought I could forget
I lived in a lie, that's all I regret
It's better for a man to die by the sword
Than wither away with undying love
I wish that the wind will play with her hair
Touch her lips, tell I'll be there
Longing for the moment for eternity
Light of a thousand stars will always comfort me
Last Breath
Lying on the ground
As battle rages on
Warm blood covers
The cold land of our fathers
Don't cry for me my son
Because I'm not the only one
Where I go you can't follow
This journey I will make all alone
I've bled so many times for this land
But this wound will claim my life
Death commands me to give my hand
Let not my people
Live under oppression
And remember the darker the night
The more beautiful is the morning's light
Fear no more
Just let go
Adore this world
Once more
The truth unfolds
In the Ancient Halls
Fear no more
Just let go
There is no shimmer of the light
In this pouring rain
I close my eyes
Has it all been in vain?
Passion, Proof, Power
Where to find the truth?
Questions linger through time
Unbreakable will and inquiring mind
Have always been the seeker's guide
The Reason as my sword
The Knowledge as my shield
I'll face my foes again and again
On the ancient battlefield
I can't deny what I've seen
So towards the great unknown
I must keep going on
Stop your quest
Or with fire you'll be cleansed
Confess...
Death...
Woe to the faith
Through dark centuries
The wait for the time
When all is revealed
Unbreakable
Stands through time
Dwells the proof of life
Eternal Earth of mine
Cleanse our souls
No good thoughts shall burn
Engulf the passion of life
Eternal Fire of mine
Carry it on
The ancient wisdom of mankind
Eternal Air of mine
Renew us within
Wash away
The remains of lies
Eternal Water of mine
Indivisible
Beyond death and life
The answer divine
Eternal Elements of mine
The gatekeeper of the knowledge
The One who was trusted the secrets of time and space once said:
To know is your destination
To find is your possibility
And to search is your quest.
Your path has merged with the truth.
But yet you refuse to see it
It's easier to be afraid, to be deceived, to be a sheep
Be aware, question them, question yourself
Because once you see it, you can never look away
Every man's
Horizon can change
But eternal skies
Will always stay the same
Like a new sun arises from winter's cold and dark grave, it's unstoppable.
Keep your twisted beliefs
Sons and Daughters of Dawn are calling me
The fire that burns my flesh
Shall light up the words I've said
The curse on my innocent name
Shall put all of you in shame
Woe to the man
Who disheartens the few
Who reach for the light
Who searches for the truth
I only have just one more wish
That this torch will be passed onto someone sentient like you
When your time comes, don't lose your heart
Have faith and patience and trust in the flame before passing it onto someone new
The greatest power of all
Will force their gods to fall
The greatest power of all
Embrace, illuminate all!
I am, you are, no one's slave
No man or god they have made
Ad Victoriam
Blood Is The Price Of Glory
Before the grimmest enemy
Cold rain whipping those proud faces
Warcries raising their spirits
Despising death as they rush forward
Blood of the brothers drains to the ground
Stirring up rage, giving the power
Trampling the enemy with their feet
Without fear they fight
Can you hear the call of the North star
Feel its longing in your heart
This bound is eternal
Sworn through blood
At the end we will stand as one!
Even if the daylight dies
Our horde marches on and on
If we should fall down to the ground
We'll rise again and never give up!
But for some it's all too much
This honorable battle and bloodshed
They flee like a swarm of craven rats
Leaving their brothers to a certain death
The last furious men
They didn't fear death or pain
They held up their swords and shields
As winners they stood on the battlefield
Can you hear the call of the North star
Feel its longing in your heart
This bound is eternal
Sworn through blood
At the end we will stand as one!
Even if the daylight dies
Our horde marches on and on
If we should fall down to the ground
We'll rise again and never give up!
Run away you cowards
We turn our backs on you
The shame that now stains your name
Will only brighten our glory
Those who fight till their last breath
And fall with honour
Their names and deeds shall live forever
Never to be forgotten
No axe stayed in your weak hand
No shield protected you from the blows of enemies
Get out of our sight
The war has no need for traitors
Can you hear the call of the North star
Feel its longing in your heart
This bound is eternal
Sworn through blood
At the end we will stand as one!
Even if the daylight dies
Our horde marches on and on
If we should fall down to the ground
We'll rise again and never give up!
Deathbringer From The Sky
High above the ground
Beyond the thunderclouds
A Black shade is flying alone
Once so feared among men
Now the legend is becoming too old
But finally the horrifying truth is about to unfold
Deathbringer from the Sky
Hunting victims in the night
Feel the terror as flames are burning bright
There is... No tower as high or a cave so deep
That can save you from its endless spite
So bow down and face your wretched destiny
A Den filled with treasures and gold
No longer calms his spirit so cold
Again it is time to spread the wings of doom
A Growl shakes the ground
Flames blind men and smoke covers the stars
As he rises towards an ancient sky
The era of total chaos will arrive
Men shall flee in fear
My name will haunt their mortal souls
I'll burn their flesh and I'll crush their bones
Now they shall know
That every myth told is true
They shall burn on my blazing gallows
Deathbringer from the Sky
Hunting victims in the night
Feel the terror as flames are burning bright
There is... No tower as high or a cave so deep
That can save you from its endless spite
So bow down and face your wretched destiny
Your screams can't make me feel pity or regret
I only feel furious hatred
With fire my dominion is gained
So burn away and let my kind rule the world again
Ahti
At the time of sundown
Nature bathes in colours
In silence it waits
For the approaching force
In the halls of Ainola
The true king of dark waters
Lurks with his mistress
And a mob of a sea creatures
Under the waves of a blue lake
Dwells the mighty AHTI!
Sailors praise the glorious name
Of the ruler of tides AHTI!
At the shores of a northern land
Pray mortal men
Destruction for the arrogant fools
A Reward for humble souls
The great lurker of the seas
Is pleased of the sacrifice
The waters are calm
Today no storm shall rise!
Under the waves of a blue lake
Dwells the mighty AHTI!
Sailors praise the glorious name
Of the ruler of tides AHTI!
Under the waves of a blue lake
Dwells the mighty AHTI!
Sailors praise the glorious name
Of the ruler of tides AHTI!
Foreign ship filled with infidels
They didn't listen to the northern men
From a dead calm storm will rise
And they'll face the wrath of the sea
Take care that your heir
Don't turn out too proud
Or your bloodline will drown
Into a vast ocean...
Under the waves of a blue lake
Dwells the mighty AHTI!
Sailors praise the glorious name
Of the ruler of tides AHTI!
Under the waves of a blue lake
Dwells the mighty AHTI!
Sailors praise the glorious name
Of the ruler of tides AHTI!
One More Magic Potion
Once when we were returning from a battle and
We got lost in a gloomy forest
in the middle of the woods
we saw an old house
with tired minds we knocked
the door very loudly
Old woman opened the wooden door
She asked us to come in
with kind words
From her pot arose a scent so weird
Stunning and bitter but very summoning
Bring me a magic potion
it will heal my aching wounds
A taste so bitter that makes
my bleeding soul feel so good
It will make us sing and dance
in our endless feast
Or it might even unleash
the beast in me
She filled out pints with that devils beverage
And served another round with an hideous grin
The world was spinning in a new light I saw everything
and everyone was singing this song
With nature, trolls and the spirits of the forest
We are one let our singing rise up into the stars
The witch's magic drum was still beating hard
When a goblin brought me a new pint and together we roared
Drink and dance!
People of the forest sing with us!
Who wants to brawl with me?
Who can shape a kantele from a pike's jaw?
Like the great one once did
Close your eyes
Calm your mind and drift away from the pain
Beyond dreams
Into the depths of the cauldron
Like a rain it falls
And mirrors nature's healing powers
Surrender this time
And relief you shall find
Catcher of souls
hunter of spirits
Grant us the final frop of the life's elixir
I want to drown all my misery
Into the green trolls blood
And brown swamp drink
Fight against diminishing time
Burden of a solitary warrior's life
Catcher of souls
hunter of spirits
Grant us the final frop of the life's elixir
Bring me a magic potion
it will heal my aching wounds
A taste so bitter that makes
my bleeding soul feel so good
It will make us sing and dance
in our endless feast
Or it might even unleash
the beast in me
Wanderer
In time bleeding wounds will heal
Unlike some which are too deep to see
Like scars in a nomads soul
Their mending is so slow
Not the shout of a hundred enemies
Can make him feel fear inside him
But when sun sets and the cold arrives
With crushing solitude in the darkness of night
He will ride across land and time
To find a way through this endless night
There's a storm in his heart and the fire burns his soul
But the wanderer's part is to ride alone
With bare hands he has taken many lives
He has had a hundred women by his side
From enchanted woods to the freezing north
He is known at every sea and far beyond
As the moon grows and the circle is complete
He lies down and waits for sleep
But there's always a scenery in his mind
Of all that beauty he once left behind
He will ride across land and time
To find a way through this endless night
There's a storm in his heart and the fire burns his soul
But the wanderer's part is to ride alone
He will ride across land and time
To find a way through this endless night
There's a storm in his heart and the fire burns his soul
But the wanderer's part is to ride alone
He will ride across land and time
To find a way through this endless night
There's a storm in his heart and the fire burns his soul
But the wanderer's part is to ride alone
Raised By The Swords
Oh, who is raised by the sword

Who is toughened by the fire
Can't be burned
Awaited by immortality
Are the ones sacrificing their lives
To blood, to victory, to the truth

We will turn your fields into death
Shining our blades smash all down
Guidance of cold winds
We complete the ancient rule
Each of us was created to kill
Hail, the wisest ones

Shining our blades smash all down
Guidance of cold winds
We complete the ancient rule
Each of us was created to kill
Oh, raise the wind
Oh, open up earth
Oh, wild waters flood
And flames burn the ruins they own
Burn all and everything they own

Have raised to get their victory
You depend on our mercy
Who is raised by the sword
Can't be beaten
Who is toughened by the fire
Can't be burned
Our everlasting loyalty will never break
The bold people of war
Have raised their swords
The New Dawn
Through the storm like the wind we ride
Leaving it all far behind
Another war is straight ahead
This fight will give us all
None shall live , they all will fall
When the new dawn arises, we stand tall
Fight! For our new dawn
Ride! Kill them all
Fight! For our new dawn
Rise! And we stand tall
Feel your strength and let it rise
Hear the call of their demise
Let them feel your steel
Have faith my friend, this is not the end
Our time is near, we feel your fear
Because we will...
Fight! For our new dawn
Ride! Kill them all
Fight! For our new dawn
Rise! And we stand tall
Nothing can stop us now
As we march towards the final fight
It waits us in the night
Our swords are taking lives
Giving us what is ours
Now the new dawn arises and we have it all
Fight! For our new dawn
Ride! Kill them all
Fight! For our new dawn
Rise! And we stand tall
Victory Song
The plan of invasion
an Evil deception
Was made in the halls of the dark kingdom
To steal their riches
To slave them all
To make them kneel for a new God
The Guard woke up the sleeping men
With the sound of a bronze horn
The enemy is getting closer
So brace yourselves for assault!
Swords in their hands they killed each and every man
Who dared to invade their sacred land
Victory songs are raising in the night
Telling all of their undying strength and might
Arrows are raining from the sky
As brothers fight side by side
We're outnumbered
But our destiny is to win
FIGHT!
Fight with the rage of a bear!
DEFEND!
Our homeland!
CRUSH!
Crush every enemy!
AND SEAL!
Our victory!
Swords in their hands they killed each and every man
Who dared to invade their sacred land
Victory songs are raising in the night
Telling all of their undying strength and might
The braves of the north
Didn't give in before the threat
Again the sky dome rumbles
Blood stains the snow
Many don't get to see tomorrow
Many will be missed
Land remains peaceful for progeny
Songs of victory will sound forever)
Swords in their hands they killed each and every man
Who dared to invade their sacred land
Victory songs are raising in the night
Telling all of their undying strength and might
Swords in their hands they killed each and every man
Who dared to invade their sacred land
Victory songs are raising in the night
Telling all of their undying strength and might
Lady In Black
She came to me one morning
One lonely Sunday morning
Her long hair flowing
In the midwinter wind
I know not how she found me
For in darkness I was walking
And destruction lay around me
From a fight I could not win
Ah ah ah...
She asked me name my foe then
I said the need within some men
To fight and kill their brothers
Without thought of love or God
And I begged her give me horses
To trample down my enemy
So eager was my passion
To devour this waste of life
Ah ah ah...
But she wouldn't think of battle that
Reduces men to animals
So easy to begin
And yet impossible to end
For she's the mother of all men
Had counselled me so wisely then
I feared to walk alone again
And asked if she would stay
Ah ah ah...
Oh lady lend your hand I cried
And let me rest here at your side
Have faith and trust
In me she said
And filled my heart with life
There is no strength in numbers
Have no such misconception
But when you need me
Be assured I won't be far away
Ah ah ah...
Thus having spoke she turned away
And though I found no words to say
I stood and watched until I saw
Her black cloak disappear
My labor is no easier
But now I know I'm not alone
I find new heart each time
I think upon that windy day
And if one day she comes to you
Drink deeply from her words so wise
Take courage from her
As your prize
And say hello from me
Ah ah ah...
Dragonheads
Sails up! We're leaving today
Distant lands are calling
Cowards stay at home this is a quest of true men
Farewell, should we never see again
Weeping women waving at the pier
When the sky starts to cry
But neither rain, nor wind can make us turn around
What's decided, has to be done
See how the forefathers greet, us with northern lights
Bravely towards unknown shores, through raging storms we fight
Faith in the gods, their strength in our hearts, when lightning strikes
If we die, we'll meet again in Valhalla...
In a dream I saw two ravens in the sky
And a verdant land behind
When we set out feet there, we'll burn our fleet
'Cause the land is promised to us by gods
May Njord protect us on our way
May the moon light our path
Let our spirits be purified by the ocean's breeze
Let the wind, tell our legend which ever lasts
When we reach the open sea, leaving our home behind
The Dragonheads are rising, let the stars be our guides
See how the forefathers greet, us with northern lights
Bravely towards unknown shores, through raging storms we fight
Faith in the gods, their strength in our hearts, when lightning strikes
If we die the sun will shine again beyond mortal time
We'll meet again in Valhalla!
Warrior's Quest
Strike with powers of magic stone
Grab your legacy that you behold
If you can find your destiny
Then you may return back to your home
...Ride away with your mighty horse
Ride away through the land of storms...
Unknown are the ways of your journey ahead
But with strength and courage you can avoid your death
Throw your sword through the memories
Embracing your bleeding heart
Don't follow the shadows they ain't for real
Like the guiding stars
As he falls to eternity the truth is fading
Part of him died long time ago but still there's death awaiting
Go now brave warrior don't look back
The stars will guide you through the night
But even the brightest light,
Won't reach into the darkest night...
Kalevala Melody
White Storm
On this magical dawn the colours of the autumn are reflected by a light
A light that has been captured for years in oblivion of time
Circles of time are raging now
And so his powers are slowly dying
Before the coldness rapes the lands
His spirit is wandering into the night... to die!
...And he heard chimes ahead playing these enchanted notes,
That lead him into a wooden cabin, where he could rest for the night...
Over the mountains
He had traveled
Across the oceans
Deep in the night
Now when it's time to
Say last farewells
Show us your power
Show us your might
His eyes can see it so clearly now
But his restless mind cannot sense it in the air
The white storm is close!
...And his powers gained in this mystical place more than he ever possessed before.
So now he could rule the realms of ice... Once again!
Over the mountains
He had traveled
Across the oceans
Deep in the night
Now when it's time to
Say last farewells
Show us your power
Gift from the sky
Into Hiding
The islander slips into hiding
And takes to his heels
Out of dark Northland
The murky house of Sara
He whirled out of doors as snow
Arrives as smoke in the yard
To flee from bad deeds
There he had to become someone else
He must change his shape
As an eagle he swept up
Wanted to soar heavenward
The sun burnt his cheeks
The moon lit his brows
The tree is blooming on the fields of Karelia
The Karelian birches are getting thicker
Your cockoo is cockooing and it is spring
Take my endless yearning there.
I feel your danger and your' mountain range.
and the smoke of your burnt land and your sleeping nights
and the primeval trees of your forest
and your looming inlets and the mounths of the fjords.
My journey is oft there without a goal
through forests went, bushes
I stood with a bare head on the hills
where I saw the beautiful Karelia ahead of me
Hello, forest, hello, mountain
Hello, the prince of the forest
Here is a noble boy, young
He comes forward, full of power
as the severe wind of the field
I want to be a son of the forest
hero of the gloomy spruce copse
on the fields of Tapiola
I wrestle with the bear
And the world shall be forgotten
The peace is here wonderful
Brave is the fighting
Storm is coming and forest thunders
The fire strikes long
and a spruce falls down loudly
March Of War
Axe Of Judgment
Patience is a virtue when you live for revenge
Hide your weapons, veil your hate, seek your foes unguarded and slay them!
Slay them!
Behead them!
Oh sweet revenge!
Behold, the axe of judgement falls!
This is war!
So make them suffer!
I share no thought for the dark depths where fate made me dwell
My hate has shaped me to perfection
A ruthless executioner
Remember this hate
Was the only thought in my head
When I woke up wounded on the ground
Stabbed in the back
A coward's attack
Curse you!
This means war!
If I would believe in soul
I would slaughter yours
But fear and agony in your eyes
Will have to do
When the axe of judgement falls
The vindictive one stands tall
Heathen Horde
Too many times has moon travelled across the sky,
Since our fathers sailed out for glory and honour,
It's time to fulfill the vow once given,
Forge your plows to swords, send the word,
Raise an army countless as stars in the sky.
All heathen hearts,
Answer the call,
God of thunder bless our swords,
Our heathen horde,
Will never fall,
We are hungry for blood, steel and war.
Filled with strength, valour, determination,
Determined to conquer the land,
There is no power,
In their weak invocation,
Puny invocations to their feeble god,
Desecrate and drown it in their blood.
"A coward believes he will ever live
If he keep him safe from strife:
But old age leaves him not long in peace
Though spears may spare his life.
Row!
Storm is getting near,
Row!
I can see land ahead,
No!
Show no mercy for the weak,
Gold, land and women are ours to take so kill!
One Man Army
This lifeless soil
Barren of good thoughts
Scorched by grudge and grief
Doomed to linger on
Wandered aimlessly
Blinded by their lies
Now I raise my head and sword
When shadows steal the light
Fire
Desire
Denial
Burning
Yearning
Discerning
Fire
Desire
Denial
In my heart
Burning
Yearning
Discerning
I see it now
You call it cruelty
I call it strength
I am cursed to be
A one man army
You call me inhumane
I call this life regained
I am blessed to be
A one man army
I will take the lives, lives of my enemies
Yet still this battle feels like a defeat to me
Death or victory, only emptiness I feel
The spring of hope runs dry
Because I'm already dead inside
I will take the lives, lives of my enemies
Yet still this battle feels like a defeat to me
Death or victory
Fire
Desire
Denial
Burning
Yearning
Discerning
Fire
Desire
Denial
In my heart
Burning
Yearning
Discerning
I see it now
You call it cruelty
I call it strength
I am cursed to be
A one man army
You call me inhumane
I call this life regained
I am blessed to be
A one man army
One man army
Burden Of The Fallen
Nightmares return again.
There's no way to make amends.
His heart and the battlefield
Are alike, silent and empty.
Warrior Without A War
Only change is unavoidable,
A brave new chapter is getting closer ,
Without a shroud of doubt he walked
The road so long. One dream, now gone.
What are you more afraid to find:
Something to live or something to die for?
In the end, how will you fall:
As a hero or a warrior without a war?
Why you withhold the pain but need those scars?
How will you leave to the unknown shores?
As a hero or a warrior without a war?
As a hero or a warrior without a war?
The one who is now forgotten
Carries the weight of a mountain.
No one can see how solemn
Is the burden of the fallen.
Memories, ruthless like old guilt.
Choices, accept or be haunted .
No past, no future means a thing.
The very moment is all there is.
What are you more afraid to find:
Something to live or something to die for?
In the end, how will you fall:
As a hero or a warrior without a war?
As a hero or a warrior without a war?
Is it courage to let go or drown with a sword?
How will you face your final dawn?
As a hero or a warrior without a war?
The one who is now forgotten
Carries the weight of a mountain.
No one can see how solemn
Is the burden of the fallen.
Cry For The Earth Bounds
The cry for the earth bounds
Who'll face the final sundown
On the last shore of this dying world
A man, a symbol, a sword
A vague memory of something that was
But the moment takes its grasp
Horizon so calm
Harbinger of doom
Sets the sky ablaze
Torn apart by the whirl of time
Slowly, grimly all is devoured by night
Through the night we ride
Till the edge of time
Comforting death
Under the crumbling sky
Your fights
Are over now
Lay down and sleep
Gone are
All hate and love
For eternity
No eyes to see
When the last light that dwindles
Fades to nothingness
No souls to save
In the endless darkness
No hope, no forgiveness
Two Of Spades
I go all the way
Night and day
Women, booze and money
It's all just a game
Hit and run
That's how I play
All or nothing
That's the winner's way
When I woke up this morning
Everything was clear
Besides my head
Who's the lady in my bed?
I'll shoot the moon
Nice girls won't tell
Thanks for nothing
I'll be on my way to hell
Sweet lady luck on my side
I got ace in the sleeve
Dead man's hand
I'm armed to my teeth
There is no trick in the book
That I wouldn't know
Cross me and feel
The embrace of the rope
I'm a high roller
Gambling my life every single day
I'm not a poser
Because the card of my life is two of spades
"If I may die today,
To my ancestors, beyond time
In front of me stands the gates of Valhalla
In my hand well played cards of life."]
My Ancestors' Blood (Heathen Throne Part III)
Not just for victory,
Not just to crush your enemy,
Not just for heir to be,
But for this moment and to fight the injustice...
It was written long ago,
This is what I've been told,
An army came across the sea
To conquer this low land.
They lured with their lies,
Shouted, "Peasant, kneel or die!"
Outnumbered, undaunted,
War cry rose to the skies.
On the homeland of the raven,
Where the eagles scream at daybreak,
And the clang and clash of armies,
Beautiful the strife for conquest.
Rains came over to the north,
Flood of lies to drown the old gods,
A storm rose within the hearts of the enslaved,
Ode for my ancestors' blood.
The seer foresaw the curse from above,
Like a roar of approaching giant horde,
In the moors and in the marshes,
On the borders of the woodlands,
They marched like approaching giant horde.
When I yield my life forever,
Bravely will I fall in battle,
Fall upon the field of glory,
Beautiful to die in armour.
Descendants, Defiance, Domination
The darkest hour, the hopeless time
Is always before the rise of the dawn
Find your courage to stand against a stream
The fairest they speak when the falsest they think
When mouths of men speak the words of gods
The truth will never be enough for anyone
When you reach the peak of the highest mountain
Proudly plant the flag of the heathen defiance
From the ashes of the ancient blood and wisdom
The children of thunder will rise again
Wielded lashes, pyres aflame, gloomy gallows
Tormented ones, brave and free
Screams echo in time
Not one unjust deed goes unpunished
No blood is shed in vain under the reborn thunder sign
I know we will
Claim the throne and kill
They asked for war so we will give them one
The one to end it all
Reckoning with blood
Stop the madness that's gone on for centuries
In a storm of obloquy, my sons stand strong
Marshall the forces, gather up weapons for the last war to come
Who is so righteous, uncorrupted to condemn and dominate
With truth and not with illusions
Not driven by the greed to be enthroned and rule?
Havoc no more
The reign of man
I have seen
How moon and stars glimmer
Over the waves far away
Sometimes wanderer may forget
How home land keeps on waiting
The one who is returning from far away
With the wings of longing
I fly across a distant land
To where my heart always desires to return
In front of storm clouds
In front of battles of life
In my heart I'll always be
Lady of the North
When I left
Tears of sorrow didn't flow
When I came back
I saw that something had changed
The path of a drifter
Wasn't real
But only longing and dreams
Candour And Lies
I, I have sailed
All alone
So many times
The seven seas of tears
I can still hear the waves.
Cold frigid wind
On my sails
Always takes me back
To distant memories
Home, the last farewell.
Waves of time
Candour and lies
for what I left behind,
I know the price was high.
No tears to cry
No words to make it right
But now I know that home is
Where my heart desires.
I, I was lost
No star
No shore to call my own
But I didn't know
I had it all.
On the fields of victories
And defeats
A drifter's life is both
longing and dreams
then reality.
Wasted time,
Candour and lies,
For what I left behind,
I know the price was high.
No tears to cry,
No words to make it right,
But now I know that home is
Where my heart desires.
Behold how travels the wind
Hear how runs the time
Beneath the eternal star dotted sky
Will grow a vast power
In the glow of northern lights
Rises the sword of the victor
For Those About To Fight For Metal
Outnumbered but never alone, we stand
Brave warriors, axes in our hands
The symbol of enlightenment
The secret of steel
Carved in the hearts of the free
Forged in eternal fire
Harden in the frozen rain
There is something stronger than mortal flesh
That unites us as one
For those about to fight for metal
Gods of war salute you all
For those who'll never lower their blade
We're blood brothers 'til the end
The sound of archaic battle horns
Releases the beast within us all
Join us to fight for the metal dawn
Or one by one, you will fall
Let me hear your battle cry!
Raise your swords up high!
Way Of The Warrior
Staring into dying flames
Moon as my only guard
It's too late to hesitate
Only the weak suffer in this life
It's the way of the warrior
This path before me
Destined to be the king
Of battlefields
It's the eve of the bloodshed:
Women and mead!
From the skulls of my foes
Tomorrow, I'll drink
I shall honour my blade
With deeds, not with hollow words
Men will kneel when they hear my name
Before I laugh and rip out their wretched hearts
There are warriors with broadswords
Heroes clad in mail of copper
Are on beer intoxicated
By the beer are much embittered
Two Paths
Callow dreams
Dawn of spring
No seeds of doubt yet sown in the ground
Man-made shades mould reality
Looming deceptions
Hope blurs it all
The path so bright
The path so dark
All crossroads
Illusions of our lives
No, feel no pity for a dying man
We're all just here to die, to live one precious life
None for all and all for none
It's the only law
Feed you inner wolves
With prudence
When the night closes in
It grants us the final wish
The blade may be rusty and dull
But the spirit will never bend
Unforgiving, benevolent, brave, noble and foolish
All will dim with the last exhale
Then all will be complete
Every deed has a price to pay
May sagacity and chaos bless your way
King Of Storms
Who dares to stare death in the eye?
And face the maelstrom of doom like a hero?
When light splits the sky
And like a thousand giants, thunder roars
King of storms
Descends from the skies
Before my eyes
Destroyer of worlds
King of storms
I will rule with fear and pain
Your world will burn in dragon flame
You will
Obey
Your kin
Will yield when I say
Your dreams
Your fears
Your dying screams
Belong to me
Descry the beast of the nightmare realm
Destruction of all, humanity abhorred
Ravaged land where the afflicted dwell
The frozen void entombs idle prayers and exhorts
Feast With Valkyries
Through mist we ride
Howling wolves in moonlight
Blood has been shed tonight
It's judgement time
Gallantly you fought
Made your people proud
Rise brave warriors
The journey has just begun
High to the skies
Across the seas,
Woods of the north
And mountain peaks
The song will sound
Through history
Tonight we'll feast with Valkyries
Sons of frost and steel, reinvigorate
Stay humble not brash
Because I'm the one who chooses the slain
North wind in my hair
Only me, my steed and my spear
Charge to another battlefield
Eternal chant in the air
Don't You Say
From town to town I roam and dwell
Sing my songs and stories I tell
Gone is the gold and ladies' smile
I'm living on borrowed time
This is me, no guilt, no shame
I ain't no saint, I ain't no king
I'm a man of my word
With a stone backbone
Open your arms
I'm coming home
Don't you say it's the same old story
Don't you say I came too late
Don't you say it was all for nothing
For now I am here to stay
This promise will never fade away
I have a will, hard as a rock
But it crumbled down with the very last drop
Don't ask so I don't have to lie
I'm a rover 'til the day I die
I Will Never Kneel
Winds are calling me
The cold breeze of death
From the dividing stream
The clarity of what lies ahead
Your fortune will never change
Is what blind weaklings say
But I will not rest before the day
Every peasant is crowned as his own king
I will never kneel
Before your false beliefs
By my heathen blood
I will not give up
In my chest shines a glimmer as dark as the heart of the night
I will never forgive nor forget
The grudge, haunting, dead weight,
I will never forgive and forget… never
My love, where have you gone?
So cold, what have they done?
I can't see you, the world drowns in tears
I will forgive you, become the righteous hate and never forget
All is lost now, what once was a dream
Will never be seen
Spill their blood, revenge for both of us
And for all that will never be…
God Is Dead
Bring out your dead
I shout again
Will this ever end?
Rotting corpses everywhere
But I knew how to transcend
Round and round, the bottle goes
Drown, drown all hope and sorrow
Mad men on the streets
Keep herding their sheep
High or low, we're all gonna go
Down at least for six feet
Like thunder in a pint
Divine truth I will find
Lifelong misery
It is not out destiny
Joy to the world, god is dead
So let's drink until the bitter end
They whip you with their made-up sins
They beat you until you finally give in
But know that there is another path
Filled with joy and not the grandeur of misery
Wake up and see
Drink with me
In our wanton harmony
Hail To The Victor
Scareless man
Mangled soul of a solitary
Some fights
That are fought in the mind are not imaginary
Blazing eyes
Although the road has been long
All chains
Ignorance and hate…no more
Time is the dividend on ephemeral paths
Longing of the fulfillment is carved in wolven hearts
All those, in the end, will merge in to one
These times
These lives
In the hands of beasts of lies
Man made gods
Turning tides
Unknown future, no hope in sight
Foul beings
The ultimate sin
Like fools, they charge to kill their kin
The legend tells
In the hearts of men
Is the way, the power, to rise above this hell
Hail to the victor!
Once a castaway
But never astray
In the mirror we'll see the face
Of the only god whom should be praised
