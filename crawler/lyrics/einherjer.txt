Dragons Of The North
As blood for wolves and riches for lust
Onwards with hammers to chest
Villages burn, burn cities to dust
And for fun they torture the rest
Cold blue steel through a nice lady's breast
An avalanche of heathens set sail
To show to the world which men is best
To conquer where others would fail
Dragons of the North
Dragons of the North
Odin is working to eagerly form
A great heathen fist from north
Pray for your life when there's signs of a storm
But praying won't help when the dragons come forth
Roaming the bow, the berserkers, the fierce
They know not fear or pain
Women and children are swimming in tears
While the berserkers are going insane
Dragons of the North
Dragons of the North
Scholared embodied by blood on the mound
The clink of sword sound death chord
Bear slough and wolf slough are shaking the ground
Embraced by might the great northern horde
Odin, great warlord I greet you with hail
This new god is weaker of class
Grant me thy powers, your secrets unveil
And I'll kick this Christ right in the ass
Dragons of the North
Dragons of the North
Dreamstorm
For ages I have drifted, through storms and mists of grey
With knowledge I've been gifted, and paths to lead my way
Alone in realms of chaos, my solitude I seek
I poison therefore my arrow, and aim it at the weak
Come my winds – my dream storm
Soon I shall forever sleep
Pale I have become
Who shall for my fading weep
For faded I have done
Silently I welcome, the glorious mist of dreams
Time to send the heroes home, their end justify my means
Dawn of death, tears of chaos, echoes in my mind
It pleases me, I am satisfied
Closing in on death's desire, though I am not alone
With me comes my fear and fire, and a destiny unknown
My twilight affects me, drifting still in dreams
A gate opens in front of me, weary visions floats in streams
Come my winds – my dream storm
Soon I shall forever sleep
Pale I have become
Who shall for my fading weep
For faded I have done
The Forever Empire
I still dream of paradise
I still wake up crying
I've seen the sun, of tomorrow rise
I felt like I was dying
I still dream of forever
I still see me wave
From the deepest pits of never
Another soul to save
I still long for the sun to rise
I still fear the dark
I've seen the signs of our last goodbyes
Another submerging ark
In bitterness I've tasted my tears
A burnt out soul of emptiness
In loneliness I've touched my fears
And closed my eyes for hopelessness
Sail the waves of lunacy
Bring my presence out of never
The forever waves of time to be
I set my sails for forever
Sail the waves of the silent sea
In empty winds under rainbow's fire
The forever winds won't let me be
Wake me up from my forever empire
I am my paradise
Through my damnation you'll fall
I am the wise
In my eternity I am all
You ask of me my sanity
Divided you shall fall
Your soul shall burn most certainly
Below me you will crawl
I am my own eternity
My creations will not fail
Dream or not it's real to me
Your becoming I prevail
From my fists burns my fire
The emperor of my empire
But there will be a better day
Even I am doomed to fade away
Sail the waves of lunacy
Bring my presence out of never
The forever waves of my time to be
I set my sails for forever
Sail the waves of the silent sea
In empty winds under rainbow's fire
The forever winds has left me
I am fading through the stars, my desire
The Conquerer
Waiting for the morning
For the sun to climb the mountains
For the wind and the waves to answer my call
My sword lies beside me
My ship lies ashore
But few will stand to fight by my side
The snow is slowly falling
And gently caress my skin
Where the steel ripped my flesh
My quest is now ended
My home for me awaits
Where she prays for my return
When the winds are calling me
I raise my sword with pride
Full of hate and agony
Through the storms I ride
Fear is not yet known to me
Fight me and you'll see
The viking blood is strong in me
The conqueror I'll be
Rans web is avoided
Tall mountains salute me
Home is home again to me
I know by now
What matters to me
And those involved knows too
Thunderstorms are raging
Across the churning sea
Towards the northern sky
Awaits the northern stars
The four winds are gathered
Legions of pride awaits me
As I hail the land of frost
The Fimbul Winter
On the other side we'll stand
We're the strong
In another world we'll meet
You'll be the suffering one
On the other side we'll fight
With swords of steel
In another world we'll win
You'll worship us and kneel
You'll be the suffering one
On the other side we'll fight
With swords of steel
Then a storm shall arise
Turning the skies black
Send up a howling wind
Across the churning sea
That's just the beginning of
What awaits us all
The next three years shall be
Without summer or joy to man
The sign shall be the blazing sky
The sign shall be the grimmest cold
The sign shall be the freezing winds of frost
The sign shall be the Fimbul winter
On the other side you'll meet
Blades of steel
In another world you'll meet
Axes swung by hatred strong
On the other side you'll fight
The gods allied
In another world you'll fall
Our wrath will find you all
Axes swung by hatred strong
On the other side you'll fight
The gods allied
With fire and frost
We'll tear your limbs apart
With hammers and swords
We'll crush your warriors
With wisdom and strength
We'll conquer your troops
With hunger and pain
You will remember us
Bright shall shine the sun divine
And unsowed fields shall grow
Trees shall grow and rivers flow
Through woods as green as man
Has ever seen
Brighter every day she'll shine
The mother of our lives
Though I don't want to live to see
The day Ragnarok take our lives away
Storms Of The Elder
Awaken thou, one-eyed god,
Rise again from thine slumber!
Give us a touch of the elder strength
Flowing in your veins
And give us again the courage to crush
The embers of the faded ones
A lightning ripped the sky
The signs of ancient beliefs enlighten
The inner chambers
Of forbidden knowledge
Oh, rise the storm of the elder
Let again Gungnir fly
Into the chests of Giants,
And release again the power
Of your eight-legged horse
Ride again in front of the Oskorei
And lead fear into hearts of men
Enlighten the path for those of the elder spirit
And guide them into glory
We entered a long gone and forgotten valley
Its habitants' flames of life long gone
Ceased by a dark and ancient plague
In the heart of this forbidden place,
We awakened the spirit of the past,
And we entered the dawn
Of the slumbering one
Odin opened his eye
And looked out into the world
He lifted his arms to the sky
And called for the other gods
And commanded them to awaken
From their ages of slumber
Again they rose from the ground,
For these where still embers
Of the lost faith of them
In the halls of Valhalla
Did you heard how noisily they fight in the Hafrsfjord
The noble-kin king and Kjotvi the rich?
Ships came from east, craving for battle-game
With opened mouths and sculpture on the prow
They were loaded with warriors and white shields
With western lances and celtic 3 swords
Berserkir roared where the fight rose
Ulfhednir howled and shook the iron-weapons
They wanted to defy him, but he taught them to flee
The bold western king, that lives in Utsteinn
Then the fight was awaiting, he threw the sea-horses 5
On the shields he hammered, before Haklang 6 fell
Tired of standing beyond the land of Lufa 7
The stout-neck king 8 took as shield an isle
They cast themselves under the seats, those who were wounded
Put buttocks to the air, stuck the head in the keel
They let shine on their back bright palace-tile 9
Thinking of being wise, when then stones hit them,
The eastern clubs 10 hasted away by Jaeren,
Leaving the Hafrsfjord - thinking about the mead
The Ballad Of The Swords
Across the moor
We Norsemen rode
And scalds to us sung
That days of glory
Soon should be
When swords blood-red were swung
"One-eyed father
Give us the strength
My brave kinsmen and I
In Valhalla I
Your mighty men will meet
If in this battle I die
From the sky
Your ravens watching me
Both of them I see
Thank you father
For letting me know
You watch over me."
At the moor
The ravens spoke to me
While scalds did their song
A bitter loss
Was soon to come
For those I were among
Across the moor
We Norsemen rode
And scalds to us sung
That days of glory
Soon should be
When swords blood-red were swung
I say to you I ask you to
For once be your own lord
Come with me
Be part of my
Ballad of the swords
A sudden clash
Where swords were drawn
Was the beginning of my end
With a Norseman's pride
And courage I fought
I would to Hel them send
Instead I felt
Cold chilling steel
Stab me from behind
A cravens deed
Indeed it was
Peace he should not find
Faded I did
Strange beauty I met
The dream for me came true
Brought up I were
Bifrost I saw
My mortal life were through
Your mortal life
With children and wife
Wouldn't have no value
If you knew as I
About life up here
You would die to be here forever
