Still that longing - No more lies
Raging fury - Lonely soul
Foreboding warning - Never whole
I'm cursed and I'm damned forever
Destined to walk this land
I'm cursed and I'm damned forever
Battle is my only friend
Neither wolf nor man
Summer Solstice

Legion
A mighty blast of fire burned across the sky
It is no unknown power causing this tonight
They didn't know I had it in me but I have returned
Transformed, no longer human, watch the heavens burn
You'll pay
They hear the hooves thundering, raising up a storm
He comes with vengeance seething, breaking up the calm
Been called a traitor and a fool so many times
From now on all apposing men will fear the sign
Twisting, turning, riding across the plain
Creating a river of blood, bringer of pain
The god of war, destroyer of all in his reign
Legion's the name called by the toll of bell
Been called a traitor and a fool so many times
From now on all apposing men will fear the sign
Twisting, turning, riding across the plain
Creating a river of blood, bringer of pain
The god of war, destroyer of all in his reign
Legion's the name called by the toll of bell
Never Learned
I have been told
Why I can't grow old

To stay away
When the water churns
Alright

No matter what your gold

I never learned
I've never learned
Never learned
I never learned
Cause I never learned

Never learned

Black Hound Of Vengeance
Got firm belief in what's to come
Your treacherous ways leave me cold and numb
No magic circle will save you now
Your scent's been picked up by my wish to strike
You try to hide behind a veil of smoke
To summon petty demons, will not work
Cause my familiar has searched you out
To make you pay for all the pain I took
You'll learn the way of -

Coat Of Arms
A glade became the setting
Must have been about noon
Grass so green and tender
Ripped apart by steel clad boots
Mid-day's sun reflected
In weapons sharp as steel
Grim determination
One shall die and one shall live
And the dawn became the winner
Sun and moon will rise again
Coat of arms shine and shimmer
A king has been crowned
Now the wounds are open
Blood engulfing all
Ready for the gauntlet
One will stand and one will fall
And the dawn became the winner
Sun and moon will rise again
Coat of arms shine and shimmer
A king has been crowned
And the dawn became the winner
Sun and moon will rise again
Coat of arms shine and shimmer
A king has been crowned
Alright
Generator
Like a lead-heavy generator
Just pushing everything aside
I took my pill and now I feel alright
Like a wheel dead-set on moving
Perpetual bliss in sight
I took my fill and now I feel alright
Oh yeah, I feel alright
Believe me I feel just fine
Oh yeah, I feel alright
Got no restraining shackles
Just a highway stretching far and wide
The sun shines down and feeds me with what I need
There ain't nobody waiting
I'm free to do whatever I please
I've flipped the coin and now I will be seen
Yeah, I will be seen
I'm coming out, I'm coming clean
Oh yeah I will be seen
I will be mean
Emerald, emerald eyes rising from the tomb
No, no quarter in sight, generator of light
Emerald, emerald eyes rising from the tomb
No, no quarter in sight, now you meet your doom
Emerald, emerald eyes prepare for your undoing
No, no quarter in sight, generator of light
Oh come on
Yeah
Wheel Of Time
Wheel of time rotating ever onward
Nothing new and nothing has been learned
The same mistakes still repeated every time
A pleasant ignorance rules the crooked line
Stand back and face your terrible fate
Your soul has been circumscribed
And your body will just wither away
Time to wake from your non-creative slumber
Seasons change but still you stay the same
A crushing blow's going to force your decision
You realize that there is no prize for you
Stand back and face your terrible fate
Your soul has been circumscribed
And your body will wither away
Roll on, wheel of time
Roll on, just crush and grind
Roll on, wheel of time
Roll on, wheel of time!
Yeah
Roll on, wheel of time
Roll on, just crush and grind
Roll on, wheel of time
Roll on, wheel of time!

Sacrifice
The only way to be sure
To rid the land
Of the plague that's been haunting us all
Restoring our faith
In the axe and the sword
Slaves for so long
Our minds filled up with their lies
Now the Christian cross
Forever erased from our eyes
Rejoice all free men
Betrayer, run if you can
Rejoice all free men

Run if you can
Run if you can
Run if you can

Black Hole
All that I want, give me just what I need
What I've been told ain't exactly what I've seen
I'll just lay low here for the time being
Even though I risk falling in that Black Hole
Now that I have seen all that there is in this land
I've proven my worth to my fellow man
I'll just take a backseat to what's going on
Even though I risk falling in that Black Hole
Selling my soul
No remainder for the fools
Losing all control
All that is, is the wind of my soul
In that Black Hole

Mountain Of Power
Sure enough can't figure out
Why all that's good is sin
Why people choose to grovel at
The feet of some dreamed up king
Too scared to fight their own way
So easy to be sheep
Alive but dead inside
Holier than thou
Condemning all around them
They're the chosen ones
Now hypocrisy's king
Defiling everything
And at judgement's hour crumble, yeah
Crumble you mountain of power
Still signs of hope are many
Reason covers ground
Two thousand years of twisted lies
Soon just a burial mound
Too scared to fight their own way
So easy to be sheep
Alive but dead inside
Holier than thou
Condemning all around them
They're the chosen ones
Now hypocrisy's king
Defiling everything
And at judgement's hour crumble, yeah
Crumble you mountain of power
Now hypocrisy's king
Defiling everything
And at judgement's hour crumble, yeah

Leech of power wanting more as you feed - never satisfied
Crowned usurper wasting time and our wealth - you must go
And we'll see him falling now

All false methods you're arrogant and vain - above the law
Your blood is feeble a failing line of heirs - down you go

On Hooves Of Gold
They are masters of defiance - masters of the wind
Let us fly together - let the change begin
Mountains lie below us - the stars are getting near
All doubt has left my being - strength replacing fear
And they said it's too late - but the bastards will pay
As we ride the wind and fly
On hooves of gold we ride
Consuming without feeling - a hollow life of shame
The elders, well of knowledge - discarded, thrown away
New gods taking over - thievery and false pride
Burn the gifts of nature, laugh at the giver of life
With greed raping the land
They don't even know what they demand, no
And they say it's too late - but the bastards will pay
As we ride the wind and fly
On hooves of gold we ride
Ride the wind - change begin
And they say it's too late
But the bastards will pay
As we ride the wind and fly
On hooves of gold we ride
Steel Versus Steel
"I was a thousand times more evil than thou"
Drifting away into dreams of despair
Visions of doom and of dead eyes that stare
Will the end be what you thought - will you escape?
Across the plains you rode as you fled
The lord of chaos put a price on your head
And the black blade at your side won't let you rest
To slay became a trade
Your soul will have to pay
The final fate a clash between the blades
And in the end it's steel versus steel
The final lock and the final key
It's the steel versus steel
A thousand souls won't tame the need
Steel versus steel
The final lock and the final key
Steel versus steel
Skin as white as the full moon at night
Eyes that burn like a red fire light
But the body's still as weak as a newborn child
Tried to rule with mercy inside
Ignore tradition and the dragons will rise
The dreaming city falls - lost in time
To slay became a trade
Your soul will have to pay
The final fate a clash between the blades
'Cause in the end it's steel versus steel
The final lock and the final key
It's the steel versus steel
A thousand souls won't tame the need
Steel versus steel
The final lock and the final key
Steel versus steel
A thousand souls won't tame the need
To slay became a trade
You will travel on the seas of fate
The seas of fate - between the blades
The price to pay - the end of time
The final fate a clash between the blades
And in the end it's steel versus steel
The final lock and the final key
Steel versus steel
A thousand souls won't tame the need
Steel versus steel
The final lock and the final key
Steel versus steel
A thousand souls won't tame the need
It's the steel versus steel
The final lock and the final key - the steel
Fight
They forged an alliance - and legions attend
They steal and conspire - all means to an end
Soon they must fall - we'll rise from our crawl
And summon the strength from within
'Cause we will fight for the right to defend
Fight for the right till the end
Conquer and divide
Fight for the right to survive
Through ages of darkness, slavery and pain
The lie they call "progress" - an expanding domain
Soon they must fall - we'll rise from our crawl
And summon the strength from within
And we will fight for the right to defend
Fight for the right 'til the end
Conquer and divide
Fight for the right to survive
Fight with the power of rage
Fight to the end of our age
With fury burning inside
Fight for the right to survive
For too long did we relent
While they stole at our expense
Now the tide has turned
They must fall
and we will rise standing tall
Fight with the power of rage
Fight to the end of our age
With fury burning inside
Fight for the right to survive
Fight for the right to defend
Fight for the right 'til the end
Conquer and divide
Fight for the right to survive
Triumph And Power
Room to breathe
Fill my need
Give me space
Plant the seed
Born alone
Slowly grown
There's a strength
In my breed
Now my goal
Has been shown
As I march
'Til dawn
For the triumph and the power
Spoils of war
For the hunger and desire
A blood red throne
I ascend to the sky
By the dawn's early light
Fight for glory until death
Hail victory
Will of iron
Quiet soul
Empty words
Empty roles
Break their walls
Break their rules
Fiercely defiant
Damn the fools
Now my goal
Has been shown
As I march
'Til dawn
For the triumph and the power
Spoils of war
For the hunger and desire
A blood red throne
I ascend to the sky
By the dawn's early light
Fight for glory until death
Hail victory
At last there's a reason to believe
To rise from the depths of misery
My heart clad in iron
My soul clad in steel
The triumph and power achieved
As I march
'Til dawn
For the triumph and the power
Spoils of war
For the hunger and desire
A blood red throne
I ascend to the sky
By the dawn's early light
Fight for glory until death
Hail victory
For the triumph and the power
Spoils of war
For the hunger and desire
A blood red throne
I ascend to the sky
By the dawn's early light
Fight for glory until death
Hail victory
Dominator
He made a promise many years ago to break and scorch the land
He had a need for destruction and to bend us to the ground
He swore an oath: To bring us fear and pain
To never bend or rest until it's done - before he had become
The dominator - freedom hater - he will break us, crush our dreams
Amputator - lacerator - spreading madness, mindless hate - dominate
Bringing everlasting pain
So many tragedies and years ago for you to understand
The devastation that he brought will leave a mark until the end
He swore an oath - to bring us fear and pain
To never bend or rest until it's done - before he had become
The dominator - freedom hater - he will break us, crush our dreams
Amputator - lacerator - spreading madness, mindless hate - dominate
He walks alone
He'll put out our fire with scorn
He'll never rest - just enslave us
Destroyer of beasts and of man
Enforcer of madness and pain
He's sworn to break us - the dominator
Born of hate - Crush and break - Annihilate - Dominate
I swore an oath - I will reverse his plan
I will restore - bringing power to the land, but the price is that I am
The dominator - freedom hater - I will bleed you, crush your dreams
Amputator - lacerator - spreading madness, mindless hate - breathing pain
Born of hate - Crush and break - Annihilate – Dominate

Holmgång
You're awaiting your turn, jealousy burns - you know you had your chance
Wanting to lead, filling your greed - envy drives your plans
Stole what I made, all that I saved - never letting up
But in the end there can be only one - and justice will be done
Take your light
Got nowhere to run
Bring the fight
You know the time is now
Steal your life
Got nowhere to run
Take your light
Sun in the back when I attack - there is no return
Beckoning time, I know what is mine - only you will burn
In the light of the day you'll finally pay - this is what you learn
In the end there can be only one - and justice will be done
Take your light
Got nowhere to run
Bring the fight
Justice will be done
Steal your life
Got nowhere to run
Take your light
There can be only one
Take your light
Got nowhere to run
Bring the fight
You know the time is now
Steal your life
Got nowhere to run
Take your light
The Naked And The Dead
In a flash he turned to stone
Hesitated, lost control
Just a man a dying warrior
Battleground drenched in blood
Bodies flayed down in the mud
Mercy never came on this day
For the naked and the dead
There's no glory or reward to be had
If the spirit travels on it's by will power alone
'Cause the body's just a cell of flesh and blood
While the blood seeps to the ground
There are times you realise
How the pain can change your life
Bragging fools will surely pay the price
No set of rules will end the strife
You have to twist and bend in life
The mind is what defines a warrior
For the naked and the dead
There's no glory or reward to be had
If the spirit travels on it's by will power alone
'Cause the body's just a cell of flesh and blood
For the naked and the dead
There's no glory or reward to be had
And if the spirit travels on it's by will power alone
'Cause the body's just a cell of flesh and blood
While the blood seeps to the ground
Only the chosen one will rise

The Hammer Will Bite
The giant arrived, scheming to end Asa rule
Mean as a whip, hard as a rock but a fool
The battle will start at the first light of tomorrow
Jorunheim knew what the thunder would bring
The hammer will bite - no other choice than surrender
Bow to the might - a fiery death from above
The hammer will bite - shattering stone and offenders
Run for your lives - thunder and doom crack the sky
The hammer will bite - you will die
Colossal in size, they built him with magic and clay
Heart from a horse, a fatal mistake for this day
Protector of Asgard never lacked courage
The towering help to the giants will fail
The hammer will bite - no other choice than surrender
Bow to the might - a fiery death from above
The hammer will bite - shattering stone and offenders
Run for your lives - thunder and doom crack the sky
The hammer will bite - you will die
By morning light - the giants die
My death is guaranteed - unless I make him bleed
I can't face him on my own - it's sorcery I need
My help is gone - I'm on my own
My stone is thrown - all is lost
The hammer will bite - no other choice than surrender
Bow to the might - a fiery death from above
The hammer will bite - shattering stone and offenders
Run for your lives - thunder and doom crack the sky
The hammer will bite - you will die
By morning light - the giants die
Like The Oar Strikes The Water
Defile your life with religion
And sell your soul
You put all trust in your holy man
You may deny it's illusion
Just worthless rules
You turn away when you thin you can
Corrupting life with suppression
The safest way
You wash your hands in your piety
The winds have turned in your favour
Your time is here
A congregation on a massive scale
But when the night finally falls
And when the truth finally dawns
Just like the oar strikes the water
But when the night finally falls
Yeah when the truth finally dawns
Just like the oar strikes the water
Fear Is The Key
Hear crushing thunder
Electrifying storm
Winter is calling
Time to hold one's own
Fear is the weapon
To break the cage of man
Control lies inside me
The terror reveals the plan
Unbeliever, unbeliever
The mind will tell me how
Fear is the key
Last of the shadows
Screaming out my name
Strong determination
A guide through searing flame
Blind Beliver
Choose the easy way
Pray for absolution
You know you've gone astray
When blackest depths will face me
Ask no one's help, to break my fall
Born, dead and free forever
I know that fear is the key
Iron Will
Failure - reaching out to greet me
But I will never fall
Aversion - has filled my inner being
But I will never crawl
Obsession - I never fell the pain
Redemption - I will rise again
Again and again
Iron will
I'll never give in or surrender
Iron will
Remind me to always remember
Hatred - it used to feel so easy
Turn away when they call
Craving - driven by the strong need
Alone against them all
Aggression - fuelled by burning hate
Vengeance - I will rise again
Again and again
Iron will
I'll never give in or surrender
Iron will
Remind me to always remember

Silver Into Steel
Time is at hand
Gathering hunger in the night
To feast and to burn
better look for the right of his hands
Summon a feeling of might
Caressed by the dark
The glow of the moon in the eye
Kissing the sweet taste in the air
Embraced by the stars
A home has been found in the end
Time is at hand
Of triumph and sense
A revenge for the times of despair
Silver into Steel
The Shadow Knows
The laugh will be the warning

But will perish in his flame

Beyond Good And Evil
You smile and claim purity of soul
I feel the need to rise above it all
A burning urge will guide me away
Your black and white will lose to the grey
As i walk - beyond good and evil
Your rules betray your need to make a stand
You fight the herd, still need security
There is no true or false in the world
You might be right but I'm not wrong
As i walk - beyond good and evil
beyond good and evil
good and evil
good and evil
beyond good and evil
I Am The North
Joined by the cry of ravens
A chase in the winter cold
First born son of storms
hated and scorned
Free from the cage of morals
Shadow of the ruling kind
The echoes of the savage call
Roll across the land
Truth and lie will join and die
Grey ruler show us how to fight
The Wolf will rise
The end of lies
Corruption dies
Free forever
Burn with the lord of sorrow
Claimed by the shit of nails
Life and death - final breath
Born into the grave
Storm of an ancient fury
Power beyond compare
Serpent's flood - brother's blood
End of times is here
Truth and lie will join and die
Grey ruler show us how to fight
I, The Jury
Damnation - their lies used to lead me away
Feeding my desperate heart - with merciless flames
I soon realized there's nothing to gain
And all the dreams that I had had got lost in my pain
I want to learn - I want to see
I'm gonna learn - gonna see - and I'm gonna turn
Because I'm the Law
Wisdom has sprung - and taken my heart
Nothing will stand in my way - I'll tear them apart
Revelation - no one can lead me astra
Follow my own burning path - away from all slaves
I want to learn - I want to see
I'm gonna learn - gonna see - and I'm gonna turn
Because I'm the Law
Riding the teeth of the wind - all barriers part
I want to learn - I want to see
I'm gonna learn - gonna see - and I'm gonna turn
Because I'm the Law
Hammer Of The North
Black fire
burns in the twilight
The forest glows
Free heart
passion and defiance
pine and hooded crow
Spring eve
glory of the raven
melt the last of the snow
Gold sparks - set the night afire
It's my joy
Hammer of the North
It's late - silver stars shining - a toast to future goals
Black sky - everlasting beauty - brothers by my side
We smile - nature's celebration - we're fierce yet calm
Gold sparks - set the night afire
It's my joy
We'll learn every secret, we'll trample the cross
We'll curse at the giants, we'll laugh as we toss
Hammer of the North
We believe it's our legacy
Masters of our fate - their logic won't dictate
Their gods will fail - then we rise
Hammer of the North
Black Sails
Whipping in the wind
Rule with fear and dreams that tear the light
Sleepless empty nights
A shiver of desperation
Black sails rippling in the wind
Will the dream provide liberation?
Or pain in the end
Haunting dreams of red
Bringing doom - Bringing death
Black sails charge ahead
Rule with dread
Simple life seems hard
Looming shadows
They stalk
A shiver of desperation
Black sails rippling in the wind
Will the dream provide liberation?
Or pain in the end
Haunting dreams of red
Bringing doom - Bringing death
Black sails charge ahead
Rule with dread
The sea turns red
Bringing doom - Bringing death
Black sails charge ahead
Rule with dread
Mountains Be My Throne
I'm coming don to the meeting
There's trouble all around
A final push for the silence
The symbol has been shown
Now if I can't wield the power
I'll find another way
Without your guide, will you make it?
Just sheep that go astray
Rising
Watch me climbing
Far away - where nothing binds me
I'm done with all your fighting
Make it known - let mountains be my throne
Rising
Watch me climbing
Far away - where nothing binds me
I'm done with all your fighting
Make it known - let mountains be my throne
Rising
Watch me climbing
Soaring high, the sun won't bind me
I'm done with all your fighting
Make it known - let mountains be my throne
Northern Star
Living in denial and never seeing straight or clear
Deep down in your senses you feel that fear
Fear of true alliance, nothing worth the fight
No use standing up when wrong rule what's right
When they bring you despair
Don't resort to prayer
Time for fast decisions
Now it's live or die
Strength is summoned from within
Northern star
Banish the false religions
Learn to stand alone
Nothing up above and no one below
Fear of new beginnings
Like a demon in your soul
You must turn your ear to the beckoning call
When they bring you despair
Don't resort to prayer
Time for fast decisions
Now it's live or die
Weakness spreading like a plague
Will you make the change or stay the same and fail
Strength is summoned from within
Northern star
The Lord Of Lies
The lord of lies
He'll steal your life away
And grasp the victor's prize - He's born of fire
He'll claim your soul as pray
The trickster of all time
The lord of lies
Take a deep breath
Watch the forest pull him in
Preparations - Soon the trials will begin
A sacrifice - to make it work he must endure the pain
A conjuring - free the magic, fan the flames again
The lord of lies
He'll steal your life away
And grasp the victor's prize
He's born of fire
He'll claim your soul as pray
The trickster of all time
The lord of lies
Son of giants
Lust and hate is his disguise
Purifier - Naked he'll escape the fires
A sacrifice - to make it work he must endure the pain
A conjuring - free the magic, fan the flames again
The lord of lies
He'll steal your life away
And grasp the victor's prize - He's born of fire
He'll claim your soul as pray
The trickster of all time
The lord of lies
At Midnight They'll Get Wise
The barren land lies empty, no enemies in sight
Though no one ever told them, at midnight they'll get wise
As shadow falls upon them,
no one even dares to speak your name
They'll be given the lesson of their lives
Blood and death will follow
As they get wise
To the lies they believed to be real
And they will pay the price by facing the truth and its deal
When they die
At midnight they'll get wise
A shape of hidden power, a presence of true might
Trust in feral knowledge, their fires will die out
Servants to a coward, no one even dares to stand alone
Eyes roll back in terror - the panic starts to rise
Blood and death will follow
As they get wise
To the lies they believed to be real
And they will pay the price by facing the truth and its deal
When they die
At midnight they'll get wise
Watch the hunt-god rise
Bond Of Blood
A never ending tale
You lose but never fail
You're going to be the last to learn
To see what's right and wrong
You waited much too long
The truth is somewhere in between
but you've never seen
Now as I burn in fire
You will recall - you will remember my name
Smouldering sea, smoke rises
You'll see the truth
you will be taught by the flames
Bond of blood
Suppose you change your ways
A simple choice to make
You'll be rewarded by yourself
Possessing all that skill
To use at your own will
You better find another way
Or you'll go astray
Now as I burn in fire
You will recall - you will remember my name
Smouldering sea, smoke rises
You'll see the truth
you will be taught by the flames
Bond of blood
Savage Tales
See the savage son arrive
striking terror on all sides
He's been waiting all this time
for his reign to come alive
Bite
he will do or die
Fight to hold on, aim for the throne
Bite
he will burn their pride
Rise northern child you've grown
See the iron sky descend
on a world that just pretends
It's a lonely path to walk
but an honor to defend
Those who walk against the wind
will always walk alone

Born For Battle (Black Dog Of Brocéliande)
You were just a child when the flame began to burn
You could not run you could not hide
No one told you there was so much more to learn
Just would not stop before you tried
You hear the calling
Inside you knew
Born for battle
I heard the calling
Hated and scorned
My sword was the warning
I'll defend when you call for
The king has justified the cruelty and pain
A crown and glory
To revel in
Short in stature but a savior to the land
Just let them burn and let me win
I heard the calling
Inside I knew
Born for battle
I heard the calling
Hated and scorned
My sword was the warning
I'll defend to the end
I'm the underdog
Never bark before I bite
Peace a word I never learned
In war my victories mean strife and loss of lives
Never cared if I'd return
Born for battle
My need was created at birth
For glory and blood I was born – burn
Never cared if I'd return
Born for battle
I heard the calling
I'll defend when you call for battle
My sword was the warning
I was born for battle
Master Of The Land
Light, the search goes on inside
Deep within my mind
A key that seems to hide
Torn, chained and bound with scorn
Let me be reborn
Into glory ride
Make me master of the land
Master of the land
Master of the land
Answer the call into the fire burn
Free, longing to reveal
A dream so long concealed
Destiny achieved
Burn, wisdom will be mine
Secrets I will learn
Into glory ride
Make me master of the land
Master of the land
Master of the land
Answer the call into the fire
Make me master of the land
Master of the land
Master of the land
Answer the call 
Make me master of the land
Master of the land
Master of the land
Answer the call into the fire burn
Last One To Fall
Facing the enemy fear and insanity
Fight with your back to the wall
Horses are falling no quarter is given
Ravens will feast on them all
Gather your strength and ride through the storm
No one will catch you alive
It weather of blades and as twilight sets in
This is the final goodbye
Marching on -
You'll be the last one to fall
Marching on -
You'll be the last one to fall
Bereft of all dignity, pain and depravity
No one will live through this day
The sound of the suffering left as an offering
Souls sent to Valhalla's gates
You stand in the rain as you fought through it all
Tomorrow will never appear
Embracing your fate as the dusk closes in
Blood is the prize of the brave
Marching on -
You'll be the last one to fall
Marching on -
You'll be the last one to fall
Bereft of all dignity
Blood is the prize of the brave
No one will live through this day
Souls sent to Valhalla's gates
Ride through the storm
Song of the sword
You'll be marching on
You'll be the last one to fall
Marching on -
You'll be the last one to fall
Frost And Fire
Burning hair
Bringer of despair
Mother of the one who takes the moon
Fierce and tall she will devour all
And her spawn will break the seal of runes
Winds that rage across the fields and lakes
She will ride out from the frozen realm
Screaming through the sky
Wreathed in fury
With frost and fire tame the land
She'll rule, take charge and command
Shadow steed will bring her fatal deeds
And a power never seen before
Serpent reins on a wolf from Hel
She descended on the funeral shore
The gathering didn't have her strength
And she proved that she could best them all
Daughter of the ironwood has come
With frost and fire tame the land
She'll rule, take charge and command
As the ring horn sails
She has won
And her sons will rise
Frost and fire tame the land
She'll rule, take charge and command
With frost and fire tame the land
She'll rule, take charge and command
Hugr
Every Day There's A Battle To Fight
All the walls around you
No one really knows how they were made
Who chose that way?
Conformity or safety
Questioning your sanity is brave
You're not a slave, no
Too many hearts grow stale and cold
Too many die inside and fold
Everyday there's a battle to fight
Never let yourself surrender to the pain
You've got to get up
Be strong and fight them all 
Never let the fear stand in your way
Find the key inside you
Shining through the madness and the hate
It's not too late
A path is always open
Reborn into the thunder and the rain
Free from all shame, yeah
The smallest creatures have it right
The truth is grey not black and white
Everyday there's a battle to fight
Never let yourself surrender to the pain
You've got to get up
Be strong and fight them all 
Never let the fear stand in your way
Stand in your way
In For The Kill
Born again as dusk approaches
I've been living far too long as a slave
To the laws of your world
Sound the howl of total freedom
Make the sky and earth my kingdom
There's a gleam and a flash in my eyes
By tomorrow all the sorrow will be gone
I am in for the kill
One with the moon and the wind
In for the kill
One with the moon and the wind
Now their walls give no protection
The grip of fear means no detection
Of the force set upon men and gods
No belief and no religion
Will protect your life from leaving
As the fear reaches out to your soul
It's a grasp that will never let its hold
I am in for the kill
One with the moon and the wind
In for the kill
One with the moon and the wind
You will die
Starlight Slaughter
Go on tell me 'bout the reason always turning wrong from right just try, explain your sad existence, why you seem to fear the night
Your answer will show - that dead is your king
I look in your eyes - confusion within
You lose all your pride, and scream as i bite
In a starlight slaughter - vengeance will be mine
Starlight slaughter - rise of wolf kind
Too late, I asked you and i listened and groveling won't save you now
Your tales betray your lack of freedom, struggling to face the light
My Hymn to the moon piercing your mind
Your science will fail
Your eyes turn blind
When red turns to black and the silver moon is full
They will drown in lakes of blood, and regret what they tried to pull
Starlight slaughter - vengeance will be mine
Starlight slaughter - rise of wolf kind
Sword Of The Ocean
The first was the last one
The last one to fall
He sounded the warning
And put out the call
Remorseless invaders or traders with gold?
Stand or run
Will flesh pay for metal or riches be shared - stand or run
We bring the fire and the flame
Agony and pain
Sword of the ocean carve me your name
The men on the shoreline
Guardians of old
They prayed for a warning
They ran from the wall
Remorseless invaders or traders with gold?
Stand or run
Will flesh pay for metal or riches be shared - stand or run
We bring the fire and the flame
Agony and pain
Sword of the ocean carve me your name
Valhalla Rising
Feel – take my hand
See – wasted lands
‘Cause I lost my fire, and it’s tearing up my soul
Got to fight if I want it
So tired of liars, they’re filling me with shame
Got to fight and get stronger
But the road is long and treachery awaits
To find what’s wrong I have to reach and reveal to see
Valhalla rising – I’m taking flight
Let Valkyries guide me to my destiny
Valhalla rising – I burn tonight
Let ravens fly and give my soul release
The fire is the seed
Take my hand!
No more wasted lands...
I restored my fire now it’s filling up my soul
Even though I was broken
And I fought the liars – the worst of all was me
All the false words I’d spoken
As I travelled on I realised my fate
It made me strong and now I finally see what's been revealed
Valhalla rising – I’m taking flight
Let Valkyries guide me to my destiny
Valhalla rising – I burn tonight
Let ravens fly and give my soul release
The fire was the seed
Take my hand!
No more wasted lands...
And now I finally see what's been revealed
Valhalla rising – I’m taking flight
Let Valkyries guide me to my destiny
Valhalla rising – I burn tonight
Let ravens fly and give my soul release
The fire was the seed
Take my hand!
Storm King
Time to reap all the violence they have sewn
Kept you down with their torture
Crushed your bones
From slavery your rebellion screams of fire
Too late 'cause you'll never be their pawn
You've grown too strong
You're the Storm King
Ride the lightning
Rule the thunder shake the ground
Two thousand years spent imprisoned
You were chained
Born a stallion but broken down - hurt and malmed
A fury and rage ignited in the tears
they'll pay and you'll never be their pawn
You've grown too strong
You're the Storm King
Ride the lightning
Rule the thunder, shake the ground
Silver Moon
Unleashed by my hate -
Flesh torn away from the bone
A fire that burns - a fever that never subsides
Surrender to fate - free from the shackles that bind
By the silvery sheen -
The moon will decide who will die
I've found the strength to live alone
I've left my kin I've left my home
By silver light I'll carve my own
To last and live my power's grown
Embers - burning runes
Sever the ties - destiny calls
Black sky - silver moon
I'm gonna rise - you're gonna fall
Summoning fire - men of the cross stand aside
A heathen belief - northern revenge is at hand
No masters or kings -
The cry for my freedom resounds
The passion is free -
The blood-covered snow is the sign
Embers - burning runes
Sever the ties - destiny calls
Black sky - silver moon
I'm gonna rise - you're gonna fall
The Hunt
He's alive -- the stories were right
And now there's a lesson to learn
Took his land and curse him as damned
But now he will make them all burn
Tonight the grey one's arrived
To reveal all the lies, the shadow's arrived
And he won't shed a tear for our emptiness and fear
Blood will spill
I follow the hunt
Chase and kill
Follow the hunt
Running free, the beast inside of me
Will join in his howl to the moon
Every sense come alive
And the passion ignites
'cause his beckoning call brings us doom
Tonight the grey one's arrived
To reveal all the lies, the shadow's arrived
And he won't shed a tear for our emptiness and fear
Blood will spill
I follow the hunt
Chase and kill
Follow the hunt
Blood will stain the land
As the hunt will take command
Tonight the grey one's arrived
To reveal all the lies,
Blood will spill
I follow the hunt
Chase and kill
Follow the hunt
Blood will spill
We follow the hunt
Chase and kill
We follow the hunt
Son Of The Last Breath: Part I -- Nattfödd, Part II -- Vedergällning
One night in November my soul found a heart
In glistening frost by the light of the stars
One night in November my soul found its home
In the glow of the moon I was born
All my grief washed away
It's the end of my plight
No mourning was left
Only feral delight
All my grief washed away
By the blood that was shed
In the glow of the moon I was born
Hide all trace
Count the days
Nine to reach my fate
Nine days t obring the change
Destiny fulfilled
Eight brings me sight
Seven gives me light
Six days and wounds are healed
Strength has returned
Bless the mighty Thor
Blood will stain your shores
Swear I will return
Prepare yourself for war
Praise the mighty Thor
Blood will stain your shores
Swear I will return
Prepare yourself for war
I will hide all trace
Count the days
Nine to reach my fate
Swear to return
Nine days to bring the change
Destiny fulfilled
Five proves me right
Four ends the fight
Three, two and one completes the change
Then I will rise
Iron Hand
You speak of hell and how you fell
Looking out for something new
You broke the law, you've seen it all
Really nothing more to tell
But you miss a vital piece - the key to everlasting power
Yes you lack the inner strength - a way to push them all aside
Steel will guide you right
Got to keep it locked inside you at all times - never let them see the way to climb
Rulel them all - feel the grip of an iron hand - take command
Rule them - to make it last and to remain, never let confusion reign
You speak of pain and always claim
You never really had a chance
But there's a call to break them all
Listen now or try in vain
There's a way to build the strength - a path to everlasting power
Summon up the right defense - and you'll break their will to fight
Steel will guide you right
Got to keep it locked inside you at all times, never let them see the way to climb
Rule them all - feel the grip of an iron hand - take command
Rule them - to make it last and to remain, never let confusion reign
Rule them all
Rule with an iron hand or you will fall
There's a lock inside the lonely cell, but we fail to find the key
There's a way to solve the riddles quick, but we always choose to leace
If the urge to hurt the weaker one gets stronger than before
Maybe wisdom leaves us all alone and we'll never break the door
If we refuse to take heed or learn - why would I stay or be concerned?
If the madness will spread like fire - why would I wish I could return?
There's a wall that separates us and divides
Hide the greed - put on a pleasant smile
Break the fall yet you're ashamed to be alive
Build a solid web of lies, web of lies
So we're pushing on for selfishness, while me march on forever blind
We develop as we sell our souls, and the connection is lost in time
If we refuse to take heed or learn - why would I stay or be concerned?
If the madness would spread like fire - why would I wish I could return?
There's a wall that separates us and divides
Hide the greed - put on a pleassant smile
Break the fall yet you're ashamed to be alive
Build a solid we b of lies, web of lies
No use in waiting for it - your kind will never understand
What separates us is a plan
There's a wall that separates us and divides
Hide the greed - put on a pleasant smile
Break the fall yet you're ashamed to be alive
Spin a solid web of lies, web of lies
