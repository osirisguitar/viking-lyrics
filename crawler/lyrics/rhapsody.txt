Emerald Sword
Crossed the valleys the dust of midlands
to search for the third key to open the gates
Now I'm near the altar the secret inside
as legend told my beloved sun light the dragons eyes
On the way to the glory I'll honour my sword
to serve right ideals and justice for all
Finally happened the sun lit their eyes
the spell was creating strange games of light
Thanks to hidden mirrors I found my lost way
over the stones I reached the place it was a secret cave
In a long bloody battle that prophecies told
the light will prevail hence wisdom is gold
For the king for the land for the mountains
For the green valleys where dragons fly
For the glory the power to win the black lord
I will search for the emerald sword
Only a warrior with a clear heart
could have the honour to be kissed by the sun
Yes, I'm that warrior I followed my way
led by the force of cosmic soul I can reach the sword
On the way th the glory I'll honour my sword
to serve right ideals and justice for all
For the king for the land for the mountains
For the green valleys where dragons fly
For the glory the power to win the black lord
I will search for the emerald sword
Wisdom Of The Kings
Removed the stones which hide the cave
blind and dark along my way
I must go on wise and brave before a last hail
At the end of floor stairs  of ancient stone
lead me to a vision, an unreal hall
And they appear in front of me
lightened by a mystic flame
A new dimension I have to face beyond the gates
I can not believe oh what now I see
when the two demons awake from the sleep
Holy dragons keepers of time
Ride brave the blue skies and spell my eyes
Fly beyond these hills ride on the wind
The wisdom of the kings
Lost in a dream I'm under the spell
of this sunny magic land
But Aresius said: Become aware! All can hide the hell...
Now it's time to go to the mighty sword
it's time to follow the kings holy call
Holy dragons keepers of time
Ride brave the blue skies and spell my eyes
Fly beyond these hills ride on the wind
The wisdom of the kings
Heroes Of The Lost Valley
"Yes, mighty warrior... What you hear now are the suffering, voices of all
the heroes that crossed these lands before you. They ended their quest tragically
but their thirst for victory is still alive and breathers through these
ancient rocks corroded by the fury of the wind. Their pride now rides with you..."
Eternal Glory
Echoes of terror in this old land
I see the result of their quest
Skulls of old heroes lie everywhere in this mystical place
Dust in their eyes, dust in my pride
in this infinite journey to the ancient sword
I can hear their lament between these rocks
the whisper on an angry ghost
he speaks for them all trapped on this lost world
I am their very last hope
to ride from hell free once again
to break the chains from a bloody past for my victory
Eternal glory ride fast to me
pound in my heart for the Algalord kings
Eternal glory spread your wide wings
fly and forever lead my holy steel
I'll fight I'll cry for your silence your name
You'll live through me I will end all your pain
for the swan in the lake the bird on the tree
the place for my beloved lands
The black king is near and Algalord calls
so heroes of the lost valley raise all your voice
Eternal glory ride fast to me
pound in my heart for the Algalord kings
Eternal glory spread your wide wings
fly and forever lead my holy steel
Beyond The Gates Of Infinity
Fire of wisdom light the sky
let me go no through this dark evil ground
A veil of fog now covers all
something is happening my heart must be strong
Keep away monsters of hell
No, I won't give you my inviting flesh
Deformed creatures all around me
crept out from ancient and unholy crypts
They'll be your madness they'll be your end
they'll lick your bones and they'll drink your brain
Keep away monsters of hell
No, I won't give you my inviting flesh
Your tongue will be torn your bowels my food
your body impaled of shit will be full
now foolish warrior hear my words
You are condemned and you will come
with us all beyond the gates of infinity
I'm the mighty warrior herd of the northern lands
Algalord is calling so your hell must wait
Your tongue will be torn your bowels my food
your body impaled of shit will be full
now foolish warrior hear my words
You are condemned and you will come
with us all beyond the gates of infinity
Wings Of Destiny
Day has gone but I'm still here with you
my sweet rose my green hills
beloved sea, lakes and sky
beloved mother earth
Silent land erase my thoughts
I wanna lose myself in you, all in you
caress me and my soul
while I close my eyes
On wings of destiny
through virgin skies
to far horisons I will fly
Dear peaceful land, dear mother earth
caress my soul while I close my eyes
On wings of destiny
through virgin skies
to far horisons I will fly
The Dark Tower Of Abyss
Spread your wings to dark horisons
fly where the twilight reigns
Mighty Tharos cross the line of hell
it's so near
Lost in the shadow I search for my sun
Fly and face it before the new moon
there where chaos rules
Domine deterges nubila caeld
Bellator a proposito non deterreres
Unholy vision ancestral terror
spare my mind my innocent eyes
"...And suddenly the the unreal silence is broken by a lament...
A lament coming up from the deepest Darkest abyss...
And from the seven gates of the dark fortress
the dead come back to life to face him... this is hell..."
Immortal fire now light my heart light my way
Face the old legend the guardian of space and time
Living dead on black winged demons
fly high to play with your head
Gothic portals mystic towers
between the dark clouds
Lost in the shadow I search for my sun
Fly and face it before the new moon
there where chaos rules
Riding The Winds Of Eternity
Wise and mighty you are force of the earth

Symphony Of Enchanted Lands
"Oh, cruel, destiny... The tears soon covered the warrior's face and Tharos,
the beloved dragon, spread his wings for the last time, happy to have found
the freedom at least in death... Fly... fly high, mighty Tharos... Your name
will always be remembered by the people of the enchanted lands... and your
memory will march with us forever against the hordes of the black lord for
the salvation of the enchanted lands.
Goodbye, brother... goodbye...!!"
God of dawn, father of thunder
Lord of the wind now blowing on me
Thank you for all, for your holy sign
For mountains and hills, the forest, the sea
for all those dead and for my princess
they'll shed their blood cause finally
the emerald sword is now mine
For what you did to them
you will burn in my hate
Son of hell betrayer of light
king of the dark your name is carved on my steel
for your will the innocent die every day
but my sword will soon come for you all
and your kingdom will fall
and you'll be dust again forever
Rex tremende semper inimice
ad gloriam perpetuam brave all we'll march
to give you the eternal agony
Love magic word fill all my dreams eternally use me
Love guide me to ecstasy to victory to infinity
to rhymes of winds to the voice of the dead

Rape of earth I want your head
sadist pig I can't forgive what you did

But my sword will soon come for you all
and your kingdom will fall
and you'll be dust again forever
Rex tremende semper inimice
ad gloriam perpetuam brave all we'll march
to give you the eternal agony
"Go, mighty warrior... The kings of enchanted lands are awaiting your
victory! Ride on the wings of wisdom, ride beyond the middle valleys to
defeat the master of chaos in the name of cosmic justice. Peace and love
forever!"
"At the court of king Chaos only blood
can write its own tragedy..."
Mighty warriors from the silver hills
march, all led by golden winds
Elves and trolls from holy mystic woods
run through the last snow
He's now coming from the middle lands
handling proud his magic sword
Glory, pride and honor ride with him
Burns the flame of north
They will all meet in the Kazar ruins
not so far from Ancelot
In the temple of the fallen one
their hope will be born...
Born from the ashes of ancient glory... Born!
They all hail the mighty chosen one
reaching the skies with their cry
They are ready to reach Ancelot
Arwald's calling loud...
"Glory ride with us!  Lux Triumphans!
Magic and steelgods lead us to a new dawn..."
Dawn Of Victory
Fire is raging on the battlefield
while Arwald is fighting the war of the kings
The army of Dargor, the thunder, the storm...
so people are calling the brave and his sword
No time left to save the wise throne!
Shades of a past not so far to forget...
the rise of the demons from their bloody hell!
So come mighty warrior to light the lost hope
for Tharos the dragon and your cosmic soul...
Now handle your emerald sword!
For Ancelot
the ancient cross of war
for the holy town of gods
Gloria, gloria perpetua
in this dawn of victory
The ride of the dead and their practice of pain
is pounding in him as a terrific quake
You're closer and closer now follow their smell
with your holy armour the steel in your hand
Fly angel of bloody revenge!
For Ancelot
the ancient cross of war
for the holy town of gods
Gloria, gloria perpetua
in this dawn of victory
Tragic and furious the clash of the steel of the gods
and so magic the power, the sword in his valorous hands
Oceans of fire are blasting the throne of the demons
and from distant red skies the thunders are calling his name
the name of the master of pain!
For Ancelot
the ancient cross of war
for the holy town of gods
Gloria, gloria perpetua
in this dawn of victory
Triumph For My Magic Steel
Flies to where old dragons are lying
the cry for the triumph for my magic sword
Burns the pride of my mighty conscience
while rises the sceptre of our wise lord
So thunder and storm, the rage of the sword
the fury of my war
The axe of the dwarf, the blood on the stone
the scream for the eternal
Rage in the wind at the triumph for my magic steel
you will taste the blade of the ancient sword... and
Rage in the wind at the triumph for my magic steel
led by hundreds of mighty and fallen lords
Dead, laments and unholy sorrow
The heads of the fallen are staining the snow
May this be the last hated cruel war
I'm looking at my skies but they answer not!
So thunder and storm, the rage of the sword
the fury of my war
The axe of the dwarf, the blood on the stone
the scream for the eternal
Rage in the wind at the triumph for my magic steel
you will taste the blade of the ancient sword... and
Rage in the wind at the triumph for my magic steel
led by hundreds of mighty and proudly fallen brave lords
Old cathedrals dusty graves where nest the seeds of holy victory
Blood from old crypts gushing out to drown the deadly cosmic enemy
Steel all around for the king and his crown
Winds of the dawn are caressing us all...
Ancelot smiles at the knights' epic cry
Thanks to the old and their emerald sword
The kingdom is now hailing the triumph over Dargor
and he the man from Loregard he stands in front of all... of all!
The Village Of Dwarves
The dwarves of Lork are showing all their honour
when you walk on the Gandor secret hill
The dance for fire and wind
and the stories about old kings
are pleasing our brave lords
down in the village of dwarves
The elves are playing under timeless willows
while blue and red paint all my beloved land
The dance for fire and wind
and the stories about old kings
are pleasing our brave lords
down in the village of dwarves
The eagle's eye is hiding something tragic
but in this night the red wine rules in me
The dance for fire and wind
and the stories about old kings
are pleasing our brave lords
down in the village of dwarves
And all night long me Arwald and Aresius
we speak, we laugh, we honor our king
The dance for fire and wind
and the stories about old kings
are pleasing our brave lords
down in the village of dwarves
And time has come now to ride
before the end of the night
the march of the swordmaster
to the unholy fight
Dargor, Shadowlord Of The Black Mountain
Mighty and brave is the fighter of shade
He's prince of the darklands... Dargor his name
Adopted by Vankar, old wizard of Helm
disciple of evil he twisted his brain
Fire burns between pride and honour
Steel wild pounds in his dragonheart
Face to face with the cult of evil
Prince of lands of the darkest dream
We sing to the wind the legend of the kings
to spread our heart to the kingdom of dust
where heroes are lost, where's reigning the shadowlord
Power and glory but for the wrong side
For his tragic past he disowned the sunlight
But Akron knows well all the truth of that day
He needs him as fighter, a warrior so brave
Fire burns between pride and honour
Steel wild pounds in his dragonheart
Face to face with the cult of evil
Prince of lands of the darkest dream
We sing to the wind the legend of the kings
to spread our heart to the kingdom of dust
where heroes are lost, where's reigning the shadowlord
The Bloody Rage Of The Titans
Between my trees the unicorn runs
from the highest mountains the water falls
Flowers and plants now caress my eyes
along these holy valleys kissed by light
And I am victim of this spell
wonderful symphony of enchanted lands...
The whisper of spring is now carried by winds
the winds from the land of the fire
Where peace is a gift from the king of the kings
It seems so strongly unreal... unreal!
Dragons and demons beware!
It's the rage of the titans...
Is the titans' bloody rage!
Warlords and steelgods beware!
It's the rage of the titans...
Is the titans' bloody rage!
The oak, my sister, smiles at the sun
now free from the weight of winter
The eagles fly from mountain to mountain
enchanting my heart... brave heart!
Dragons and demons beware!
It's the rage of the titans...
Is the titans' bloody rage!
Warlords and steelgods beware!
It's the rage of the titans...
Is the titans' bloody rage!
Holy Thunderforce
Face me evil bastard, smell the hate of angels
Glory, pride and bloodshed
Cowards and beholders, rapers of my wisdom
mix of dust and bones
Go back to your abyss, Algalord will not fall
but your heads will soon roll
Test the blade of heroes, fury of the thunder
hit my golden shield
So we'll fight against the wind for the glory of the kings
to defeat the evil enemies
And we'll ride with our lord for the power and the throne
in the name of holy thunderforce
Arwald and Aresius with the nordic warrior
on their way to Hargor
Chaos and oblivion, turmoil and disorder
will have now their name
The last fallen heroes will defeat your forces
Thousand spirits calling
On the furthest mountain I will see your fire
quenched by holy frost!
So we'll fight against the wind for the glory of the kings
to defeat the evil enemies
And we'll ride with our lord for the power and the throne
in the name of holy thunderforce
Trolls In The Dark
The Last Winged Unicorn
The seven red flames of the cave
are lightning the horrible torture
constricted to see he regrets
to have had the life from his god
Airin sheds black tears supporting the terrible rape
the fury of the sons of the thunder
is breaking the mystical chain
Arwald falls so to his knees
while Akron the black king is laughing
the princess falls down on the stones
with no breath of life anymore
May your ambition lead you to the unholy name
So my soul will fight you forever
in one of the many new hells
From the holy sea of golden flames
flies the last winged unicorn
With its magic breath of innocence
rising to the crystal throne
Skies are spitting holy fire wisdom cries and deadly whispers flow
Flow down to silent mystic shores
Shores of spirits thirst for vengeance waiting for their holy crystal gate
Gate to the sunny holy lands
"Lands of a timeless world...
an enchanted timeless world like no other...
there where magic flowers paint the cosmic landscape
and noone knows the word... pain!"
Tears of blood and sadness formed the wonderful silent lake
Swans and birds in water games will call Airin's name... her name!
And now is the time to decide
on a way to escape from the cavern
the old silver chains on the wall
are now also trapping their souls
Airin my princess I can not endure all my pain
but I swear to you on my proud name...
you'll open the mystical gate!
From the holy sea of golden flames
flies the last winged unicorn
With its magic breath of innocence
rising to the crystal throne
The Mighty Ride Of The Firelord
Cruel Akron bloody bastard I now spit on you
You can turn my bones to black ash but I'll move the moon
I will light your evil kingdom
and your heart will burn in flames
Mutilated or dismembered
we'll soon rise to eat your brain
You will pay for your victims and for Airin's bloody rape
For Arwald my dear friend and all my crying wasted land
I call the rage of my dead
I call the black angels' tears
Also Dargor can't endure all... goes out from the cave
while the demons take the hero for their tragic game
Gods of earth save me from madness
from these rites of total shame
while descending in the red flame
Arwald dies but not in vain
They will pay for this nightmare, for the symphony of pain
For Airin, my dead friend and all my crying wasted land
I call the Tharos' fire
I call the thunder roar
Raise your voice and ride all
ride all brave, raise your sword to the sky
and sing the epic symphony
for the mighty and proud firelord
Arwald's acid broke the silver chains
before his very last breath
Akron laughing really doesn't know what now waits for him...
Gods are raging leading my red steel
heads and limbs are falling down
It's in me the mystic messenger bringer of revenge
"Black angel, I call you! King Chaos is raging
in the torment of my heart...
I call the holy earthquake to end this bloody hell!"
Gods are raging leading my red steel
heads and limbs are falling down
It's in me the mystic messenger bringer of revenge
while she comes, beloved sunlight
On the river known as Aigor
our hero found his way
All the demons desperately
search for him now but in vain
They will pay for this nightmare, for the symphony of pain
For Airin, my dead friend and all my crying wasted land
I call the Tharos' fire
I call the thunder roar
Raise your voice and ride all
ride all brave, raise your sword to the sky
and sing the epic symphony
for the mighty and proud firelord
Knightrider Of Doom
The fading illusion the sirens' grey tears
it's here in the cold air the town's tragic fear
The breath of infernos the rise of the dead
the portals of chaos the seventh black flame
IN THIS BLOODY DAWN
I WILL WASH MY SOUL
TO CALL THE SPIRIT OF VENGEANCE
TO DENY MY WISDOM FOR ANGER
TO BREAK THE SCREAM OF THE SILENT FOOL
AND TO BE THE SON OF DOOM...
OF DOOM!
IN THIS BLOOD DAWN
I WILL WASH MY SOUL
TO CALL THE SPIRIT OF VENGEANCE
TO DENY MY WISDOM FOR ANGER
TO BREAK THE SCREAM OF THE SILENT FOOL
TO BE A KNIGHTRIDER OF DOOM...
OF DOOM!
The rites of the unborn the dragonship's fall
the waves of my ocean the twins' holy call
The march of the heroes the call of the gods
after the rituals on the silent shore
IN THIS BLOODY DAWN
I WILL WASH MY SOUL
TO CALL THE SPIRIT OF VENGEANCE
TO DENY MY WISDOM FOR ANGER
TO BREAK THE SCREAM OF THE SILENT FOOL
AND TO BE THE SON OF DOOM...
OF DOOM!
IN THIS BLOODY DAWN
I WILL WASH MY SOUL
TO CALL THE SPIRIT OF VENGEANCE
TO DENY MY WISDOM FOR ANGER
TO BREAK THE SCREAM OF THE SILENT FOOL
TO BE A KNIGHTRIDER OF DOOM...
OF DOOM!
The Power Of The Dragonflame
Rise mighty dragon...
Rise, rise, rise, rise...
Mighty dragon rise!
Ruins of ancient wisdom closing now my darkest lonely eye
god is dead in Thorald and in Elnor's rhyme
Mutilated bodies are now carved in ancient holy stone
tragic decoration of unholy wars
The heart of the dragon is screaming awaiting
to write the black last page
The page of blood was written by them...
the dead now lying on the sand
Visions of disaster are now challenging the wild storms
cyclops of the midlands wash my bloody shore
Sirens from the open seas now heal my broken wounded brain
I call the holy typhoons... air, fire, earth!
The heart of the dragon is screaming awaiting
to write the black last page
The page of blood was written by them...
the dead now lying on the sand
FROM THE SILENT HILL WE SCREAM LOUD YOUR NAME
MIGHTY POWER OF THE DRAGONFLAME
FROM THE MOUNTAINS PROUD AND STRONG
WE CALL OUR DRAGONLORD
Mighty dragon rise... rise!
The heart of the dragon is screaming awaiting
to write the black last page
The page of blood was written by them...
the dead now lying on the sand
FROM THE SILENT HILL WE SCREAM LOUD YOUR NAME
MIGHTY POWER OF THE DRAGONFLAME
FROM THE MOUNTAINS PROUD AND STRONG
WE CALL OUR DRAGONLORD
The March Of The Swordmaster
Ride... die... sacrifice!
Along the river of bloody tears
the mighty steel shining in my hands
we march and honor our brothers
victims of Kron's evil plan
We cross the lakes of the holy woods
to reach the ocean where red waves rule
the black king is moving to Algalord
this is the time... he has to be stopped!
HAIL, HAIL!
...Brave Swordmaster!
MARCH, MARCH!
...Great Swordmaster!
and I ask the wind for the fall of the king...!
INTO THE RAY OF THE SUN
MARCH OUR HERO HUNTING THE DARKLORD
REBORN FROM THE BLOOD OF HIS GOD...
HIS GOD... THE WARMASTER KRON
RIDE FOR THE FALL OF HIS POWER
FIGHTING THE STORM, THE ROAR OF THE THUNDER
ALLY OF THE SUN AND THE MOON...
GREAT SWORDMASTER RULE!
Between the waves of the raging sea
echoes of warcries and battle hymns
the underworld's armies found their ancient queen
the funeral march in the depths of the abyss
The terror which strikes the honor which prays
will be face to face in the mortal doomsday
Resist my fierce soldiers their vision can kill
it will test your courage... and your will to live
HAIL, HAIL!
...Brave Swordmaster!
MARCH, MARCH!
...Great Swordmaster!
and I ask the wind for the fall of the king...!
INTO THE RAY OF THE SUN
MARCH OUR HERO HUNTING THE DARKLORD
REBORN FROM THE BLOOD OF HIS GOD...
HIS GOD... THE WARMASTER KRON
RIDE FOR THE FALL OF HIS POWER
FIGHTING THE STORM, THE ROAR OF THE THUNDER
ALLY OF THE SUN AND THE MOON...
GREAT SWORDMASTER RULE!
To avenge all those cries I will rise to the sky
to defend mother life...
Ride... die... sacrifice!
When Demons Awake
Oh god don't forsake me, I need to survive
the unholy vision, the eternal bloody night
He pronounced the rites, the slimy queen's awake
the cause is the sword, my sword in Akron's hands
The vomit of evil, the venom of death
is crashing my wisdom, is blocking my legs
They all suck the blood, have ecstasy in pain
eating their flesh, devouring their brains
Dead and vampires spit out from hell...
is the new legion of the lord of the damned
The vengeance of the gods, soon their heads will roll
Oh, bringer of chaos... you will pay for all!
Bowels' rain around me, brothers mutilated
oh disfigured faces, flying army and bones
Fuck you bloody bastard, demon's raped soul
die into oblivion with your shitty sons
I'M THE NORDIC WARRIOR
HUNTER OF THE MARCHING DEAD
I'M THE BLOODY HAND OF TYTANS
WHEN... WHEN DEMONS AWAKE
Inferno apri rubami l'anima
voglio sfidare l'oscuro demone
Tutto e' in me, cielo e oceani
fratelli gargoyles, volate qui da me
Oh god don't forsake me, I need to survive
the unholy vision, the eternal bloody night
He pronounced the rites, the slimy queen's awake
the cause is the sword, my sword in Akron's hands
The vomit of evil, the venom of death
is crashing my wisdom, is blocking my legs
They all suck the blood, have ecstasy in pain
eating their flesh, devouring their brains
I'M THE NORDIC WARRIOR
HUNTER OF THE MARCHING DEAD
I'M THE BLOODY HAND OF TYTANS
WHEN... WHEN DEMONS AWAKE
Agony Is My Name
One for the pain and two for my name
three for my wonderful kingdom
Four for my king, five for my queen
Six for the fall of my wisdom...
Earth's calling me!
Airin, Arwald, Tharos in my painful dreams
Horror and death crossing my way
paint all the unreal landscape
Villages burn, the black fire runs...
runs through the heart of the forest...
killing my trees!
ALGALORD'S CALLING FOR HOLY REVENGE
THE RAGE OF THE HEROES IN MY HANDS
THE FURY WILL RISE AND SOON
THEY WILL TASTE MY SILVER BLADE
AND THEY WILL FACE THE PROPHECY
'CAUSE AGONY IS... MY NAME!
Black is the rose that's now in my hand
black for the blood of the fallen
symbol of death will soon be reborn
into the life of my tears' fall...
reborn and grow!
Silent cries of children in my painful dreams
ALGALORD'S CALLING FOR HOLY REVENGE
THE RAGE OF THE HEROES IN MY HANDS
THE FURY WILL RISE AND SOON
THEY WILL TASTE MY SILVER BLADE
AND THEY WILL FACE THE PROPHECY
'CAUSE AGONY IS... MY NAME!
ALGALORD'S CALLING FOR HOLY REVENGE
THE RAGE OF THE HEROES IN MY HANDS
THE FURY WILL RISE AND SOON
THEY WILL TASTE MY SILVER BLADE
AND THEY WILL FACE THE PROPHECY
'CAUSE AGONY IS... MY NAME!
Languishes in me the broken echo
at the grim look of the blind angel
ruins in me the ancient rhyme
in the heart of the wounded, dying swan
Worlds of betrayed eternity
Of vanished truth, that are now shedding
Tears of farewell into a black void
Proud and sincere, I'll go (to meet) my destiny
The thunder cries
my heroic lament,
fate ... consume reality.
Spirits of arcane worlds
I ask for life beyond death
To align the friendly stars
And to become a celestial guardian
Keeper of healed eternity
Of truth found for all children of mother earth
Always to her I have always given (my) life. (my) death.
thus I will continue.
The thunder cries
my heroic lament,
fate ... consume reality.
Steelgods Of The Last Apocalypse
Soon... winter again...
...snowlord come...
Come and cover those grey walls...
...VIOLENCE CALLS!
I want his fall...
his epic fall... in this evil war...
...fought to protect our ancient throne
From this grey prison I look at you
my lost and beloved wasted holy town
I call the prophecy's miracle
the thunder of the ancient book's word
WE ARE...
WE ARE THE ONES...
WHO'LL FACE THE STEELGODS
OF THIS LAST APOCALYPSE...
...OF THE LAST APOCALYPSE!
Now... Algalord lies...
in the shades...
of my shy mystic rainbow...
...VIOLENCE CALLS!
I want his fall...
his epic fall... in this evil war...
...trapped behind these humid walls
Raise all your eyes to the autumn skies
capture the energy of that sight
They can have fun with my limbs and bones
but I swear my spirit will never fall
WE ARE...
WE ARE THE ONES...
WHO'LL FACE THE STEELGODS
OF THIS LAST APOCALYPSE...
...OF THE LAST APOCALYPSE!
The Pride Of The Tyrant
Back into the fire I will have my sword
He won one fight but not the total war
Hurricanes will wipe out the dynasty of Kron
The chains of steel can't hold the holy storm
Sunshine is lighting the ruins of the ancient town
the seven towers are screaming their pain so loud
With my eagles I'll fly free
from snowy mountains to crystal seas
WE WILL FLY TO THE EMPIRE OF STEELGODS
TO DISCOVER THE SECRET OF STORMS
AND AGAINST THE BLACK PRIDE OF THE TYRANT
WE'LL USE IT TO DEFEND OUR THRONE
Dargor don't believe him... listen to my words!
You are the one who can still save your soul
Akron is the bastard... he massacred all
The evil hand that serves the will of Kron
You hate the tyrant as I and now don't deny
Give me the power to show you that I am right
With my eagles I'll fly free
from snowy mountains to crystal seas
WE WILL FLY TO THE EMPIRE OF STEELGODS
TO DISCOVER THE SECRET OF STORMS
AND AGAINST THE BLACK PRIDE OF THE TYRANT
WE'LL USE IT TO DEFEND OUR THRONE
Seven flames to not forget, to be sure I'll not regret... ever!
...to become the rage of god... Chaos bringer worse than Kron...
beware!
Back into the fire I will have my sword
He won one fight but not the total war
Dargor don't believe him... listen to my words!
You are the one who can still save your soul
You hate the tyrant as I and now don't deny
Give me the power to show you that I am right
With my eagles I'll fly free
from snowy mountains to crystal seas
WE WILL FLY TO THE EMPIRE OF STEELGODS
TO DISCOVER THE SECRET OF STORMS
AND AGAINST THE BLACK PRIDE OF THE TYRANT
WE'LL USE IT TO DEFEND OUR THRONE
Rise From The Sea Of Flames
Mirror of tragic reflections
I'll break your glass showing pain
pain for the infernal vision
pain for that red bloody rain
Trapped in this lonely oblivion
dishonoured by acts not to name
I search for answers forgotten
trying not to become insane
Baptized in fire is the dark knight who rides in me
against the raging wind
RISE FROM THE WIDE SEA OF FLAMES
TO THE VALLEYS OF ETERNITY
RISE FROM THE WIDE SEA OF FLAMES
TO LEAD ME AGAINST THE ENEMY
FOR THE RUIN OF THE KING
Hope of dark stone are now falling
under attack of the ghouls
crashing the high dragons' tower
witness of legend untold
My brothers run through the grey streets
not spared by the queen's deadly call
some throw themselves from the high walls
denying the torture of soul
Baptized in fire is the dark knight who rides in me
against the raging wind
RISE FROM THE WIDE SEA OF FLAMES
TO THE VALLEYS OF ETERNITY
RISE FROM THE WIDE SEA OF FLAMES
TO LEAD ME AGAINST THE ENEMY
FOR THE RUIN OF THE KING
Gargoyles, Angels Of Darkness
The prophet told of loud thunders quaking the surface of earth
when the black raven would have turned victim of wonderful spells
He would have become a white swan born from the darklands of sin
Neither would Aresius have believed what was now changing in him
Swan... prince of the magic lake... Dargor's your name...
GARGOYLES, FLY
GARGOYLES, RISE
GARGOYLES, FLY HIGH...!
ANGELI DI PIETRA MISTICA
Another mess of vampires, masquerade of sadistic pride
He could not endure these cruel games
against him who once spared its life
He realized so not too late to be really far from his king
far from his infinite blood thirst, too far to call them right for him
Rise... fly high and steal his soul... angels of stone...
GARGOYLES, FLY
GARGOYLES, RISE
GARGOYLES, FLY HIGH...!
Gargoyles, oh my brother gargoyles
Rise now, rise for his soul
Dargor, do it... it must be done...
free your rage and light your soul...
It's Gaia's call...
...the powerful energies of the furthest secret cosmos heard
so the prayer of our mother Gaia, the supreme spirit
who gave us the miracle of life... and her dark son breathed new life...
The power of the dragonflame was realizing what had seemed to be impossible...
And this is then the epic end
of the legendary tale
of the one who found the light
and the dragonflame inside
of the tragic rain of a thousand flames
of the town's defenders who faced pain
of symphonies of enchanted lands
of whispers of love and hate
The dawn of victory can breathe in the wind
and this would mean the great rebirth
reborn, the one who's giving his life
...the towns lying on the ground
Be one (Be one!) of us (of us!) and
act as all the prophecies want...
To mountains and valleys, to fire and snow,
to sun, moon and wisdom rise your soul...
it's the call...!
Oh no, oh god, oh god no
What is happening?
Oh, god, my god...
it happened... it happened!
Dargor mortally struck the queen of the dead and called the mighty gargoyles against the legions of darkness...
He pushed Akron into the hands of the nordic warrior, now a dying victim of terrible tortures... the chosen one let himself fall into the deep marshes constraining the black king, with the emerald sword again in his hands, not to move... they became food for the snakes of the abyss...
But this sacrifice had a terrific and great effect and Akron's death meant the victory on the evil forces of abyss... once... forever...
Remember, proud brothers... everything is possible... when you let the mystic power of the dragonflame burn in your heart... believe it... ...it's the dragonflame!
May there be misery for you, king of darkness
From the beginning to your holy end
Cruel fights and epic fury
Against disciples of darkness
For the eternal glory of the light

Against injustice and ruin

May there be misery for you, king of darkness
Cruel king.

Legendary Tales
And darkness covers all the land
the silent river flows
the jesters dance around the flame
playing an ancient song
A song of mighty warriors
of epic bloody fights
while moonlight meets the manor's walls
and I must close my eyes
Another tale of infinite wars
for the defenders of holy light
the fire enters my mind
the blood of the innocent before my eyes
spreading the wings of the dream
I want to win between fire and steel
for them all
Some knights sleep near fire
drowned in their own red wine
the elder looks at the high flame
knowing the fight will reprise
The magic twittering of the birds
meets the light of dawn
the ancient song is fading now
but my old dream carries on
Another tale of infinite wars
for the defenders of holy light
the fire enters my mind
the blood of the innocent before my eyes
spreading the wings of the dream
I want to win between fire and steel
for them all

Emerald Sword
I crossed the valleys the dust of midlands
to search for the third key to open the gates
Now I'm near the altar the secret inside
as legend told my beloved sun light the dragon?s eyes
On the way to the glory I?ll honor my sword
to serve right and justice for all
Finally happened the sun lit their eyes
the spell was creating strange games of light
Thanks to hidden mirrors I found my lost way
over the stones I reached the place it was a secret cave
In a long bloody battle that prophecies told
the light will prevail hence wisdom is gold
For the king for the land for the mountains
for the green valleys where dragons fly
for the glory the power to win the black lord
I will search for the emerald sword
Only a warrior with a clear heart
could have the honor to be kissed by the sun
Yes, I?m that warrior I followed my way
led by the force of cosmic soul I can reach the sword
On the way to the glory I?ll honor my sword
to serve right ideals and justice for all
For the king for the land for the mountains
for the green valleys where dragons fly
for the glory the power to win the black lord
I will search
Where Dragons Flymm
The way is long, time is too short
this little footpath seems never to end
Green are the trees, musk on the stones
how it looks strange this mystical world
Sweet smelling rose what do you hide
behind your innocence red like my blood
Hungry for victory, hungry for love
love for the earth that made her son
strong and invincible serving my cry
go now and ride there where dragons fly 
The rocks appear in front of me
when the first shadows pretude to dark
Near is your end wild holy path
open my eyes to what the sun hides
Beloved mountain what do you hide
Where does your river flow, I want to know
Hungry for victory, hungry for love
love for the earth that made her son
strong and invincible serving my cry
go now and ride there where dragons fly
Land Of Immortals
Hear the silence of the winds making 
your own destiny go and face the 
mirror of their sin Only brave hearts 
found the way breaking all the 
dragon's spell cross the Argon's
glade with heart in hand
Land of immortals I wait for my day 
to reach the wisdom of your skies 
Land of immortals you must belong 
to me from here to eternity
And between Elgard's hills near the 
ancient ruins of Kron you will face 
the trick of the old dwarf To obtain 
the second key you have to cross them 
bloody sea where the thirst of Tharos 
never ends
Land of immortals I wait for my day 
to reach the wisdom of your skies 
Land of immortals you must belong
to me from here to eternity
Holy force of wisdom spread through
all the air I shall breathe you forever
to end this epic holy quest My way 
will be hard but I would do all to reach 
the valleys where true heroes ride 
beyond the ivory gates
Land of immortals I wait for my day to 
reach the wisdom of your skies Land 
of immortals you must belong to me 
from here to eternity
The Dark Secret
"It was a good time for all creatures of the earth, but fate decreed that the dark prophecy of a demon knight could bring a tragic end to this peace
scarring their lives forever. Shortly before his defeat in the last of the primordial wars between the heavens and hells the evil son of the Hell God Kron,
known as Nekron, withdrew to his lair in the underworld.
There, sensing his impending death he inscribed a testament of pure evil in seven black books. One by one six of these books were discovered through out
the ages, however the seventh, last and most terrible of all contained the secret of his resurrection.
He commanded seven immortal demons to carry out his dark plan.
But they were turned into stone by the angels of the crystal realms.
And so his dreams slept with them until a time came when the forces of evil would usurp the earth.
Nekron would rule in the unholy name! of cosmic chaos.
And this time he would reign supreme!"

written to save our lands

- THE WHITE DRAGON'S ORDER
"And so the Order of the White Dragon decreed Khaas the hero of the middle lands. He and princess Lothen from the kingdom of the ancient waterfalls,
together with Tharish, elven king of the caverns and myself, Iras Algor from Hor-Lad, would travel the path of incredible danger and great adventure.
Dargor the shadowlord would lead us through the ancient underworld of Dar-Kunor. Finally the time had come to find the legendary seventh black book, that
containing the worst of all the known prophecies"
The Last Angels' Call
After five long days the final plan
the wise words of Iras convinced all of them
The path to Erloria could be a safer way

Primordial in its reality

Shadows Of Death
The old elfking Tarish knows well the way
through the caverns
to Dar-Kunor's forgotten entrance
For two days they walked in the wild
on the pathway to darkness
the reason they survived it was Dargor
Finally they saw in the black and evil marsh
There lied the passageway between snakes and hellish mud

Then, when he appeared
they welcome him as heroes do.
he found the caves of the ancient brother elves

ANGELS OF LIGHT GIVE THEM THE FAITH
TIME NOW HAS COME
DAR-KUNOR AWAITS
Unknown threat - it fills the dry air
the howling of wolves fades behind them
they try to find rest between the wild rocks
the one they'll soon see can be their last dawn

whispers of death surround the wide marsh
Dar-Kunor is there to swallow their souls
in front of them another hell's gate

Holy Thunderforce
Face me evil bastards, smell the hate of angels
Glory, pride and bloodshed
Cowards and beholders, rapers of my wisdom
Mix of dust and bones
Go back to your abyss, Algalord will not fall
But your heads will soon roll
Test the blade of heroes, fury of the thunder
Hit my golden shield
So we'll fight against the wind 
for the glory of the kings
to defeat the evil enemies
And we'll ride with our lord 
for the power and the throne
in the name of holy thunderforce
Arwald and Aresius with the nordic warrior
On their way to Hargor
Chaos and oblivion, turmoil and disorder
Will have now their name
The last fallen heroes will defeat your forces
Thousand spirits calling
On the furthest mountain I will see your fire
Quenched by holy frost
So we'll fight against the wind 
for the glory of the kings
to defeat the evil enemies
And we'll ride with our lord 
for the power and the throne
in the name of holy thunderforce
Dargor, Shadowlord Of The Black Mountain (Extended)
Not so far from the wide dragonland
Where the valleys breathe the smell of dark gate
Dargor is marching with the poor Airin
There where dark has ruled forever for the demonknights
Fire's rising to valleys of death
While shadows are rising from bloody hells
Fire's riding to Hargor, the town
Where evil and terror conquered the clouds
We sing to the wind the legend of the king
To spread out heart to the kingdom of dust
Where heroes are lost, where now reigns the shadowlord
Carved in shadow is his magic throne
Kron disciple, not extreme at all
Gothic his kingdom told by old jesters
Pride and terror live together in his stormy heart
Fire's rising to valleys of death
While shadows are rising from bloody hells
Fire's riding to Hargor, the town
Where evil and terror conquered the clouds
We sing to the wind the legend of the king
To spread out heart to the kingdom of dust
Where heroes are lost, where now reigns the shadowlord
Cry with me to fill the crystal sea
Cry for all the victims of these stones
Shed your tears to fill the silent fall
And wash in it your soul
Fire's rising to valleys of death
While shadows are rising from bloody hells
Fire's riding to Hargor, the town
Where evil and terror conquered the clouds
We sing to the wind the legend of the king
To spread out heart to the kingdom of dust
Where heroes are lost, where now reigns the shadowlord

Guardians
We're living in our units
And one thing we can do is
Work for a life without a fate
We don't pay any taxes
But the state is the axes
Of our minds without love without hate
We have a higher order
No one needs to be a hoarder
Our society is such a glorious thing
In our centers we can dream of
Anything you never think of
You can't say we are puppets on a string
Our minds are kept so clean
Checked up on a screen
They're holy men, they're saints
Without them we might all fail
We don't know war and crime
Things of ancient times
We just see it if we put on video
The blue pass is for my life
And the red one's for my wife
It's the only thing we really need to show
There are still some without rules
But I tell you, they're all fools
The Guardians will find them as we've seen
We got banks where we freeze them
They get new brains screwed in then
And act contrarily to what they have been
With new minds made so clean
Checked up on a screen
They will be the saints
Without them we might all fail
Guardians of our lives
Protect security
They turn the key and they step in
Controlling you and me
Guardians of our lives
Take care eternally
The Dark Secret
It was a good time for all creatures on the earth,
But fate decreed that the dark prophecy of a demon
Knight could bring a tragic end to this peace
Scarring their lives forever.
Shortly before his defeat in the last of the primordial
Wars between the heavens and hells the evil son
Of the Hell God Kron, known as Nekron, withdrew
To his lair in the underworld. There sensing his
Impending death he inscribed a testament of pure evil
In seven black books. One by one six of these books
Were discovered through the ages, however the
Seventh, last and most terrible of all contained the
Secret of his resurrection.
He commanded seven immortal demons to carry out
His dark plan. But they were turned into stone by
The angels of the crystal realms. And so his dreams
Slept with them until a time came when the forces of
Evilevul would usurp the earth. Nekron would rule in the
Unholy name of cosmic chaos.
And this time he would reign supreme!
Ira divina
A dolore nunc libera nos
Tacet rota temporis
Nunc est silentium
Sempiternus angelus
A malo libera nos
A malo
Unholy Warcry
The dark lies a secret he is sworn to return to avenge the lost divine wars.
Algalord arise greater than before
Time of peace not of war
Shouts of freedom from the castle walls
Freedom in the land and hope for all
Hope for all
Into the silent dark forgotten
Caves of dark-Kunor
Deep in the secret book is awaiting
Unholy warcry
Nekron promised bloody terror
Bringing death and pain
To the new world
From the rocky mountains
To the golden sea
To the Barbarians' sacred hills
From the icy north and misty lakes
To the walls of Seth and Elvish plains
All beware!
Into the silent dark forgotten
Caves of dark-Kunor
Deep in the secret book is awaiting
Unholy warcry
Nekron promised bloody terror
Bringing death and pain
To the new world
Torment pain and bloody rain
Nekron's resurrection
They must kill the demon king
Or fight another war
"Nekron would rule
In the unholy name of cosmic chaos
And this time he would reign supreme"
He is Kron Kron's disciple
He is sworn to return
To avenge the lost devine wars
There was only one who knew the way
He lived in the dark lonely caves
The demon of the night
Could save the day
Should they take a change or run away
Dargor was his name!
Into the silent dark forgotten
Caves of dark-Kunor
Deep in the secret book is awaiting
Unholy warcry
Now they swore to band together
On a sacred journey
Called by fate time to be great
Unholy warcry
Nekron promised bloody terror
Bringing death and pain
To the new world
Wisdom Of The Kings
Removed the stones which hide the cave
Blind and dark along my way
I must go on wise and brave before a last hail
At the end of floor stairs of ancient stone
Lead me to a vision, an unreal hall
And they appear in front of me
Lightened by a mystic flame
A new dimension I have to face beyond the gates
I can not believe on what now I see
When the two demons awake from the sleep
Holy dragons keepers of time
Ride brave the blue skies and spell my eyes
Fly beyond these hills ride on the wind
The wisdom of the kings
Lost in a dream I'm under the spell
Of the sunny magic land
But Aresius said: become aware! all can hide the hell...
Now it's time to go to the mighty sword
It's time to follow the kings holy call
Holy dragons keepers of time
Ride brave the blue skies and spell my eyes
Fly beyond these hills ride on the wind
The wisdom of the kings
The Village Of Dwarves
The dwarves of Lark are showing all their honour
When you walk on the Gandor secret hill
The dance for fire and wind
And the stories about old kings
Are pleasing our brave lords
Down in the village of dwarves
The elves are playing under timeless willows
While blue and red paint all my beloved land
The dance for fire and wind
And the stories about old kings
Are pleasing our brave lords
Down in the village of dwarves
The eagle's eye is hiding something tragic
But in this night the red wine rules in me
The dance for fire and wind
And the stories about old kings
Are pleasing our brave lords
Down in the village of dwarves
And all night long me Arwald and Aresius
We speak, we laugh, we honor our king
The dance for fire and wind
And the stories about old kings
Are pleasing our brave lords
Down in the village of dwarves
The eagle's eye is hiding something tragic
But in this night the red wine rules in me
The dance for fire and wind
And the stories about old kings
Are pleasing our brave lords
Down in the village of dwarves
And time has come now to ride
Before the end of the night
The march of the swordmaster
To the unholy fight
And time has come now to ride
Before the end of the night
The march of the swordmaster
To the unholy fight
Unholy fight
Unholy fight
Erian's Mystical Rhymes
In Primordial times of sorrow
Ancient ages of the known world
Kron's reign of terror was rising
So the skylords sent their angels
Against the storm that threatened heavens
Seven wars were so fought
The dead rose
Led by the darklords of hell
The last war
Meant the end
Of hellgod's
Old reign
Dark memories lost in the shades of illusion
Warn the light of electric sky
The angels could change the life on earth
But not the demons' old plans
United force of stron wise men...
A new order soon was born
Ten kings, ten wizards, elves and dragonlords
Ready to fight for their world
Ready to face the last secret
Hidden for 5angels' years
5years
A great and new hope in Elgard was born
The one hope that could finally find the
Sacred words to stop the dark plan of Nekron
All contained in Erian's mystical white book
The holy council cast their vote
Hearing the deep voice of soul
Etherus... Iras... two names on all
Elected to face the darklord
They knew so well Erian's tale
What could be found between his rhymes
His rhymes of divine light
Written to save our lands
Ready to face the last secret
Hidden for 5angels' years
5years
Now is the time for them to share all their plans
The one hope that could finally find the
Sacred words to stop the dark plan of Nekron
All contained in Erian's mystical white book
So the name was chosen
White Dragon's Order
All sworn to fight
All for one
One for all
A great and new hope in Elgard was born
The one hope that could finally find the
Sacred words to stop the dark plan of Nekron
All contained in Erian's mystical white book
Sacred words to stop the dark plan of Nekron
All contained in Erian's mystical white book
Dawn Of Victory
Fire is raging on the battlefield
While Arwald is fighting the war of the kings
The army of Dargor, the thunder, the storm...
So people are calling the brave and his sword
No time left to save the wise throne!
Shades of a past not so far to forget...
The rise of the demons from their bloody Hell!
So come mighty warrior to light the lost hope
For Tharos the dragon and your cosmic soul...
Now handle your emerald sword!
For Ancelot
The ancient cross of war
For the holy town of gods
Gloria, gloria perpetua
In this dawn of victory
The ride of the dead and their practice of pain
Is pounding in him as a terrific quake
You're closer and closer now follow their smell
With your holy armour the steel in your hand
Fly angel of bloody revenge!
For Ancelot
The ancient cross of war
For the holy town of gods
Gloria, gloria perpetua
In this dawn of victory
Tragic and furious the clash of the steel of the gods
And so magic the power, the sword in his valorous hands
Oceans of fire are blasting the throne of the demons
And from distant red skies the thunders are calling his name
The name of the master of pain!
For Ancelot
The ancient cross of war
For the holy town of gods
Gloria, gloria perpetua
In this dawn of victory
Gloria, gloria perpetua
In this dawn of victory
Nightfall On The Grey Mountains
Holy angels of eternal light
You who fell in the primordial age
Between these dark and grey lonely mountains
Who died to protect the green of the earth
For Algalord and Elgard, Thorald and Elnor
For all the towns of the known world
For the icy northlands, the waterfalls' kingdom
The dwarves' western realms and the whole middle lands
Cold mystic night - it falls on the plane
On the grey mountains reigns now the shade
Angels of light give them the faith
Time now has come
Dar-Kunor awaits
Unknown threat - it fills the dry air
The howling of wolves fades behind them
They try to find rest between the wild rocks
The one they'll soon see can be their last dawn
The angels' lament breaths in the cold winds
Whispers of death surround the wide marsh
Dar-Kunor is there to swallow their souls
In front of them another hell's gate
Cold mystic night - it falls on the plane
On the grey mountains reigns now the shade
Angels of light give them the faith
Time now has come
Dar-Kunor awaits
March Of The Swordmaster
Ride... die... sacrifice!
Along the river of bloody tears
The mighty steel shining in my hands
We march and honor our brothers
Victims of Kron's evil plan
We cross the lakes of the holy woods
To reach the ocean where red waves rule
The black king is moving to Algalord
This is the time... he has to be stopped!
Hail, Hail!
...Brave Swordmaster!
March, March!
...Great Swordmaster!
And I ask the wind for the fall of the king...!
Into the ray of the sun
March our hero hunting the darklord
Reborn from the blood of his God...
His God... the warmaster Kron
Ride for the fall of his power
Fighting the storm, the roar of the thunder
Ally of the sun and the moon...
Great swordmaster rule!
Between the waves of the raging sea
Echoes of warcries and battle hymns
The underworld's armies found their ancient queen
The funeral march in the depths of the abyss
The terror which strikes, the honor which prays
Will be face to face in the mortal doomsday
Resist my fierce soldiers their vision can kill
It will test your courage... and your will to live
Hail, Hail!
...Brave Swordmaster!
March, March!
...Great Swordmaster!
And I ask the wind for the fall of the king...!
Into the ray of the sun
March our hero hunting the darklord
Reborn from the blood of his God...
His God... the warmaster Kron
Ride for the fall of his power
Fighting the storm, the roar of the thunder
Ally of the sun and the moon...
Great swordmaster rule!
Into the ray of the sun
March our hero hunting the darklord
Reborn from the blood of his God...
His God... the warmaster Kron
Ride for the fall of his power
Fighting the storm, the roar of the thunder
Ally of the sun and the moon...
Great swordmaster rule!
Into the ray of the sun
March our hero hunting the darklord
Reborn from the blood of his God...
His God... the warmaster Kron
Ride for the fall of his power
Fighting the storm, the roar of the thunder
Ally of the sun and the moon...
Great swordmaster rule!
To avenge all those cries I will rise to the sky
To defend mother life...
Ride... die... sacrifice!
Emerald Sword
I crossed the valleys the dust of midlands
To search for the third key to open the gates
Now I'm near the altar the secret inside
As legend told my beloved sun light the dragons eyes
On the way to the glory I'll honour my sword
To serve right ideals and justice for all
Finally happened the sun lit their eyes
The spell was creating strange games of light
Thanks to hidden mirrors I found my lost way
Over the stones I reached the place it was a secret cave
In a long bloody battle that prophecies told
The light will prevail hence wisdom is gold
For the king for the land for the mountains
For the green valleys where dragons fly
For the glory the power to win the black lord
I will search for the emerald sword
Only a warrior with a clear heart
Could have the honour to be kissed by the sun
Yes, I'm that warrior I followed my way
Led by the force of cosmic soul I can reach the sword
On the way to the glory I'll honour my sword
To serve right ideals and justice for all
For the king for the land for the mountains
For the green valleys where dragons fly
For the glory the power to win the black lord
I will search for the emerald sword

Elnor's Magic Valley
The Poem's Evil Page
The silent willows keep the ancient stone
hidden behind that cryptic door
Rituals of terror quake all the ghostland
the bloody line now paints the cold floor
The evil pages are almost written
with the dark poison of flesh and bones
Fire is raining on the grey mountains
Waters are waiting for the last oath
The way is open... now they are coming
called by the blasphemous words of the lord
...and finally the violet waves announce their arrival
and blood will soon be painting the beloved lamenting
ocean...
The way is open... now they are coming
called by the words... the words of the lord
Ethereal harmonies spread trough all the air...
the unreal calm before Elnor's end...

Your blade is now serving the dark force...

WIZARD'S LAST HOLY SIGHTS... / THE WIZARD'S LAST
RHYMES
We are reaching the brutal, the tragic dimension
led by reflections, reflections of death
the ghost in the fog... wander lamenting
while violence devours my wasted brain
Let me... awake!
The astral bewitchment is the fatal witness
of created surge of chaos
I reflect the constellations' fall
Now close your eyes and fight blind
The moon is dying, don't fear his might
QUANDO CORPUS MORIETUR FAC UT ANIMAE
DONETUR / Starless is my night, silent is my ride
trough the paradox of wishdom... to the sea of souls
FIRE IS BLAZING FAST ACROSS THE BLOODY RED SEA
THE SUNLIGHT IS FADING ON HIM / THESE ARE THE
WIZARD'S LAST HOLY SIGHTS... / THE POEM'S TRAGIC
RHYMES
Fierce blows the wind, infinite fires
on Elnor sea... hail to the king!
He died as brave, oh valiant hero
but so in vain, facing the storm... the storm!
And soon the snakes of the abyss
swallowed the mighty woodship
while the waves of the bloody ocean
were reaching the walls of the falling town...
Starless is my night, silent is my ride
trough the paradox of wishdom... to the sea of souls
Nel silenzio tragiche realta'...
FIRE IS BLAZING FAST ACROSS THE BLOODY RED SEA
THE SUNLIGHT IS FADING ON HIM / THESE ARE THE
WIZARD'S LAST HOLY SIGHTS... / THE POEM'S TRAGIC

Rage Of The Winter (Symphonic Version)
Cold is the winter snow falls down

Spell of the nature fill all my soul

Rage of the winter mould the horizon

Rage of the winter magical wonder
enchanted fury majestic force
There are no words to describe the poetry of landscape

Tears of the winter falling on me freezing my dark side
my heart must be wide fair full light eyes
Rage of the winter mould the horizon
cover the mountains forest and lakes

Forest Of Unicorns
Run holy beloved horse
on this peaceful day
through these valleys kissed by light
where peace is so rare
So hardy trees let me hear your words
about those memories
please tell me all about our hold
and epic battles they won
Beware of unholy fire
my guardian of the trees
their flames can't burn the memory
the wisdom of the kings
The secret of this forest
the ride of unicorns
are treasures of these valleys
where freedom has its throne
where love must reign eternally
avoiding acts of war
We must have all their valour
to defend these lands
or the sun in these valleys
will not shine again
Beware of unholy fire
my guardian of the trees
their flames can't burn the memory
the wisdom of the kings
The secret of this forest
the ride of unicorns
are treasures of these valleys
where freedom has its throne
where love must reign eternally
avoiding acts of war
Land Of Immortals (Remix)
Hear the silence of the winds making your own destiny
go and face the mirror of their sin
Only brave hearts found the way breaking all the dragon's spell
cross the Argon's glade with heart in hand
Land of immortals I wait for my day
to reach the wisdom of your skies
Land of immortals you must belong to me
from here to eternity
And between Elgard's hills near the ancient ruins of Kron
you will face the trick of the old dwarf
To obtain the second key you have to cross the bloody sea
where the thirst of Tharos never ends
Land of immortals I wait for my day
to reach the wisdom of your skies
Land of immortals you must belong to me
from here to eternity
Holy force of wisdom spread through all the air
I shall breathe you forever to end this epic holy quest
My way will be hard but I would do all
to reach the valleys where true heroes ride beyond the ivory gates
Land of immortals I wait for my day
to reach the wisdom of your skies
Land of immortals you must belong to me
from here to eternity
Emerald Sword
I crossed the valleys the dust of midlands
to search for the third key to open the gates
Now I'm near the altar the secret inside
As legend told my beloved sun light the dragons eyes
On the way to the glory I'll honour my sword
to serve right ideals and justice for all
Finally happened the sun lit their eyes
the spell was creating strange games of light
Thanks to hidden mirrors I found my lost way
over the stones I reached the place it was a secret cave
In a long bloody battle that prophecies told
the light will prevail hence wisdom is gold
For the king for the land for the mountains
for the green valleys where dragons fly
for the glory the power to win the black lord
I will search for the emerald sword
Only a warrior with a clear heart
could have the honour to be kissed by the sun
Yes, I'm that warrior I followed my way
led by the force of cosmic soul I can reach the sword
On the way to the glory I'll honour my sword
to serve right ideals and justice for all
For the king for the land for the mountains
for the green valleys where dragons fly
for the glory the power to win the black lord
I will search for the emerald sword
Wisdom Of The Kings
Removed the stones which hide the cave
blind and dark along my way
I must go on wise and brave before a last hail
At the end of floor stairs of ancient stone
lead me to a vision, an unreal hall
And they appear in front of me
lightened by a mystic flame
A new dimension I have to face beyond the gates
I can not believe on what now I see
when the two demons awake from the sleep
Holy dragons keepers of time
ride brave the blue skies and spell my eyes
fly beyond these hills ride on the wind
the wisdom of the kings
Lost in a dream I'm under the spell
of the sunny magic land
But Aresius said: become aware! all can hide the hell...
Now it's time to go to the mighty sword
it's time to follow the kings holy call
Holy dragons keepers of time
ride brave the blue skies and spell my eyes
fly beyond these hills ride on the wind
the wisdom of the kings
Wings Of Destiny
Day has gone but I'm still here with you
my sweet rose my green hills
beloved sea, lakes and sky
beloved mother earth
Silent land erase my thoughts
I wanna lose myself in you, all in you
caress me and my soul while I close my eyes
On wings of destiny
through virgin skies
to far horizons I will fly
Dear peaceful land, dear mother earth
caress my soul while I close my eyes
On wings of destiny
through virgin skies
to far horizons I will fly
Riding The Winds Of Eternity
Wise and mighty you are force of the earth
Fierce becomes the sea at your command
Winds of the south winds of the north
let me hear your call
Blow on my heart filling my soul
give me the force of the storm
For all of the time I will ride be my guide
I will follow your sign for a just life
Winds of the south winds of the north
let me hear your call
Blow on my heart filling my soul
give me the force of the storm
Riding the holy winds, winds of eternity
I'll fight you forever nightmares sons
Dawn Of Victory
Fire is raging on the battlefield
while Arwald is fighting the war of the kings
The army of Dargor, the thunder, the storm...
so people are calling the brave and his sword
No time left to save the wise throne!
Shades of a past not so far to forget...
the rise of the demons from their bloody Hell!
So come mighty warrior to light the lost hope
for Tharos the dragon and your cosmic soul...
Now handle your emerald sword!
For Ancelot
the ancient cross of war
for the holy town of gods
Gloria, gloria perpetua
in this dawn of victory
The ride of the dead and their practice of pain
is pounding in him as a terrific quake
You're closer and closer now follow their smell
with your holy armour the steel in your hand
Fly angel of bloody revenge!
For Ancelot
the ancient cross of war
for the holy town of gods
Gloria, gloria perpetua
in this dawn of victory
Tragic and furious the clash of the steel of the gods
and so magic the power, the sword in his valorous hands
Oceans of fire are blasting the throne of the demons
and from distant red skies the thunders are calling his name
the name of the master of pain!
For Ancelot
the ancient cross of war
for the holy town of gods
Gloria, gloria perpetua
in this dawn of victory
Holy Thunderforce (Remix)
Face me evil bastards, smell the hate of angels
Glory, pride and bloodshed
Cowards and beholders, rapers of my wisdom
mix of dust and bones
Go back to your abyss, Algalord will not fall
but your heads will soon roll
Test the blade of heroes, fury of the thunder
hit my golden shield
So we'll fight against the wind for the glory of the kings
to defeat the evil enemies
And we'll ride with our lord for the power and the throne
in the name of holy thunderforce
Arwald and Aresius with the nordic warrior
on their way to Hargor
Chaos and oblivion, turmoil and disorder
will have now their name
The last fallen heroes will defeat your forces
Thousands spirits calling
On the furthest mountain I will see your fire
quenched by holy frost!
So we'll fight against the wind for the glory of the kings
to defeat the evil enemies
And we'll ride with our lord for the power and the throne
in the name of holy thunderforce
Face me evil bastards, smell the hate of angels
Glory, pride and bloodshed
Cowards and beholders, rapers of my wisdom
mix of dust and bones
Go back to your abyss, Algalord will not fall
but your heads will soon roll
Test the blade of heroes, fury of the thunder
hit my golden shield
So we'll fight against the wind for the glory of the kings
to defeat the evil enemies
And we'll ride with our lord for the power and the throne
in the name of holy thunderforce
So we'll fight against the wind for the glory of the kings
to defeat the evil enemies
And we'll ride with our lord for the power and the throne
in the name of holy thunderforce
So we'll fight against the wind for the glory of the kings
to defeat the evil enemies
And we'll ride with our lord for the power and the throne
in the name of holy thunderforce
The Village Of Dwarves
The dwarves of Lork are showing all their honour
when you walk on the Gandor secret hill
The dance for fire and wind
and the stories about old kings
are pleasing our brave lords
down in the village of dwarves
The elves are playing under timeless willows
while blue and red paint all my beloved land
The dance for fire and wind
and the stories about old kings
are pleasing our brave lords
down in the village of dwarves
The eagle's eye is hiding something tragic
but in this night the red wine rules in me
The dance for fire and wind
and the stories about old kings
are pleasing our brave lords
down in the village of dwarves
And all night long me Arwald and Aresius
we speak, we laugh, we honor our king
The dance for fire and wind
and the stories about old kings
are pleasing our brave lords
down in the village of dwarves
The eagle's eye is hiding something tragic
but in this night the red wine rules in me
The dance for fire and wind
and the stories about old kings
are pleasing our brave lords
down in the village of dwarves
And time has come now to ride
before the end of the night
the march of the swordmaster
to the unholy fight
And time has come now to ride
before the end of the night
the march of the swordmaster
to the unholy fight
Unholy fight
Unholy fight
Rain Of A Thousand Flames
DIES IRAE
REGNA NELL' OSCURITA'
Guardians of the moonlight bring the spell alive
trought the sphere of sorrow lead my holy ride
Titans of the desert face the warlord's pride
fighters from the near lakes join the tragic night
War of the ghostland take your souls
but give us freedom once and for all
...firestorm!
UNDER THE RAIN OF A THOUSAND FLAMES
WE FACE THE REAL PAIN FALLING IN VAIN
WHILE THE DARK ANGEL SCREAMS FOR VENGEANCE
IN THE DEAD SHADOW OF FALLING STARS
Silent cries of virgins touch the heart of night
raped by the demons under painful sights
Sperm and blood and terror chaos in my head
Is the law of evil triumph for the damned
War of the ghostland take your souls
but give us freedom once and for all
...firestorm!
UNDER THE RAIN OF A THOUSAND FLAMES
WE FACE THE REAL PAIN FALLING IN VAIN
WHILE THE DARK ANGEL SCREAMS FOR VENGEANCE
IN THE DEAD SHADOW OF FALLING STARS
...Moonlight is the witness of the most tragic day for our lands...
nothing seems possible to change the destiny of war...
Lament of heroes reach the deep skies
fill the wide cosmos and free my pain... my pain!
UNDER THE RAIN OF A THOUSAND FLAMES
WE FACE THE REAL PAIN FALLING IN VAIN
WHILE THE DARK ANGEL SCREAMS FOR VENGEANCE
IN THE DEAD SHADOW
OF FALLING STARS
DIES IRAE
Knightrider Of Doom
The fading illusion the sirens' grey tears
it's here in the cold air the town's tragic fear
The breath of infernos the rise of the dead
the portals of chaos the seventh black flame
IN THIS BLOODY DAWN
I WILL WASH MY SOUL
TO CALL THE SPIRIT OF VENGEANCE
TO DENY MY WISDOM FOR ANGER
TO BREAK THE SCREAM OF THE SILENT FOOL
AND TO BE THE SON OF DOOM...
IN THIS BLOOD DAWN
I WILL WASH MY SOUL
TO CALL THE SPIRIT OF VENGEANCE
TO DENY MY WISDOM FOR ANGER
TO BREAK THE SCREAM OF THE SILENT FOOL
TO BE A KNIGHTRIDER OF DOOM...
The rites of the unborn the dragonship's fall
the waves of my ocean the twins' holy call
The march of the heroes the call of the gods
after the rituals on the silent shore
IN THIS BLOODY DAWN
I WILL WASH MY SOUL
TO CALL THE SPIRIT OF VENGEANCE
TO DENY MY WISDOM FOR ANGER
TO BREAK THE SCREAM OF THE SILENT FOOL
AND TO BE THE SON OF DOOM...
IN THIS BLOODY DAWN
I WILL WASH MY SOUL
TO CALL THE SPIRIT OF VENGEANCE
TO DENY MY WISDOM FOR ANGER
TO BREAK THE SCREAM OF THE SILENT FOOL
TO BE A KNIGHTRIDER OF DOOM...
March Of The Swordmaster
Ride... die... sacrifice!
Along the river of bloody tears
the mighty steel shining in my hands
we march and honor our brothers
victims of Kron's evil plan
We cross the lakes of the holy woods
to reach the ocean where red waves rule
the black king is moving to Algalord
this is the time... he has to be stopped!
HAIL, HAIL!
...Brave Swordmaster!
MARCH, MARCH!
...Great Swordmaster!
and I ask the wind for the fall of the king...!
INTO THE RAY OF THE SUN
MARCH OUR HERO HUNTING THE DARKLORD
REBORN FROM THE BLOOD OF HIS GOD...
HIS GOD... THE WARMASTER KRON
RIDE FOR THE FALL OF HIS POWER
FIGHTING THE STORM, THE ROAR OF THE THUNDER
ALLY OF THE SUN AND THE MOON...
GREAT SWORDMASTER RULE!
Between the waves of the raging sea
echoes of warcries and battle hymns
the underworld's armies found their ancient queen
the funeral march in the depths of the abyss
The terror which strikes the honor which prays
will be face to face in the mortal doomsday
Resist my fierce soldiers their vision can kill
it will test your courage... and your will to live
HAIL, HAIL!
...Brave Swordmaster!
MARCH, MARCH!
...Great Swordmaster!
and I ask the wind for the fall of the king...!

To avenge all those cries I will rise to the sky
to defend mother life...
Ride... die... sacrifice!
Power Of The Dragonflame
Rise mighty dragon...
Rise, rise, rise, rise...
Mighty dragon rise!
Ruins of ancient wisdom closing now my darkest lonely eye
god is dead in Thorald and in Elnor's rhyme
Mutilated bodies are now carved in ancient holy stone
tragic decoration of unholy wars
The heart of the dragon is screaming awaiting
to write the black last page
The page of blood was written by them...
the dead now lying on the sand
Visions of disaster are now challenging the
wild storms
cyclops of the midlands wash my bloody shore
Sirens from the open seas now heal my broken wounded brain
I call the holy typhoons... air, fire, earth!
The heart of the dragon is screaming awaiting
to write the black last page
The poem of blood was written by them...
the dead now lying on the sand
FROM THE SILENT HILL WE SCREAM LOUD YOUR NAME
MIGHTY POWER OF THE DRAGONFLAME
FROM THE MOUNTAINS PROUD AND STRONG
WE CALL OUR DRAGONLORD
Mighty dragon rise... rise!
Energie di cosmi estinti gridano sangue
dalle terre dell'ignoto senza pieta'
The heart of the dragon is screaming awaiting
to write the black last page
The poem of blood was written by them...
the dead now on the sand
FROM THE SILENT HILL WE SCREAM LOUD YOUR NAME
MIGHTY POWER OF THE DRAGONFLAME
FROM THE MOUNTAINS PROUD AND STRONG
WE CALL OUR DRAGONLORD

"It was a good time for 
all creatures of the earth, 
but fate decreed that the dark 
prophecy of a demonknight 
could bring a tragic end to this peace 
scarring their lives forever!
Only one person could cross the 
Darklands surrounding Hargor 
and venture forth deep into 
the caves of Dark-Kunor. 
His is a name the world will never forget,
he is Dargor."
The dark lies a secret he is sworn to return to avenge the lost divine wars.
