As his life's blood leaving
I hold my son, my only son
And tears fill my burning eyes

While his skin turns pale as snow
Butchered he lies here bleeding in my arms
Slewn by the men of the single god
Hatred burns in my chest

Rain falls from a raging heaven
The wind howls like wolves at the moon
I will seek my vengeance for my son
I swear I'll avenge my first born one
I ride fast through the woods
My friends are by my side
Dark hatred burns in my eyes
"Slaves of hvitekrist today you die!"

"Mäktiga gudar,
i gyllene salen.
Hjälp mig i striden
mot sondräparna,
Den höge skall
för huggen hämnas
och blod skall gäldas
i blod"

Our cloaks fly in the wind
As we ride in the cold dark night
We're closing in our enemies
We rage in our hearts burning bright

The clouds scatter in the northern wind
A full moon rides the pitch black sky
"Now, hounds of Hvitekrist,
your time has come to die!"

"Kneel before my sword!
No mercy! Your time has come to die!
This is the ride for vengeance!"


2. The Dragon's Flight Across The Waves


Alone he stands in the doorway
His family still asleep
Gazing at the starlit horizon
And the moonsparkling sea
When dawn comes he must leave them
His home, his children and loved
For his destiny beyond those waves
Known only to the Norns

He's already dressed ready to leave
His four friends are waiting by the shore
Each with a dragon ship
And one hundred men prepared for war

He returns to his bed kissing
His sleeping wife goodbye
And as he leaves his youngest son
A tear rolls from his eye

They set sail with the first morning rays
Heading for glorious wars
And as the five ships steer out from the bay
Their hearts pound like never before

The wind is strong, the sun is warm
Their Dragons fly across the waves
No greenfaces are seen here onboard
Only a crowd of braves

Many nights pass
And days long as a year
They await the battle
They await without fear

On the morning of the fifth day
Before the sun arose
They hear bells chime and see pyres
Torched at a nearby coast

"LOWER THE SAIL, GRAB YOUR OARS,
NOW MEN IT'S TIME TO ACT!
ROW LIKE THE WIND TO THE SHORE,
ROW LIKE THE WIND TO ATTACK!"


3. Without Fear


I see
Without fear my destiny
As the raging skies begins to fade
Pouring rain
Licks my wounds as my blood flows
From my torn flesh!

As I die
I hold my sword
My only friend
And pray that Oden
Will take me home

The battle rages
But I hear only raindrops falling
Like in slow motion to the ground

Death release me
Free me from my earthly pain
Oden I ask thee please
Take me home

Without fear I die!

As I look
To the sky the heaven is lit
And Valkyries in shining armour
Descend

I rest my head
On the ground
And close my eyes
I know that Oden's sent for me
As I die

Without fear I die
I hold my sword
And die
Without fear


4. Victorious March


Ten heavy feet
Walk the bloodsoiled ground
With rhythm these
Five warriors march

No matter how much
The bleeding wounds
From enemy swordcuts
Hurt to the bone

The revenge they sought
Was taken in blood
No mercy was showed
No mercy was showed

They ignore the pain
That hammerlike pounds
From falls, off slain horses,
To the ground

No signs of weakness
No signs of weariness
Not even a glimpse
Of remorse in their eyes

They slew men ruthless
Fed the wolves with flesh
And now they leave
This land side by side

Now they're headed home
Five swordsmen who fought repentlessly
Their story will be told
Of five brave men endlessly

All sorrow is left
For the women to bare
The children cries
They live in fear

No man was spared
No house or farm remains
No christian woman unraped
Their church consumed by flames

Their steel shines red
With enemy blood
It sings of victory
Granted by the Gods
And as they return
Bleeding but proud
The horizon burns
And the song is ringing loud


5. Friends Of The Suncross


Salt water licks my face
and wind fills the sail
We head for wars on distant shores

My friends are all with me
And so they'll always be
We'll never bend untill the end

We cross the open waves
On course to far off lands
Thor guides our ships
With his strong hands

Across the waves our seasnakes fly
Carried like ravens in the sky
By heavens breath on wings of death

Blood will run red
As we sever bodies from their heads
We maim and kill by pure will

We hail our Gods
Sacrifice in blood
Our altar is the battlefields

Death is something we don't fear
Though it's always near
Ygg brings us home when time has come

We are five of us
Friends of the suncross
Strong and brave to the grave!


6. Abandoned


They came riding down the slopes
Five fearless men prepared to fight
We heard with fear the rumbling earth
In the mid-day light

Surprised we saw all terrified
The brave northmen's run
The fearless five with power ride
Attacking us in the mid-day sun

Their charge was fast, no alarm was sound
They broke right through our lines
I felt the cut it threw me to the ground
And now I feel has come my time

I lie here in my blood
And see my family get killed
I feel abandoned by my god
I fear death's chill

I see Hel's gates
Towering high
And dark are they
I don't want to die

Oh no! I was wrong
Denied the true gods
And now I'm doomed
I trusted foreign men
And their god's son
But now when I need them
They are gone

I see Hel's gates
Towering high
And dark are they
I die!

They ride across the planes
And punish those of false belief
All resistance is in vain
As they caress them with cold steel

They are the punishers
And they will never bend
They are power the five of them
From Asgard they are sent

The power they have in all they do
The Christians non will feel
No one can escape them no
They will make them kneel

Their fight is through, they must return
No one here survived
And as the blood red sky begins to burn
To Valhall they will ride


7. Amon Amarth


A storm rolls in from the sea
Covering the land with black thunder clouds
Rain whips the ground at their feet
As they come ashore in this foreign land

Thunder brakes the silence
Of fivehundred men assembled ashore
Gazing through the misty rain
At the mountain not a mile away
So dark and silent it stands there
The mighty AMON AMARTH
Reaching for the cloudcloked skies
So grim and fearful in might

With the wind in their backs they start walking
Decisive men of the north
They strive through this darkened land
With only mount doom in their sight
The closer they get to the mountain
The clearer their eyes can see
A forest of one thousand spears awaiting
Awaiting the battle that will be

A cry of war emerges
Echoes over the field
Warriors run, like wolves up the sloaps
Boldley charging the enemy lines

With weapons so fearsome and sharp in their hands
And shields of oakwood and steel
They slit open stomachs and split skulls to the jaw
Intestants cover the field

The defenders are weak in this brutal war
The northmen have power and guts
A bloodshed like no one has seen here before
None can escape their cuts

Arrows with fire fly through the air
Touching houses and shields
The Vikings can feel victory is near
As the enemy headlessly flees

A gust of wind blows in from the north
Clearing the clouds away
As twilight falls and the stars come forth
And the seawolves return to the bay

Corpses lie scattered all over the field
For the ravens to eat as they please
The mountain is now left there behind
As they sail with the first morning breeze


8. Once Sent From The Golden Hall


Rumbling thunder cracks the sky
And rain starts pouring down
Lightning strikes a cold bright light
Upon the blooddrenched ground

The sword play is hard
And many fall
Steel bites sharp in flesh
And upon a mountain
Towering tall
Stand the messengers of death

Five horsemen in armour bright
Waiting in the flashing light
Looking down upon the field
Where Vikings fight with axe and shield

On stallions black as night
With eyes burning red
They ride with thunder to the fight
Deliverance of certain death

A warcry loud as Heimdall's horne
Echoes across the land
Enemies who hear it freeze to the bone
Friends of doom proudly stand

They ride faster than the wind
With lightning speed they strike
Black ravens follow where they've been
To feed from those who died

With power they wield their swords
As they ride down fleeing men
Sending them to Hel's dark court
To never come back again

The warriors ride once more
To the mountain from which they came
Once sent by the gods to war
And they never return in shame
