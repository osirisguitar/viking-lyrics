Rising up to reek havoc on this land
A beast straight from hell with burning steel in hand
White heat, blinding lights as the molten lava flows
Total devastation as the power hammer blows

Burning anvil of steel
Cast by demons that dwell
Burning anvil of steel
Forged in the furnace of hell

Hammered down, a crushing force of weight
Razor sharp feel the metal penetrate
Grinding pain, the sparks that rip and blind
As Armageddon is brought upon mankind

Burning anvil of steel
Cast by demons that dwell
Burning anvil of steel
Forged in the furnace of hell

Burning!
Burning!
Burning anvil of steel!
Burning!
Burning!
Burning anvil of steel!

Burning anvil of steel
Cast by the demons that dwell
Burning anvil of steel
Forged in the furnace of hell


2. Satan Rising


In the deep and darkest forest
Night has reached its final hour
Pagans dance 'round brimstone fires
Lucifer comes to call

Evil rites are getting higher
Spinning fast hands to the sky
Unholy chants around the pyre
Heathens call, "Satan" they cry

Sacrificial rites
From the trees a blood-rain's falling
The end of all mankind
Satan stirs; he's heard their calling

From the underworld
Comes the beast arising
Demons gather to behold
From the shadows Satan's rising


3. Snake Eyes


Life is just a lottery
No matter how you choose
But that has never bothered me
'cause I was born to lose

It doesn't matter what the cost
You know I won't give in
And I don't care about the odds
Because I play to win

[Chorus:]
You know I am a gambling man
And I have paid the price
Luck has never graced my hand
When I roll the dice
Snake eyes!

I trust the way I live my life
The choices that I make
To the rolling of the dice
No matter what's at stake

Some will call me fatalist
And some will call me freak
But hidden in my throwing fist
The fortune that I seek

You know I am a gambling man
And I have paid the price
Luck has never graced my hand
When I roll the dice
Snake eyes!

I caught your eye in a New York bar
You were looking down at me
An angel in black measuring in
At just over seven feet

Some fellas like their women short
Some fellas like 'em round
But me I like the kind of girl
That makes me stand up to go down!

Stand up! To go down!
No man will throw her around
Stand up! To go down!
When we make out I can't reach the ground

We took a cab, you got in the back
But the front seat had to come out
The car shook, the car bounced
As you ground me pound for pound
But back at your place you took the reins
And saddled up, you rode me around
And just as I reached the finish line
You made me stand up to go down!

Stand up! To go down!
No man will throw her around
Stand up! To go down!
When we make out I can't reach the ground

Stand up! To go down!
I'm going down but I'm upward bound
Stand up! To go down!
In a crowd she's easily found
Stand up! To go down!
No man is gonna throw her around
Stand up! To go down!
When we make out I can't reach the ground
