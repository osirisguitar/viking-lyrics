Ascension
Heaven
Look towards the sea,
Tell me what do you see?
Will you know what it is when you've found it?
You searched high above and you searched far below
But it still seems so far and you know it
Time - It dwindles away
There's a clock on the wall
And it seems that is calling your name
But you can't run away
He'll be right there behind you
Reminding you it's not a game
I will conquer the beast and I'll swim the seven seas
And my heart will still beat and I'll never give up
I will walk desert plains and endure gruelling pain
And my heart will still beat and I'll never give up
Heaven is a heartbeat away for your dreams of
Tomorrow could end today
Heaven is a heartbeat away for your dreams of
Tomorrow could end today.
Rise Again
Heat from the ground feeds the fire
My desire to live with this rage
With thoughts of you filling my nights
And my days...
Sounds of the speaking of tongues
Visions of circles undone
Keeps this heart of mine beating
For the time of our meeting will come
Now, I turn to the gods
Whichever will listen
From below or above
Hear my cry,
Feel my pain
If I should fall,
I'll start over again
Hear my cry,
Feel my pain
If I should die,
I will rise again
I scream to the sky full of anger
My body increasingly weaker
I won't die for you
I won't die for you
Heaven is a heartbeat away
Hear my cry,
Feel my pain
If I should fall,
I'll start over again
Hear my cry,
Feel my pain
If I should Die,
I will rise again.
One Day I'll Win
ONE DAY I'LL WIN
ONE DAY I'LL WIN
ONE DAY YOU WILL SEE
ONE DAY I'LL WIN
ONE DAY I'LL WIN
FOR I WISH IT TO BE
AND THEN YOU WILL SEE
ONE DAY I'LL WIN
LOOK IN MY EYES
YOU'LL SEE A DIFFERENT PART OF ME
HEAR MY WORDS SPEAK
YOU'LL HEAR A DIFFERENT PART OF ME
YES I KNOW I'M A SIMPLE MAN
YES I KNOW IT'S A COMPLEX LAND
IF I TELL MYSELF I CAN IF I DREAM
THEREFORE I AM
OH LORD, PLEASE HEAR ME OH LORD,
PLEASE HEAR MY SONG
IT'S ALL I OWN, IT'S ALL I OWN
LOOK IN MY EYES
YOU'LL SEE A DIFFERENT PART OF ME
HEAR MY WORDS SPEAK
YOU'LL HEAR A DIFFERENT PART OF ME
We Are Not Separate
LAUNCH THE SILVER SPEAR
THE WORLD WILL CRY A TEAR
IN THE HEAVENS WILL APPEAR ANOTHER ANGEL
HEAR THE ELDERS CRY
WAITING FOR THEIR TIME
AS THEY LOOK TOWARDS THE HEAVENS
WHY WON'T THEY ANSWER?
WE ARE PLAYING WITH NATURE
SPLITTING THE ATOM
CONFUSING RELIGIONS
KILLING THE MASSES
WE ARE NOT SEPARATE FROM WHAT WE DESTROY
TIME HAS COME FOR US TO MAKE THE ONLY CHOICE
WE ARE NOT SEPARATE FROM WHAT WE DESTROY
TIME HAS COME FOR US TO MAKE THE ONLY CHOICE
WE RAPE FOR OUR POWER
NOT CARING FOR LIFE
WE TARNISH OUR WATERS
'TIL THEY ARE AS BLACK AS NIGHT
WE VISUALIZE THE FUTURE
WITH THE EYES OF THE BLIND
WE HEAR NATURE CALLING
BUT WE STILL DENY
WE ARE NOT SEPARATE FROM WHAT WE DESTROY
TIME HAS COME FOR US TO MAKE THE ONLY CHOICE
Birth Of A Hero
HE WAS A YOUNG BOY
ABOUT TO BE A MAN
SHE LOVED HIM SO
OH PLEASE DON'T GO
DOWN ON HIS KNEES
THE BLADE PASSED WITH EASE
SHOULDER TO SHOULDER
AS IT PIERCES HER HEART
OUT IN THE FIELDS
THE BOY BECOMES A MAN
TASTE OF BLOOD IN HIS THROAT
FEEL OF DEATH ON HIS HANDS
HE SHALL FALL ON THIS DARK, MISTY NIGHT
AS HE FALLS HE HEARS HIS LOVED ONE CRY
BIRTH OF A HERO
DEATH OF A MAN
SHE'LL NEVER UNDERSTAND
WHY HE LEFT HER HAND
HE WAS A YOUNG BOY
SHE LOVED HIM SO
SHE WATCHED THE SUN SET
AND LONGED FOR HIS JOURNEY HOME
FLAGS FLY LOW
THE BLADE CUT DEEP
NOW SHE MUST BEAR THE WOUNDS
THAT MEMORIES BLEED
Creation
Sin
BLACK IS THE NIGHT THAT CALLS ME
SINNER FROM A SIN
THE WATERS THAT ONCE DID BLESS ME
NOW BURN MY SKIN FEARING THE FIELDS OF FIRE
AND THE WAR THAT'S WITHIN
I'LL DRAW MY SWORD FOR THE LAST TIME
IT'S HERE THIS WILL END
BLACK IS THE NIGHT THAT CALLS ME
A VOICE FROM WITHIN
PLAYING WITH MY EMOTIONS
WHEN WILL IT END?
PROMISING PURE DESIRE
OF THE PLEASURES OF SIN
I'LL DRAW MY SWORD FOR THE LAST TIME
IT'S HERE THIS WILL END
YOU MAY TRY TO FIND ME
I'LL HIDE DEEP IN YOUR HEAD
YOU MAY TRY TO FIGHT ME
I'M A SEED FROM DEEP WITHIN
YOU MAY NOT RECALL INVITING ME
BUT I WAS THERE THE FIRST TIME YOU SINNED
YOU MAY NOT RECALL INVITING ME
BUT I WILL BE HERE UNTIL THE END
(AND HERE IT WILL END)
Song Of Roland
AS CRUSADERS RAVAGE THE EARTH
AT NIGHT THEIR SWORDS AND SHIELDS HANG TO THEIR SIDE
FOR THE BATTLE THEY HAD FORSAKEN
FOR THE GLORY THEY HAD FORTAKEN
THE KING RIDES AHEAD OF THE GROUP
HOMEWARD BOUND HE MARCHES HIS TROOPS
FOR FAIR LAND FRANCE LIES IN THE BALANCE
FOR FOE MAN FRANCE HOME OF THE GALLANT
SONG OF ROLAND
NEVER KNIGHT BE SO WORTHY
SONG OF ROLAND
NEVER KNIGHT BE SO WORTHY
THE KING HOLDS GRIEF IN HIS EYES
FOR HIS NEPHEW HE'S LEFT BEHIND
TO ENSURE THE BACKGROUND IS STABLE
TO ENSURE THEM AGAINST ATTACK
THE KING KNEELS TO HIS NEPHEW,
BRAVE KNIGHT PRINCE ROLAND
HE HOLDS TEARS IN HIS EYES
AND PAIN IN HIS HEART
'FOR OUR GOD'S WE TEAR OUR WORLD'S APART
AND WITH THIS DEATH I LEAVE YOU
ONE LAST THOUGHT
NEVER KNIGHT BE SO WORTHY
TILL FRANCE BE NO MORE'
AS LANCES DRAW UPON THE ENEMY
A SEA OF WAVING BANNERS SURROUND,
THE MOORS FALL FROM THE HILLSIDE
LIKE THE RAIN IN THE DARK FOREST
AS THE BATTLE ROLLS ON
THE MEN FALL TO GROUND
THEIR EARS ACHE FOR THE SHRILL OF THE HORN,
BUT ROLAND PERSISTS ON HOLDING HIS GROUND,
'LET US STRIKE A MIGHTY BLOW
FOR OUR LORD AND OUR GOD!'
SONG OF ROLAND
NEVER KNIGHT BE SO WORTHY
SONG OF ROLAND
NEVER KNIGHT BE SO WORTHY
Crossing Two Rivers
CROSSING TWO RIVERS
AND FIELDS IN THE DARK
HE IS IN LOVE ENSLAVED BY THE HEART
SHE WAITS BY THE WINDOW FOR
THE FIRST SIGHT OF HER LOVE
SHE HOPES AND PRAYS
THAT NOTHING WILL KEEP THEIR LOVE APART
TWO SEPARATE KINGDOMS
TWO SEPARATE LIVES THROWN APART
BY THE HATE AND LIES
SHE WAITS BY THE WINDOW
FOR THE LOVE THAT LEFT HER ARMS
SHE HOPES AND PRAYS
THAT ONE DAY THEIR HEARTS WILL BEAT AS ONE
EVEN THOUGH THEIR WORLD'S AT WAR
LOVE GROWS STRONGER THAN BEFORE
THE MOATS BETWEEN THEIR LOVE GROW SHALLOW
CROSSING TWO RIVERS
AND FIELDS IN THE DARK
HE IS IN LOVE ENSLAVED BY THE HEART
SHE WAITS BY THE WINDOW
FOR THE LOVE THAT LEFT HER ARMS
SHE HOPES AND PRAYS
THAT ONE DAY THEIR HEARTS WILL BEAT AS ONE
EVEN THOUGH THEIR WORLD'S AT WAR
LOVE GROWS STRONGER THAN BEFORE
THE MOATS BETWEEN THEIR LOVE GROW SHALLOW
Troubled Mind
CLOSING MY EYES AGAIN
TO FORGET ABOUT THE DAY
I'VE SEEN IT ALL BEFORE
AND I'LL SEE IT ALL AGAIN
BUT I'LL NEVER KNOW JUST WHY
OH LORD, HELP ME TO SEE A WAY
TO LIVE THIS DREAM
FOR MY TIME IS RUNNING SHORT
AND MY PATIENCE WEARING THIN
BY MORNING I'LL NEVER KNOW
WHAT SHAPE I'LL BE IN
A BROKEN RAINBOW FALLS FROM THE SKY
THE TEARS OF SORROW FILL A YOUNG MAN'S EYES
THERE'S A DARK CRY FROM DEEP INSIDE
FROM A SPLINTERING HEART
THIS RIVER I RIDE ON ALWAYS
SEEMS TO FLOW MY WAY
AND THE STARS I LOOK TO GUIDE ME
SHINE BRIGHTER THAN THE DAY
THE SILENCE OF THE NIGHT
CALMS A TROUBLED MIND
THE WORRIES OF THE DAY
JUST SEEM TO FADE AWAY
(FADE AWAY)
A BROKEN RAINBOW FALLS FROM THE SKY
THE TEARS OF SORROW FILL A YOUNG MAN'S EYES
THERE'S A DARK CRY
FROM DEEP INSIDE FROM A SPLINTERING HEART
Eternity
As I sit upon these rocks above
I feel the waves crash upon the shore
As the sea sprays on my glowing face
I wish I could embrace the sea 
for evermore
As I lay my head to sleep at night
I dream the sea and me we flow as one
But I'm a prisoner of the sands and
no one understands these childish dreams
An old man approaches me
His feeble mind confusing to thee
He speaks in riddles and rhymes
Tales of an old witch that cast him
from the sea
But wait my eyes full of splendor
or could this be some crazy old tale 
I look to his eyes for the answer
I will my soul to the sea
for Eternity
I will my soul to the sea
for Eternity
And so the journey begins
The pain and suffering
Are your dreams worth this torment?
You can deal Another hand
But the light in the distance
promises this the journeys end
Great gods of olympus
Great god Poseidon
Accept this mortal never let 
Him return, For He's willed
His soul to the sea
For Eternity
I will my soul to the sea
for Eternity
I will my soul to the sea
for Eternity
Black Tower
O Black Tower what is your power?
What makes men run and hide
I've foreseen the evil in the
Dead of the night
As the demons they dance in my mind
Telling tales of horror
And the splendor of their torture
Burning flames reach for the sky
The gates of Hell are open wide
O Black Tower
Black Tower
O Black Tower
Why do you devour?
The souls they sleep in the night
Casting evil shadows signs of no tomorrows
Why must I fear for my life?
Telling tales of horror
And the splendor of their torture
Burning flames reach for the sky
The gates of Hell are open wide
Why must the demons dance in my mind?
O Black Tower
Black Tower
Now I know it's the truth
All the evil men do
They shall pay their dues
Nightmares tell the truth
O Black Tower
Black Tower
Why must the demons dance in my mind?
Call Of The Sea
Endless alone lost at sea
It's a never ending chore to
Keep my head above these waters
I've never feared before
The sun has taken its toll
The salt runs in my veins
I've never feared before these
Waters I've grown to hate
Will I live to see tomorrow?
Or will I die in this watery depth?
The sea is calling me
My will to live is stronger than
These tides could ever be
The sea is calling me
Why won't I let these waters
Claim me victory?
I long for the place where the 
Winds and the tide tear at the shore
But in the twilights of my dreams
The fire rages on
Endless alone lost at sea
It's a never ending chore to
Keep my head above these waters
I've never feared before
I long for the place where the 
Winds and the tide tear at the shore
But in the twilights of my dreams
The fire rages on
The sea is calling me
My will to live is stronger than
These tides could ever be
The sea is calling
Why won't I let these waters
Claim me victory?
Proud Nomad
Now I tell you an ancient tale
Of an ancient man
From not such a distant land
Chivalry rode forth on his mighty horse 
The crest of the church 
Engraved upon his chest 
Winding down this dizzy path 
Towards the dragon's lair
The howl of the wind screams beware 
Your pulse starts to quicken
Your blood runs with fear
You feel the heat now rising
It tells the dragon's near
Proud nomad of the past
Beware of yourself for
Your life won't last
Proud Nomad of the past
Pride has killed a thousand 
Men before you 
Proud Nomad of the past
Beware of yourself for
Your life won't last
Proud Nomad of the past
So let not this foolishness 
Hold you in it's grasp
Stop, beware, run for your life
Fear for your life
While there's still time to choose
Halt don't go near
Don't you realize you have only one life 
So don't be a fool
But time and time again
I see it in their eyes
It's the weakness of mortal men
They live by this creed
Though it will find them dead
Proud Nomad of the past
Beware of yourself for
Your life won't last
Red Sands
SHRILL OF THE HORN SCREAMS MY NAME
POUNDING THE GROUND
THE GAMES BEGIN
THE CROWD THEY ROAR
THE BLOOD IT BOILS INSIDE ME
I FEAR NOT YOU YOU FEAR NOT ME
THE SWORDS ARE DRAWN
AND SHIMMERING
THE TIME HAS COME AGAIN 
TO HONOR OUR KING
THE GODS HAVE BLESSED
THIS WICKED GAME
FIGHT WE MUST AND SHOW NO SHAME 
FOR THE TIME HAS COME AGAIN 
TO FEED OUR BLOOD THIRSTY KING
I LOOK INTO YOUR EYES
REFLECTIONS OF THE SKY
A WHISPER ON THE WIND 
AS YOUR SOUL SAYS GOODBYE
REDS SANDS UNDERNEATH MY FEET
STAINED BY THE BLOOD
I DRAW FROM THEE
RED SANDS AS FAR AS I CAN SEE
TAINTED THESE LANDS
STAINED BY HISTORY
WHAT ONCE WAS A WHISPER
NOW IS AN ECHO IN MY HEAD
THE LOOK ON THEIR FACES
AS I STAND IN THIS SEA OF RED
I FEEL THE EVIL RISING
HEAR THE MESMERIZING 
VOICE FROM HELL
FEEL THE EVIL RISING
HEAR THE MESMERIZING
VOICE FROM HELL
One Of The Hunted
I feel the distant stare
Of a watching eye
Watching eyes of THE woodsman
Quivers of death await me here
I'm blind to their illusion - confusion
Fletching of fowl Slips
Through the wind
Releasing their death with
Their fingers
My fate lies on a tensel line
I must escape but there's
Nowhere to hide
The now exchanging roles
In this theater of ill HUMOR
The understudy steals
The stage with an encore performance
One of the hunted - 
The tables have turned
One of the hunted -
There's nowhere to run
One of the hun ted -
The tables have turned
One of the hunted - 
There's nowhere to run
In the temples of nature 
I hear the laughter
Just another victim on 
This lonely trail
They show no emotion for
This loss of life
It reminds me of myself not long ago
And the cries for life that 
I'd seem to ignore
The cries for life are now
My very own
One of the hunted
The tables have turned
One of the hunted
There's nowhere to run
One of the hunted
The tables have turned
One of the hunted
There's nowhere to run
Fire Within
Take a look into the crystal
Take a look at what the
Future may bring
All around you is darkness 
As your shattered soul screams
As I stand before the crystal
See my life pass before me 
Stand up straight look into my
Eyes tell me what do you see?
Is there no gold at the end 
Of this rainbow?
Is there no hope at the end
Of the road?
Will there be strength for 
The dreams that I've lived for 
Or will I just let go?
Many years have passed me by
Many trials of life i've survived
stills the head wind blows my way
It's getting harder everyday
Is there no gold at the end
Of this rainbow?
Is there no hope at the end
Of the road?
Will there be strength for 
The dreams that I've lived for 
Or will I just let go?
The fire within is smoldering
The waters of life are raging In
Once there was passion
Desire to win
Warbird
Taking time out to create 
His own war
It an aerial assault
It's the war of the bird
Strapped to his forearm
Awaiting flight,
He's blind as the night
Set his mask free
Piercing eyes point towards the sea
A waiting white gull 
So swift in flight
Flowing like the sea
Shadowed by his wing spread
As the bird takes to flight
He is bound in ecstacy
As the claws sink in deep
He hears the bird start to scream
As his life is taken from him
Another trophy retrieved
Warbird Champion your King
Warriors on wings
Warbird Champion your King
Warriors on wings
Sheltered eyes hide the deep blue sky
Shackles hold the arching wings
Until tomorrow imprisoned
For tomorrow he will be free
Taking time out to create
His own war
It an aerial assault
It's the war of the bird
Strapped to his forearm
Awaiting flight
He's blind as the night
Set his mask free
Piercing eyes point 
Towards the sea
What About Me
It was just another night
She held me in
Her arms so tight
We were dreaming with the
Stars in our eyes
But I never realized
Like The wild in a cage
Waiting to be free
A bird on the ground
With a broken wing
You wanted to fly
You had to be free
But what about me?
It was just another day
You had so much to say
Our love was still strong
But you had to be free
Like the wild in a cage
Waiting to be free
A bird on the ground
With a broken wing
You wanted to fly
You had to be free
But what about me?
Now the sands of time 
Have buried the heartbreak
You walked in with the wind
Uncovered the memories
You're holding your arms out to me
Temptation is all I see
I have to be strong
You had to be free
Cause it's all about me
Like The wild in a cage
Waiting to be free
A bird on the ground
With a broken wing
You wanted to fly
You had to be free
But what about me?
Etude Jongleur
The Gleeman
My entrance purely pleasure
For your riches I ask you not
For I am the gleeman
Who loves to sing
And strike upon my golden harp
So I bow before you o mighty king
In the hopes you hear my song
These feet have traveled far and wide
In a life lived FOR THE song
I claim no land my home
For I know not where I'm from
Traveled mountain peaks 
And valleys low
In a life for the son of a bard
Raise your harp my friend
For the song that burns
In your heart
Sing of the heroes
And the days that time forgot
Sing of the days of the Earls and 
The Kings and the Knights 
That conquered great feats
For these are the things 
That we all dream
But only your eyes have seen 
A life for a lyric
I've traveled these war lands deep
Raging the knights in shining armor
Surely death awaits the weak
I've sailed the viking vessels
Plunging the northern seas
Crossing the blue horizon
No land for the eye to see
For the eye to see
Raise your harp my friend
For the song that burns 
In your heart
Sing of the heroes
And the days that time forgot
Sing of the days of the Earls 
And the Kings and the Knights
That conquered great feats
For these are the things 
That we all dream
But only your eyes have seen

Silent Goddess
I rest my eyes
on the open field
a silver line
to heavens gate
my mind is blank
it's a state I know
a sacred place
where all I see is hate
I raise my head
to retain my wrath
the savage force
that lives inside of me
foe to foe
one will die and one will be
and I pray she holds my soul
can you hear me calling?
silent goddess won't you
conduct my fear away
silent goddess won't you be
closer when I hate
the battle cries
and the sound of steel
another quest
for holy land
some true belief
in each open wound
in Luna's light the lonely victor stands
and I pray she holds my soul
can you hear me calling?
silent goddess won't you
conduct my fear away
silent goddess won't you be
closer when I hate
silent goddess will you
forever be the same
silent goddess can you
feel this heart pulsate
you know that I die for belief
I swear by the sword in my hand
the sum of the pain and the grief
is nothing compared to the
wealth I obtain
and the spirit of god can expand
Desert Reign
Nights Of Arabia
came across
the waters
a kingdom in the sands
unfaithful to the sultan
a killing was at hand
challenged to survival
a legacy of fear
eternal mystic legends
one for every tear
nights of Arabia
the queen has lost her right to life
nights of Arabia
her destiny in story lines
nights of Arabia
a thousand tales and one for life
these are nights of Arabia
whispers in the moonlight
a gathering of vales
circled round the fire
to hear this evenings tale
standing on the threshold
the crest of darkened nights
seduction of the hunter
the slave regains her might
"lost inside a shadow
erase the sins I've made
heavenly reward me
with mercy on my fate"
nights of Arabia
the queen has lost her right to life
nights of Arabia
her destiny in story lines
nights of Arabia
a thousand tales and one for life
these are nights of Arabia
Scheherazade will never die
the sultan relents his feeble heart
his love for the queen is greater than he'll ever know
"it's easy to let you feed my nights
someone to touch, someone to hold,
someone to feel, someone to love"
"here I am to die alone
voices from heaven above
hear my call awaken my soul
forgive me for what I have done"
challenged to survival
a legacy of fear
eternal mystic legends
one for every tear
The Shadow Of Uther
due to the legend
a new king will come
rise in the morning horizon
brave and believing
for wars to be won
born with the heart of a lion
he will fight for a country unite
till the last drop of blood confines the oath
till all will respect him wherever he roams
deep in the woods
he can hear she's alive
lost in the dark
of a dragons lament
searching the highlands
in trying to find
trace of Morgana
the Princess of Hate
he will be holding
the sword in the stone
knights of the kingdom will join him
bring back the honor
of Pendragons name
from where the cauldron is boiling
but the shadow of Uther restrains
all the efforts to reunite the realm
a witch of his own blood from heaven expelled
deep in the woods
there are prints in the sand
leading towards
where the angels repent
king of the ocean
king of the land
nothing can save him
from Merlin's consent
coming of storms
battles of war
knights of thunder are fearless
thus goes the legend
the tale I was told
now we await his appearance
but the shadow of Uther remains
there is no way the king can break the oath
the shadow will follow wherever he roams
A Sailorman's Hymn
can you hear the sirens resound?
from the coastline of Ireland tonight
it's the song of a promising heart
of the souls that the ocean unite
and she stands by the window alone
staring into the rain
she is trying to guide his way home
from the waters that keep them apart
so she lights up a candle for hope to be found
captive and blind by the darkness around
firm as a mountain, she never will mourn
timeless awaiting the break of dawn
can you hear the sailorman's hymn?
as it comes with the rise of the tide
it is sung where the rainbow begins
as a comfort for tears she has cried
she remains by the window alone
staring into the rain
she is trying to guide his way home
keeps on praying for god to protect him
she lights up a candle for hope to be found
captive and blind by the darkness around
each wave a promise, a new hope reborn
sunrise consoles at the break of dawn
Alexandria
far across the sea
a piece of history
in Egypt's land
I'll build a city
beautiful and strong
beyond belief
a new metropolis
to redefine my destiny
rise and shine Alexandria
under protection of my name
pure, divine, and imperial
a place to watch the stars
the center of the earth
I see it all... my worlds converging
and to guide a king's armada through the night
I raise the seventh wonder to delight Poseidon
rise and shine Alexandria
under protection of my name
pure, divine, and imperial
make me the city of a living angel
casting shades all over Babylon
hailing me, a holy son of god
as a monument of time
and the goals that I achieved
make a sculpture of my mind
The Inquisitor
I am a cleric serving god the king and queen
I claim confession
and true belief by any means
purification heal heretics
burn the demons out
and god's behind me
watch my each and every move
you know I'll find you
in the shadow of a shattered moon
come all you witches
my procedures are approved
won't you let me ease your sorrow
let me guide you through the night
all my methods clean and thorough
don't you fear the light
I reassemble
broken souls and wasted lives
I raise my head and see
my father through the blood red skies
and in my dreams I know he holds my sanctuary
so all you witches bow to the auto-de-fe
just close your eyes and listen to my holy say
you disbelievers
little do you know
won't you let me ease your sorrow
purify your poisoned veins
there is yet a new tomorrow
I will ease your pain
ease your pain
the fire's burning wild
ease your pain
the inquisition
has drained the demons
like I said it would
Glory
sworn by the crown
I lead a crusade
fight for belief to be one
out in the field
fearless and cold
building the road to my Calvary
strong is my steel
dark is my mind
carmine the ground that I tread
faith in my god
keeps me alive
but when does my faith turn to doubt
silently watching the rain
carving the earth on my grave
lord you know that I prayed
one for the glory
and one for the souls that I've slain
how will I know
how could I tell
where would I find some serenity
sowing the seed
unwounded I bleed
lord won't you show me the way
Christ is the cross that I bear
god is the will of my war
faint are the voices I hear
whispers of glory...
Christ is the cry of despair
cursing the day I was born
this is the faith that we share
left with the glory
and suffering of souls that we've torn
Until Kingdom Come
in the black of the night she appears
I can see that she's trying
to relocate the source of my fears
I've been searching her high and low
in this dream she will show me the door
to a new revelation
and I know that I've seen her before
that she'll bring me salvation
I remember when she was still alive
always there by my side
every day is a fight to survive
every minute a shattered memory
like the sun shining down on me
like the breeze on the ocean
you're the path of my destiny
I know you will follow me until Kingdom Come
when I watch from the tower at night
into fading horizons
I can see her shade in the twilight
dressed in silver she's dancing
I recall as if it was today
always there by my side
you are reason, and relief to my pain
and one day we will reunite
like the sun shining down on me
like the breeze on the ocean
you're the path of my destiny
I know you will follow me until Kingdom Come
like the sun shining down on me
like the breeze on the ocean
you're the path of my destiny
I'll follow my heart until Kingdom Come
Lunar Sanctum
little do I know
little do I care
little would it help
if knew and was aware
aim beyond the stars
catch a glimpse of gold
a planetary chart
where the stories are untold
there's a piece of truth for everyone
give me something to die for
like a sacrifice for days bygone
in my solitude
there's a place where I want to hide
with a view to a shallow moon
there's a star in my cosmic mind
that reminds me of you
a gathering of wolfs
under Luna's light
fear of the unknown
make us worshippers at night
there's a compromise for everyone
but I need something to die for
like a sacrifice for days bygone
in my solitude
there's a place where I want to hide
with a view to a shallow moon
there's a star in my cosmic mind
that reminds me of you
tokens of the afterlife
feeding on the blood of Christ
chasing for an alibi
searching for the holyland
following the masterplan
does it matter in end?
souls unwoken
hearts unbroken
lunar rites
seize tonight
Can You Remember
"Hey! Woo! Thank you! Okay, we're gonna slow it down for a bit now.
This is a song about a girl that might have forgotten me by now.
But I hope we will meet again some time in the future."
A flame within my heart has died
This a song, it's song with no reprise
Today I just don't know why
What we had and what we shared, so divine
Sunrise in Osaka, but I'm cold tonight
The northern lights are shining, and my dreams take flight
Can you remember? Tell me how far I have to go
Can you remember lust in the eastern skies?
Can you remember when you told me sayonara?
Can you remember me? 'Cause I will never say goodbye
A flame within my heart has died
Too far away, it's too far for me to say
I wish I could turn back time
Is there anyone to blame? Show me the way
Sunrise in Osaka, but I'm cold tonight
The northern lights are shining, and my dreams take flight
Memories are forever, and I see your face
Crying in the distance, 'til we fall from grace
Can you remember? Tell me how far I have to go?
Can you remember lust in the eastern skies?
Can you remember when you told me sayonara?
Can you remember me? 'Cause I will never say goodbye
Can you remember? Tell me how far I have to go
Can you remember lust in the eastern skies?
Can you remember when you told me sayonara?
Can you remember me? 'Cause I will never say goodbye
"Thank you."
Track comments to "The Fourth Legacy"
"New Allegiance"
Intro music to the CD, we wanted to do something different this time for
our intro. The past had the typical epic intro that a lot of bands seem to
do these days. We liked the feel of this melody and it's a perfect
beginning to a diverse and powerful record.
"The Fourth Legacy"
We wanted to have a song that is an anthem to the past, present and future
of Kamelot. The words all refer to just that. We also wanted to torture
the drummer with a speedy, uptempo song like this one delivers.
Audentis Fortuna iuvat. (Fortune assists the bold)
"Silent Goddess"
This record has a few references to God and war. The irony of wars in the
name of God. The story of this song starts on the battlefield and the
warrior in the heat of battle. He is praying to Mother Mary for
forgiveness. The question, is it right to kill in the name of religion?
"Faith, like a jackal, feeds among the tombs, and even
from these dead doubts she gathers her most vital hope."
"Desert Reign"
Intro song to Arabia. Sascha and I wanted to make this as authentic as
possible. We hired an Arabian musician for percussion and other strange
instruments I've never seen or heard before. The result is a trance like
song that sets the mood perfect for what's to come.
"Nights of Arabia"
This is based on the tales "Arabian Nights" written 100's of years ago.
Out of this tale spawned Sindbad, Ali Baba and many more. Queen Scheherazade
is kept captive and sentenced to die for adultery. The song was my
favorite to record and also the lush strings we added make it very Epic.
"The art of being a slave is to rule one's master".
"The Shadow Of Uther"
We based this song on Uther Pendragon. Father to Arthur of the fabled
Camelot tales. Based in Ireland, the song captures the melodies that
emanate from that region.
"Desire, mans ultimate friend or foe"
"A Sailorman's Hymn"
The album's ballad. This song started out while Khan was visiting me in
America. We were in the middle of writing Alexandria and the electricity
went out in my house. So we lit some candles I started plucking the
acoustic guitar with the main melody of the song. "Bright are the Candles
that shineth tonight" was the original chorus. That inspired the
connection between a Sailorman's loved one back home waiting for his
return from the sea. Backup vocals by Icelander Rannveig Sif
Sigurdardottir add the finishing touches to my favorite Kamelot
ballad to date.
"Hope springs eternal life"
"Alexandria"
Based on Alexander the Great. His conquest and triumphs that led to his
eventual immortality in history.
"The future belongs to those who believe in the beauty of their dreams."
"The Inquisitor"
This is another song that touches on the subject of faith and religion.
In the past and still the present, people were persecuted for their
beliefs. The Inquisitor had the distinction of judging those who were
deemed sinners or witches. We wanted to capture that feel with the
hypnotic chorus.
"Fear of things invisible is the natural seed
of that which everyone in himself calleth religion"
"Glory"
This song was originally meant as a small piece to complement the record.
After a few rehearsals it turned into a very Baroque and moving piece. We
envisioned a String Quartet to complement the arrangements and that just
what we did. The final result for us was beautiful.
"The paths of glory lead but to the grave."
"Until Kingdom Come"
A man's soul mate has died and he is struggling with reality with out her.
Her ghost appears to him in dreams to comfort his fears and one day they
will reunite. Another fast uptempo tune that we will be incorporating more
with the new drummer.
"Death is more universal than life; everyone dies but not everyone lives"
"Lunar Sanctum"
This is more of an experimental song for us. Different than any on the
record, the lyrics are very ambiguous. We want to see what the fans read
into the meaning. Overall the song caps off a CD full of energy and
dedication to staying true to ourselves and our fans.
"There is something haunting in the light of the moon; it has all
the dispassionateness of a disembodied soul, and something of its
inconceivable mystery".
Prologue
"All that you see or seem, is but a dream within a dream"
Center Of The Universe
Move slowly
Beyond the colors of my eyes
Move slowly
Into the corners of my mind
Rising like the Pegasus
Each and every one of us
Released
Islands in the sea of dreams
Always searching harmony
And peace
All we find
Reject our mind
Don't you wonder why
If the war by heavens gate released desire
In the line of fire someone must have known
That a human heart demands to be admired
Cause in the Center of the Universe
We are all alone
Show me sign of paradise
A place we all would like to go to
Tell me what to sacrifice
So there's a chance for me to want you
All I find
Reject my mind
And I wonder why
If the war by heavens gate released desire
In the line of fire someone must have known
That a human heart demands to be admired
Cause in the Center of the Universe
We are all alone
I have a tale to be told won't you listen tonight
Follow me into the core of the fountain of light
Try to imagine that hope is our ship for the soul
(Over the ocean the quest of your life lies ahead)
Maybe together we'll find there's a place for us all
(Follow the star in your mind, sail along sail along)
Farewell
Winter's close...and the mountain high
I'll start my journey now
On this planet we call Earth we belong
I want to know
Why did God make me feel
There is more to be answered
Maybe God cannot remedy
Our souls if he tried
I seek peace of mind at least
And to know I did my best
I will pray for those I have loved
I must take your farewell
Carried by destiny
Bound to obey
I must take your farewell
Trails of discovery
Lead me an ocean away
No one holds the only truth in his hand
So who am I
To defy even God
In quest for a reason
There's no time to waste I'm afraid
I must take your farewell
Carried by destiny
Bound to obey
I must take your farewell
Trails of discovery
Lead me an ocean away
So far away
When the tide is high
I won't dwell or wait no longer
Interlude I (Opiate Soul)
Dulcissimae... oh Fortuna... Venit Meos..
The Edge Of Paradise
Sleepless
Not really quite awake
Where the soul conforms
To deeper needs
Free within frames of custody
I revolve my spirit and exhale
On the edge of paradise
Poison burning
In my veins
Unavailing...compromised
My dreams remain the same
Soothing but yet so violent
In this world within the other world
Moonlight...in visions...heaven sent
I see demon eyes and wings unfurled
On the edge of paradise
Poison burning
In my veins
Unavailing...compromised
My dreams remain the same
On the edge of paradise
Powerless
I sail on by
Undermining life itself
My will to wonder why
Wander
I recall one summer's night
Within the month of June
Flowers in mahogany hair
And smell of earth in bloom
Only such a melody
Comes without a sound
More than faintly heard by those
Who know what they have found
Now it's just a memory
Silently we wander
Into this void of consequence
My shade will always haunt her
But she will be my guiding light
Silently we wander
In search of truth and confidence
So many hopes were lost here
Along the way
From morning to night
Meet me by the wishing well
In cover of the moon
Whisper to me tenderly
That I will see you soon
Sing that song from long ago
So I remember you
Flowers in mahogany hair
And mellow days in June
Only for the memory
Silently we wander
Into this void of consequence
My shade will always haunt her
But she will be my guiding light
Silently we wander
In search of truth and confidence
So many hopes were lost here
Along the way
From morning to night
From ashes we were born
In silence we unite
Interlude II (Omen)
Descent Of The Archangel
Speak my friend
You look surprised
I thought you knew
I'd come disguised
On angel wings...in white
I can make
Your dreams come true
What a couple...
Me and you
On journey through the night
I will show you everything so vividly
You can't deny me
Bathed in moonlight
I'm proclaimed by angels cry
Think well
Do take your time
Because your soul
Will be mine the day you die
Name a pleasure
One...a few
Any form
Of lust in you
Will tremble at my touch
I come down from heaven's light
I have all the perfect alibis
There's so much...
I will show you everything so vividly
You won't deny me
Bathed in moonlight
I'm proclaimed by angels cry
Think well
Do take your time
Because your soul
Will be mine the day you die
Call my name or carry on
Till that last resistance' gone
I'm sure we'll meet again
I'm your true disciple
When the flesh desires
You won't deny me
Interlude III (At The Banquet)
His invitation was clear
I shut my eyes...and now I'm here
Please make way,
our host is making his entree
A Feast For The Vain
Everyone is here
The feast can soon begin
Vanity we celebrate
My favourite of sins
Chandeliers so grand
That heaven sees the shine
And my friend declares
Everything I look at could be mine
It's a miracle
Life till now has been a waste
You have proved to me
By your hand I'm truly graced
Unbelievable
Gold and glitter blinding me
So adorable
All these women from my fantasies
Come with me my little ones
Let's revel for the free
Raise your glass and praise the fact
How easy life can be
In the splendour of the night
I've found company
Once again I feel that life's begun
All the wrongs seem to be right
Drowned in ecstasy
Every star is like a newborn sun
May the life I knew be gone
I accept the deed
But one point we have to modify
If I wish to linger on
In a state of still
Only then I'm yours the day I die
On The Coldest Winter Night
I am breathless,
Need I say
How could you find me here?
You, of all, have crossed my way
Unexpectedly...from where?
I feel like I am dreaming
Hold me close,
Tomorrow may be gone
This is a moment of belief
This is a moment made of dreams
You found me here today
On the coldest winter night
This moment is our right
Now, Helena tell me all
The years we've been apart...
Did you hear the mountain fall?
...my broken heart
Don't wake me if I'm dreaming
Hush, my dear
Because tomorrow may be gone
Lost in the present, I am sure
This is the moment, say no more
You found me here today
On the coldest winter night
This moment is our right
This is a moment of belief
This is a moment made of dreams
You found me here today
On the coldest winter night
This moment is our right
Lost & Damned
Helena you came to me
When seemingly life had begun
Little did I know then
Where this would go
When this begun
Once I was free to fly...
I never promised anything
This may well be goodbye
Don't ask why
Don't be sad
Sometimes we all
Must alter paths we planned
Only try understand
I want to save you
From the lost and damned
Although you hold me close
I feel retention arise
Just as a hint of fear
Like subtle clouds
In summer skies
Once in the moonlight...
I can't explain
And I don't know
Somehow we may reunite
Don't ask why
Don't be sad
Sometimes we all
Must alter paths we planned
Don't forget what we had
But let me save you
From the lost and damned
Love means nothing to me
If there is a higher place to be
Helena don't you cry
Believe me; I do this for you
Heed my decision now
I will be gone tomorrow noon
My tale has just begun
Nothing can take my faith away
In my quest for the sun
Don't ask why
Don't be sad
Sometimes we all
Must alter paths we planned
Only try understand
I try to save you
From the lost and damned
Don't ask why
Don't be sad
Sometimes we all
Must alter paths we planned
Leave me behind, don't look back
Because deep within you know
I'm lost and damned
Helena's Theme
I remember a song
From long ago
Some of the pieces
They remind me of you
How could I know
You were to leave me
I thought that I was that melody
Oh so wrong
I'm but a whisper tonight
And if this is goodbye
I will leave
But I'll love you
Until the end
If the grace of God is real
And the word of Christ can heal
Bring their souls to heaven's light
Bless the unborn child tonight
Interlude IV (Dawn)
Hear ye hear ye! The lady
Helena has committed a sin.
Now death lies on her, like an
untimely frost upon the
sweetest flower of all the field...
The Mourning After (Carry On)
I just had a dream
She was by the riverside
Alone and dressed in white
Paling in the cold
Walking on the icy face
On memories of glory days
Carry on
Carry on
Meet me on the other side
Once the mourning after turns to day
Carry on
Carry on
Keep on to the other side
The mourning after slowly fades
How could I have known
Just the thought is simply wild
In her womb...a little child
I am left to roam
On the surface of a dream
In a world that can't be seen
Carry on
Carry on
Meet me on the other side
Once the mourning after turns to day
Carry on
Carry on
Keep on to the other side
The mourning after slowly fades
Carry on
Carry on
Just you carry on
Till the mourning is over
Carry on
Carry on
Just you carry on
Till the mourning after leaves
Carry on
Carry on
Meet me on the other side
Once the mourning after turns to day
Carry on
Carry on
Keep on to the other side
The mourning after slowly fades
III Ways To Epica
When you play with fire
You must anticipate some burns
Chasing for desire...
It's just a different way to learn
I am defected from God
God had seized my soul
So low redemptions too far
I am heaven's sheen
She's the one that I loved
Love is all we know
And she tore me apart
The dark can never win
All that I require
Is some trust as the pages turn
I can take you higher
Cause your will is my concern
I am defected from God
God had seized my soul
So low redemptions too far
I am heaven's sheen
She's the one that I loved
Love is all we know
And she tore me apart
The dark can never win
So long...maybe forever
I must carry on
Why did God take away
That one thing I wanted
Maybe God is the melody
We all serenade
You would not feel sadness
If you never tasted joy
That's the curse of humans
Born in passion you destroy
Snow
I never count on yesterday
Because the past can also change
I'll never give myself away
Life is worthwhile on the edge
Words sound so hollow in the cold
Maybe she's forgotten all
I don't remember how
I felt the night she came
Memories spin around
They flow
Don't want to let her down
Moments disappear like shame...like snow
Signs never told me anything
Nothing I could know for sure
I never knew what she would bring
Or what I am to her today
My words...
Almost swallowed by the snow
Maybe she's forgotten all
I don't remember how
I felt the night she came
Memories spin around
They flow
Don't want to let her down
Moments disappear like shame...like snow
She is the poison in my mind
The thorns in my head
She has no mountain to be climbed
No faults to regret
I never count on yesterday
Because the past may not exist
I'll never give myself away
When there's reason to resist
Words draped in crystals melt away
I don't remember how
I felt the night she came
Memories spin around
They flow
Don't want to let her down
Moments disappear like shame...like snow
Like The Shadows
Like the shadows cover me
Rising from my ecstasy...
In a glimpse from a quiet childhood
I recall a mother's smile
Nothing needs to be understood,
I am free
In the deep of a distant forest
I'll lose my sense of time
Where the words of the wind is honest,
I can breathe
Someone told me there's a higher mountain
But I'll wait here for a while
Only led by the deepest hunger,
I'll flee from exile
Like the shadows cover me
You're behind me once again
Rising from my ecstasy
Rising from my pain
Like the shadows follow me
You can wash my steps away
Not the one I want to be
But still somehow the same
Regalis Apertura
Forever
there's a pain within
that I can't define
there's an empty space
where your love used to shine
from the night we met
till the day you died
do you think I wished
do you still believe I tried
all too soon we were divided
and life had just begun
will you revive
from the chaos in my mind
where we still are bound together
will you be there
waiting by the gates of dawn
when I close my eyes forever
I belong to you
you belong to me
it's the way things are
always meant to be
like the morning star
and the rising sun
you convey my life
and forgive me what I've done
all too soon we were divided
into darkness and light
will you revive
from the chaos in my mind
where we still are bound together
will you be there
waiting by the gates of dawn
when I close my eyes forever
save me
reverse how I'm thinking of you
every breath I take
brings me closer
closer to forever, to you
I'm waiting for the day that I'm gone
Wings Of Despair
sometimes my visions
are distant and vague
down at the base
of the mountain
once in a while I am
weak and afraid
tired and sick of it all
I don't believe
that my story is set
nothing is destined
or blatant
bound to this body
a world full of hate
no one will heed if I fall
no one can see it
but you know that it's there
guiding the steps of your soul
holding the truth
in the cross that you bear
die with a heart that is bold
fly on the wings of despair
no one is holding you back
the call of the wild is internal
conquer the silence you fear
tomorrow will not fade to black
a new day is dawning
remember
no one can save you today
the questions are more
than the answers I know
that doesn't mean you are lonely
searching for more
consecutive goal's
making it worth to go on
no one can see it
but you know that it's there
guiding the steps of your soul
holding the truth
in the cross that you bear
die with a heart that is bold
fly on the wings of despair
no one is holding you back
the call of the wild is internal
conquer the silence you fear
tomorrow will not fade to black
a new day is dawning
remember
no one can save you today
you, and you alone
is forging the path
leave your sorrows with the past
never believe
that the story is set
nothing is destined
or blatant
bound to this body
a world full of hate
no one will heed if you fall
The Spell
where has all the magic gone
lost behind or lost along
a victim of the pulse of our society
don't you miss the ancient times
the riddles and the subtle signs
a relative perspective on reality
I get stronger in the splendor
of a lucid moon
only creatures of the night
all my demons cast a spell
the souls of dusk rising from the ashes
so the book of shadows tell
the weak will always obey the master
heading for the dragons lair
another time and a different sphere
I leave the nothingness behind
and when the sense of logic yields
I'll escape the outer shields
into the universal mind
I get stronger in the splendor
of a lucid moon
only creatures of the night
can heal my wounds
Don't You Cry
little by little
I've come to this point
on my own I've been searching my way
I lost you so early
the days went so fast
you don't know how I prayed every day
a song to remember
a song to forget
you'll never know how I tried
to make you proud
and to honor your name but
you never told me goodbye
now that your are gone
casting shadows from the past
you and all the memories will last
don't you cry
or suffer over me
I will be waiting for you
don't you cry
angels never fade away
I'll be watching over you
see you through
now I'm a man and
I'm feeling you still
could it be you were there all along
a time to surrender
a time to forgive
with solace I give you this song
now that you are gone
casting shadows from the past
in my dreams I hear your voice at last
don't you cry
or suffer over me
I will be waiting for you
don't you cry
angels never fade away
I'll be watching over you
see you through
I can see you tonight
in the pale winter light
father and son again
the bond of blood will never end
Karma
I am a king of honor
gold and glory
but every king must also die
have I been just and righteous
what is glory
I know I've torn and taken life
and here I stand
a small and simple man
who will trade his karma for my kingdom
a sacrificial rite to render truth
the fire in my soul rejects my wisdom
cause all you do in life comes back to you
I am a king in crisis
counting minutes
there is an ending to my reign
my sins have come to face me
I can feel it
that I have lived my life in vain
and now I know I'll reap
the seeds I've sown
who will trade his karma for my kingdom
a sacrificial rite to render truth
the fire in my soul rejects my wisdom
cause all you do in life comes back to you
am I mad
I feel so void and cold
who can tell
who holds the stories untold
tired and trembling
I am descending
will I have to stay here
and live this life again
The Light I Shine On You
yet a day is dawning
I am sad but also strong
this gift that I've been given
tells me where I do belong
falling I'm falling down
and you recall my strength
time will slowly pull me under
but you will catch my breath
this is a praise to all of you
cause the light I shine on you
is what you gave to me
I'm a crystal clear and true
I'm your cairn and creed
you think that I'm a mountain
but there's a price I have to pay
for the love I have forsaken
can never be replaced
crying I'm crying out
be careful with my soul
unbounded I'm like water
but so fragile in the cold
and this is a praise to all of you
cause the light I shine on you
is what you gave to me
I'm a crystal clear and true
I'm your cairn and creed
the mysteries of life
take us high and low
the road can be long
it seems
someone is lost
but no one is free
falling I'm falling down
into your open arms
each and every gathered glow
maintains my shining star
this is a praise to all of you...
Temples Of Gold
I see you when it snows
in crystals dancing down
from a sultry sky
when silence is pure and unbreakable
I can see you smiling
in every frozen tear
I can hear you whisper "You and I?
little did we know
that they were life itself
the days passing by
we both had our share in the sacrifice
once upon a time
we had something beautiful
once upon a time
I thought "you and I?
take me wherever
the answer lingers in the sand
show me the way as the story unfolds
love is remote
in this wailing winter wonderland
show me the way to the temples of gold
bless me with a kiss
across the universe
when day and night converge
and whisper my name till I fall asleep
tell me tales from days bygone
tell me little lies
tell me once again it's just "you and I?
Across The Highlands
I've been witness to so many wars
that I'm blind to affliction
no ability left to remorse
it's my faith and conviction
wide awake
in this world
full of hate
I unfurl
but I am damned
if life itself is condemnation
I am immortal
thus my freedom is captivity
flying all across the highlands
searching for a way
to finalize my history
rising high above the mountains
reaching for the sky
closer to my sanctuary
all my life I've been trying to die
reach complete segregation
I am ready to open my eyes
to a new revelation
lost in time
there's no place
for my soul
in his embrace
for I am damned
if life itself is condemnation
I am immortal
thus my freedom is captivity
bound to live eternally
However; the line thus my freedom is captivity is incorrect.
the correct line for the second and third time they sing this
bridge is:
I am immortal
and I can't escape my destiny.
Bound to live eternally
Elizabeth: I. Mirror Mirror
mirror can you tell me
how to stay forever young
let me know the secret
I will hold my twisted tongue
please protect my beauty
velvet skin so pure and white
hear my name resounding
like a hymn at dead of night
once I struck a servant
she's a virgin free from sin
drops of blood caressed me
and refined my aging skin
could this be the answer
uncorrupted carmine red
voices keep resounding
in my dazed bewildered head
have I found myself eternity
someone has heard my prayers
now I'll become divine
have I found myself divinity
I'm no longer a slave
to the vicious hands of time
Elizabeth: II. Requiem For The Innocent
mother can you hold me
one more time again
whisper "I still love you? in my ear
mother did you lie
would you tell me why
there is something deeper that I fear
justify the malice I portray
daggers in the darkness find your way
when the moon is full and piercing bright
drench me with your innocence tonight
don't you want to die
walk beside me evermore
don't you feel alive
like you've never felt before
visions of the future
unprofound and blurred
I have passed the point of no return
justify the malice I portray
let me keep my beauty one more day
when the moon is full and piercing bright
drench me with your innocence tonight
don't you want to die
walk beside me evermore
don't you feel alive
like you've never felt before
don't you want to die
souls transcending, silver shine
don't you feel alive
your blood preserves my place in time
Elizabeth: III. Fall From Grace
breathe in deep
smell these halls of hate
carve your name into these walls
before it is too late
cold and twisted
they resisted
what was I to do
all I ever wanted was
a fraction of the truth
walking in the shadows
of my blackened mind
lost inside this shallow
vanity of time
what if there's a God a hell and heaven
fire is the torment I must face
dying by the souls I have forsaken
no one's going to catch my fall from grace
(bleed on me)
watch me from your cage
as I rejoin my painful prime
(suffer and exhale)
you and I are relics
we provoke and we recline
walking in the shadows
of my blackened mind
angels crave my sorrow
sorrow they will find
what if there's a God a hell and heaven
fire is the torment I must face
dying by the souls I have forsaken
no one's going to catch my fall from grace
walking in the shadows
of my blackened mind
angels crave my sorrow
sorrow they will find
Ne Pleure Pas
si lentement
arrivé à ce point
sans personne
j'ai tracé mon chemin
toi sorti de ma vie
le temps passe si vite
tu n'sais pas mes prières chaque jour
chanson aux mémoires
chanson à l'oubli
sans adieu tu partais
tous mes efforts
pour te rendre si fier
jamais tu ne les voyais
toi parti d'ici
oh, les ombres du passé
ton souvenir me consolait
ne pleure pas
ni souffre pour moi
un jour on se trouvera
ne pleure pas
les anges nous protégeront
je te garde dans mon coeur
à jamais
homme maintenant
je te sens près de moi
étais-tu avec moi malgré tout
le temps de se rendre
le temps du pardon
consolé je te donne ma chanson
toi parti d'ici
oh, les ombres du passé
dans mes rêves enfin il y a ta voix
ne pleure pas
ni souffre pour moi
un jour on se trouvera
ne pleure pas
les anges nous protégeront
je te garde dans mon coeur
je te revois ce soir
dans la pâleur d'hiver
père et fils ensemble
les liens du sang
tiendront toujours
Once And Future King
long time ago
the seed was sown
a child born in Uther's name
concieved in sin
the future King
a new realm of truth proclaimed
they came from far
to meet this man
they saw he was just and wise
the flags unfold
the fires rise
reflecting the hate in his eyes
fighting for the crown
pride and honor to be found
born from sin
into Merlin's hand
once and future king
vowed to return again
in moonlit haze
among the hills
Sir Mordred, Morgana's shade
would slay his king
forever cling
to darkness his powers fade
fighting for the crown
pride and honor to be found
born from sin
into Merlin's hand
once and future king
vowed to return again
Bedivere, my best of knights
this sword I beg you take
to the place where it belongs
and throw it in the lake
into the war
forever more
the nation follow the chosen one
as when alive
his will survives
to rest on the island of Avalon
The Black Halo
Come wind come snow come winter land
I have resigned myself to death
Come will to show the heathen hand
So I can draw my final breath
You could take me higher
So you said I trusted you
I may be a liar
But betrayal lies on you
I could feel where the journey ends
Final cough of a last defense
Darkness come tonight
I have no fear of what you hold
Darkness come alive
You are the stories I've been told
I possess a power
Of survival in the cold
Life is like a flower
As it stumbles out of fold
We all know when the time has come
This is where I will linger on
Darkness come tonight
I have no fear of what you hold
Darkness come alive
You are the stories I've been told
Darkness come tonight
Nothing can take my faith away
Darkness come alive
Life turns to black from silver gray
Darkness come tonight
I have no fear of what you hold
Darkness come alive
You are the stories I've been told
Darkness come tonight
Nothing can take my faith away
Darkness come alive
Life turns to black from silver gray
Soul Society
If my soul could revive
From my carnal remains
What does it matter to me
If it all fades to black
If I'm born once again
Then no one really is free
How could I be condemned
For the things I have done
If my intentions were good
I guess I'll never know
Some things under the sun
Can never be understood
How can we believe in heaven
Human reason counters all
My tears are soul society
My life is just a fragment
Of the universe and more
There must be more than I can see
In the dark we're the same
In the concept of time
We're like a grain in the sand
And we sprout from the flame
As if death was a rain
'Cause we can not understand
How I wish there was a heaven
All for one and one for all
A flawless soul society
Our lives are just a fragment
Of the universe and more
There may be more than we can see
How I could I be condemned
For the things that I've done
If my intentions were good
I guess I'll never know
Some things under the sun
Can never be understood
How can we believe in heaven
All for one and one for all
My tears are soul society
Our lives are just a fragment
Of the universe and more
And maybe more than we can see
The Edge Of Paradise
Sleepless...
Not really quite awake
Where the soul conforms
To deeper needs
Free within frames of custody
I revolve my spirit and exhale
On the edge of paradise
Poison burning
In my veins
Unavailing...compromised
My dreams remain the same
Soothing but yet so violent
In this world within the other world
Moonlight...in visions...heaven sent
I see demon eyes and wings unfurled
On the edge of paradise
Poison burning
In my veins
Unavailing...compromised
My dreams remain the same
On the edge of paradise
Powerless
I sail on by
Undermining life itself
My will to wonder why
Center Of The Universe
Move slowly
Beyond the colors of my eyes
Move slowly
Into the corners of my mind
Rising like the Pegazus
Each and every one of us
Released
Islands in the sea of dreams
Always searching harmony
And peace
All we find
Reject our mind
Don't you wonder why
If the war by heavens gate released desire
In the line of fire someone must have known
That a human heart demands to be admired
But in the Center of the Universe
We are all alone
Show me the sign of paradise
A place we all would like to go to
Tell me what to sacrifice
So there's a chance for me to want you
All we find
Reject our mind
Don't you wonder why
If the war by heavens gate released desire
In the line of fire someone must have known
That a human heart demands to be admired
But in the Center of the Universe
We are all alone
I have a tale to be told won't you listen tonight
Follow me into the core of the fountain of light
Try to imagine that hope is our ship for the soul
(Over the ocean the quest of your life lies ahead)
Maybe together we'll find there's a place for us all
(Follow the star in your mind, sail along sail along)
Nights Of Arabia
Came across
The waters
A kingdom in the sands
Unfaithful to the sultan
A killing was at hand
Challenged to survival
A legacy of fear
Eternal mystic legends
One for every tear
Nights of Arabia
The queen has lost her right to life
Nights of Arabia
Her destiny in story lines
Nights of Arabia
A thousand tales and one for life
These are nights of Arabia
Whispers in the moonlight
A gathering of vales
Circled round the fire
To hear this evenings tale
Standing on the threshold
The crest of darkened nights
Seduction of the hunter
The slave regains her might
"Lost inside a shadow
Erase the sins I've made
Heavenly reward me
With mercy on my fate"
Nights of Arabia
The queen has lost her right to life
Nights of Arabia
Her destiny in story lines
Nights of Arabia
A thousand tales and one for life
These are nights of Arabia
Scheherazade will never die
The sultan relents his feeble heart
His love for the queen is greater than he'll ever know
"It's easy to let you feed my nights
Someone to touch, someone to hold,
Someone to feel, someone to love"
"Here I am to die alone
Voices from heaven above
Hear my call awaken my soul
Forgive me for what I have done"
Challenged to survival
A legacy of fear
Eternal mystic legends
One for every tear
Abandoned
Once my life was plain and clear
I recall once my ignorance was bliss
Nightfall came like a serpent's kiss
To my troubled mind
Why, oh why, my god
Have you abandoned me
In my sobriety
Behind the old facade
I'm your bewildered child
So take me across the river wide
Binding promises were made on my soul
Grand illusions led astray
Ice cold winds swept my heart away
Bring me back to you
Why, oh why, my god above
Have you abandoned me
In my sobriety
Behind the old facade
I'm your bewildered child
So take me across the river wide
Forever
There's a pain within
That I can't define
There's an empty space
Where your love used to shine
From the night we met
Till the day you died
Do you think I wished
Do you still believe I tried
All too soon we were divided
And life had just begun
Will you revive
From the chaos in my mind
Where we still are bound together
Will you be there
Waiting by the gates of dawn
When I close my eyes forever
I belong to you
You belong to me
It's the way things are
Always meant to be
Like the morning star
And the rising sun
You convey my life
And forgive me what I've done
All too soon we were divided
In darkness and light
Will you revive
From the chaos in my mind
Where we still are bound together
Will you be there
Waiting by the gates of dawn
When I close my eyes forever
Save me
Reverse how I'm thinking of you
Every breath I take
Brings me closer
Closer to forever, to you
I'm waiting for the day that I'm gone
Keyboard Solo
The Haunting (Somewhere In Time)
Maybe the sound of your voice
Made me believe that that you were her
Just like the river disturbs
My inner peace
Once I believed I could find
Just a trace of her beloved soul
Once I believed she was all
Then she smothered my beliefs
One cold winter's night
I may follow her voice to the river
Leave me for now and forever
Leave what you can
Somewhere in time I will find you and haunt you again
Like the wind sweeps the earth
Somewhere in time when no virtues are left to defend
You've fallen deep
I was a liar in every debate
I drew the forces that fueled your hate
When the cold in my heart leaves it comes to an end
Quietly now go to sleep
How could that first time recur
When memories linger on and on
What made me think you were her
Helena is dead to all dead to all
Nothing can bring her to life
Don't pretend that I've been loving you
Once I believed she was gone
I corrupted from within
Leave leave me for now and forever
Leave what you can
Somewhere in time I will find you and haunt you again
Like the wind sweeps the earth
Somewhere in time when no virtues are left to defend
You've fallen deep
I was a liar in every debate
I drew the forces that fueled your hate
When the cold in my heart leaves it comes to an end
Quietly now go to sleep
Follow me into the light
Dance on a lake of tears
I'll take you through
Or leave me tonight
I've gone too far to begin all anew
With someone like you
Somewhere in time I will find you and love you again
Like the wind sweeps the earth
Somewhere in time when no virtues are left to defend
You've fallen deep
I was a liar in every debate
I drew the forces that fueled your hate
When the cold in my heart leaves it comes to an end
Quietly I'll go to sleep
Moonlight
I have never craved the system's sympathy
I get restless over pity smiles
Some precaution wouldn't harm my history
If I had the will to wait a little while
You cut the silence like a knife
You know I can't repent for
Moonlight falling over me
Sail on where the shadows hide
Moonlight crawling down on me
Just like you could not compete with my pride
Compensation for a misconducted life
Is it way too much to ask
Hard to wake up with your heart and soul deprived
When the morning comes to second to your last
You cut the silence like a knife
Like the edge of my last defenses
You cut the silence like a knife
You know I won't repent for
Moonlight falling over me
Sail on where the shadows hide
Moonlight crawling down on me
Just like you could not compete with my pride
Shine on silver
From the sky into the night
Guide on shivers
And I need your bleeding light
Moonlight falling over me
Sail on where the shadows hide
Moonlight crawling down on me
Just like you could not compete with my pride
Moonlight falling over me
Sail on where the shadows hide
Moonlight crawling down on me
Just like you could not compete with the pride
When The Lights Are Down
Rules without exceptions last eternally
Every move you make creates your destiny
I've come to soak my sorrow
In hate as black
As black as the seed of my soul
'Cause when the lights are down
There's no more to say
Love is the real pain
An eternal revolution in my heart
And when the lights are down
You're so far away
Tell me your real name
In the silence of the darkness we unite
Rules without exceptions last eternally
Every move you make creates your destiny
What can protect me from the past
And all the things that I have done
She told me
And then she went out
But when the lights are down
There's no more to say
Deep in the shadows
Where the last of my delusions
Make their stand
'Cause when the lights are down
She'll take me away
Tell me her real name
In death we'll live the love
We never had
Wellcome all you faithful
Meet the moon
Meet the moon
Into the body as one
Marching on
'Cause when the lights are down
There's no more to say
Love is the real pain
An eternal revolution in my heart
'Cause when the lights are down
She'll take me away
Tell me her real name
In death we'll live the love
We never had
Elizabeth (Part I, II & III)
Mirror can you tell me
How to stay forever young
Let me know the secret
I will hold my twisted tongue
Please protect my beauty
Velvet skin so pure and white
Hear my name resounding
Like a hymn at dead of night
Once I struck a servant
She's a virgin free from sin
Drops of blood caressed me
And refined my aging skin
Could this be the answer
Uncorrupted carmine red
Voices keep resounding
In my dazed bewildered head
Have I found myself eternity
Someone has heard my prayers
Now I'll become divine
Have I found myself divinity
I'm no longer a slave
To the vicious hands of time
Mother can you hold me
One more time again
Whisper "I still love you" in my ear
Mother did you lie
Would you tell me why
There is something deeper that I fear
Justify the evil I portray
Daggers in the darkness find your way
When the moon is full and piercing bright
Drench me with your innocence tonight
Don't you want to die
Walk beside me evermore
Don't you feel alive
Like you've never felt before
Visions of the future
Unprofound and blurred
I have passed the point of no return
Justify the evil I portray
Let me keep my beauty one more day
When the moon is full and piercing bright
Drench me with your innocence tonight
Don't you want to die
Walk beside me evermore
Don't you feel alive
Like you've never felt before
Don't you want to die
Souls transcending, silver shine
Don't you feel alive
Your blood preserves my place in time
Breathe in deep
Smell these halls of hate
Carve your name into these walls
Before it is too late
Cold and twisted
They resisted
What was I to do
All I ever wanted was
A fraction of the truth
Walking in the shadows
Of my blackened mind
Lost inside this shallow
Vanity of time
What if there's a God a hell and heaven
Fire is the torment I must face
Dying by the souls I have forsaken
No one's going to catch my fall from grace
Watch me from your cage
As I rejoin my painful prime
You and I are relics
We provoke and we recline
Walking in the shadows
Of my blackened mind
Angels crave my sorrow
Sorrow they will find
What if there's a God a hell and heaven
Fire is the torment I must face
Dying by the souls I have forsaken
No one's going to catch my fall from grace
Walking in the shadows
Of my blackened mind
Angels crave my sorrow
Sorrow they will find
March Of Mephisto
You know just who I am
Don't be so distant
Cause when you're lost
I am solely there to share your grief
Wailing in you're sorrow
Is only my way to comfort you
Reminders of innocent youth
Waiting for morrow you're lonely
I name your solitude
I speak the truth
Now tell me all about you're pain
Down to the detail
Don't say it's love
Your frail heart feeds my contempt
Wailing in you're sorrow
Is only my way to comfort you
Reminders of innocent youth
Waiting for morrow you're lonely
I name your solitude
I speak the truth
Chase the heathen call
We belong... You and I
Unison in all you deny
I am the thorn in your side
That seeks accomplishment
Reminding the mortal of death
I am the spore of your pride
An angel heavensent
The master of all
I am the urge of the flesh...
Karma
I am a king of honor
Gold and glory
But every king must also die
Have I been just and righteous
What is glory
I know I've torn and taken life
And here I stand
A small and simple man
Who will trade his karma for my kingdom
A sacrificial rite to render truth
The fire in my soul rejects my wisdom
Cause all you do in life comes back to you
I am a king in crisis
Counting minutes
There is an ending to my reign
My sins have come to face me
I can feel it
That I have lived my life in vain
And now I know I'll reap
The seeds I've sown
Who will trade his karma for my kingdom
A sacrificial rite to render truth
The fire in my soul rejects my wisdom
Cause all you do in life comes back to you
Am I mad
I feel so void and cold
Who can tell
Who holds the stories untold
Tired and trembling
I am descending
Will I have to stay here
And live this life again
Drum Solo
Farewell
Winter's close...and the mountain high
I'll start my journey now
On this planet we call Earth we belong
I want to know
Why did god make me feel
There is more to be answered
Maybe god cannot remedy
Our souls is he tried
I seek piece of mind at least
And to know I did my best
I will pray for those I have loved
I must take your farewell
Carried by destiny
Bound to obey
I must take your farewell
Trails of discovery
Lead me an ocean away
No one holds the only truth in his hand
So who am I
To defy even god
In quest for a reason
There's no time to waste I'm afraid
I must take your farewell
Carried by destiny
Bound to obey
I must take your farewell
Trails of discovery
Lead me an ocean away
So far away
When the tide is high
I won't dwell or wait no longer
Outro
Epilogue
One other year has left my life
One year bygone so soon
These were the days I sacrificed
These days were lived for you
Some came with winter in white
Some days were blown away
Some came with sultry summer nights
Some with October rain
Oh, how I long for utter silence
But who am I to know
When rain will turn to snow?
If life brings another day
Solitaire
Rule The World
When a new day reaches dawn
I feel it's worth the wait
But I tumble and I fall
When up against my fate
When the barricades come down
I build them up again
When I'm just about to drown
I still don't know the end
Sometimes I tremble
Like a little child
That faces morning
With a broken smile
Sometimes I crumble
When the shades unfurl
Sometimes I feel that
I could rule the world
When the morning comes alive
Release your love brigade
At the end of day it's night
To suck it up with hate
(That faces morning
With a broken smile
Sometimes I crumble
When the shades unfurl
Sometimes I feel that
I could rule the world)
Ghost Opera
Walls so white
Where your sorrows have a name
And day is dark as night
There's no remorse and no redemption
Close the door
Can you hear the crowd is waiting?
For a last encore
Screaming out for my attention
Chanting my name
Welcome all to curtain call
At the opera
Raging voices in my mind
Rise above the orchestra
Like a crescendo of gratitude
This is my song
Like the dead
I am on the other side
They're howling in my head
There's no remorse and no redemption
Hush my dear
Let the music fill the night
And soon it's all we hear
Screaming out for my attention
Chanting my name
Chanting my name
Welcome all to curtain call
At the opera
Raging voices in my mind
Rise above the orchestra
Like a crescendo of gratitude
Don't wake me
Until it's over
I, I may be dreaming
And awake
Chanting my name
Chanting my name
Welcome all to curtain call
At the opera
Raging voices in my mind
Rise above the orchestra
Welcome all to curtain call
At the opera
Raging voices in my mind
Rise above the orchestra
The Human Stain
See the cemetery sky
Carmine red and deep
Watch the oceans rising high
It's the human stain
Talk about the growing hunger
Ask why with deep concerned
Don't you think the human races
Is ceaselessly vain
But it hurts to be
Alive my friend
In this silent tide
We're driftwood passing by
Don't you wish you
Were a child again
Just for a minute
Just for a minute more
Hear the ticking of a clock
The sound of life itself
No one really wants to die
To save the world
Tell me that you're torn asunder
From how we fail to learn
And tell me if the Earth goes under
Where's your anger now
So it hurts to
Be alive, my friend
In this masquerade where
All one day must die
Don't you wish you
Were unborn again
Just for a minute
Just for a minute more
Tic-Toc
The ticking at the tear asunder
The beating from a heart of stone
The loss of your divine prosperity
'Cause it costs to
Be alive, my friend
And this life that someone
Merely gave to you
That's the price you take
Minute by minute
You beg for a minute more
Blücher
Dim is the light of a war day
In the land of the undying sun
Hollow the silence around me
Distant the sound of a gun
Port side is close to the shore
I wonder where she is
Incoming shot cross the bow
Will she remember me
Wail my April moon
God forsaken soul
I remember you
Come with me tonight
Damned is the dawn of a new day
Revelations of death and despair
Frost misty waters around me
Frantic and naked the fear
Port side is close to the shore
Incoming shot cross the bow
Wail my April moon
God forsaken soul
I remember you
Come with me tonight
Say your prayers
Loud and clearly
All who still believe in god
Love You To Death
When they met she was fifteen
Like a black rose blooming wild
And she already knew she was gonna die
"What's tomorrow without you?
Is this our last goodbye"
She got weaker every day
As the autumn leaves flew by
Until one day, she told him,
"This is when I die"
"What was summer like for you?"
She asked him with a smile
"What's tomorrow without you?"
He silently replied
She said,
"I will always be with you
I'm the anchor of your sorrow
There's no end to what I'll do
'Cause I love you, I love you to death"
But the sorrow went too deep
The mountain fell too steep
And the wounds would never heal
'Cause the pain of the loss
was more than he could feel
He said,
"I will always be with you
By the anchor of my sorrow
All I know, or ever knew,
Is I love you, I love you to death"
"What's tomorrow without you?
Is this our last goodbye?"
"I will always be with you
I'm the anchor of your sorrow
There's no end to what I'll do
'Cause I love you"
Up Through The Ashes
So you can heal
They claim with conviction
You've got a crowd
So what's your appeal
Your voice, your predictions
They're getting loud
But if I let you die, you must forgive me
Raise me up, up through the ashes
(welcome the paradise you made)
Take me on, into the light
You want to die
Create a sensation
Be makin' the news
An eye for an eye
my king of creation
king of the Jews
Before I let you die, you must forgive me
Raise me up, up through the ashes
(welcome the paradise you made)
Take me on, into the light
Give me a sign of remorse
(I don't need your blood)
You will hang on the cross
For playing god
You the people must decide
The self-proclaimed prophet, or the novice murderer
The king or the convict, it's up to you
So tell me who's free to go
Raise me up, up through the ashes
(forgive my every sin)
Take me on, into the light
Raise me up, up through the ashes
Take me on, into the light
Mourning Star
On the fields you restore your beliefs,
Like an old man in church on a Sunday.
crawl the dirt on your elbows and knees,
Any minute you know you could die.
So come save us, turn water to wine,
Give me words of unfathomable wisdom
As I'm crossing the enemy's line,
Where the wounded and dead show the way.
(Show me the way)
Tell me when the night is gone,
Like washed away,
Make a wish beneath the mourning star.
How can there be a reason for war?
For the life of a human that suffers
I remember, I heard it before,
Tell me all when the new day begins.
(The new day begins)
Tell me when the night is gone,
Like washed away,
Make a wish beneath the mourning star.
When the victory is won,
The old cliché,
Underneath the same old mourning star.
why please tell me why
You gave the world all this pain
Tell me when the man is gone,
Like washed away,
Make a wish beneath the mourning star.
When the victory is won,
The old cliché,
Underneath the same old mourning star.
Silence Of The Darkness
I don't dare to take it slowly,
Cause time may pass me by.
Restless like a newborn morning,
I am hard to satisfy.
Will you take me away?
In the silence of the darkness,
I can't pretend I'm wide awake,
Afraid I could go under.
In the silence of the darkness,
I stumble for the light of day,
But the journey never ends.
I can paint the world with flowers,
grown by heaven's gate.
and reckless like the stormy ocean,
I could cover them with hate.
But it all sounds the same.
In the silence of the darkness,
I can't pretend I'm wide awake,
Afraid I could go under.
In the silence of the darkness,
I stumble for the light of day,
But the journey never ends.
In the silence of the darkness,
I can't pretend I'm wide awake,
Afraid I could go under.
In the silence of the darkness,
I stumble for the light of day,
But the journey never ends.
Anthem
What's the miracle, if life itself is not?
Who am I to praise it's worth
With a hymn??
I may stumble over words that I forgot,
Just as life itself will slowly begin.
Sing me a song for the mountains to move,
Sing me the anthem of life,
Sing me the anthem of life.
I'm sceptical, I like my glass of wine,
I don't know your name, or what I am to do.
One day you'll wonder why I read between the lines,
And you will sing for me, the way I sang for you.
Sing me a song for the ocean to part,
Sing me the anthem of life,
Sing me the anthem of life,
Sing me the anthem of life.
So another page is turned,
Pray I understand what's happening,
But if anything, I do know this,
I'll be the best I can.
Sing me a song like the angels rejoice,
Sing me an anthem of life,
Sing me the anthem,
Sing me the anthem of life.
EdenEcho
First you said that you would never leave me
Merry were my days
Then you told me life is never easy
And left without a trace
But how come I want you
Like the soil yearns for the rain
Won't you light up
Won't you light up my life
Let my soul breathe
Tell me wrong tell me right
You're my mind cage
Like a mountain far away
You were always there
Dressed in summer white
You will never know how much I miss you
Or open to my fear
Find a maze I make my way through
and enter if you dare
How come I want you
Like the soil yearns for the rain
Won't you light up
Won't you light up my life
Let my soul breathe
Tell me wrong tell me right
You're my mind cage
Like a mountain far away
You were always there
Dressed in summer white
Remember my name
And paint the darkness with your light
Go sing your song for all the broken hearted
Like Eden echoes in my head
The unforgiven gave you all
Won't you light up
Won't you light up my life
Let my soul breathe
Tell me wrong tell me right
You're my mind cage
Like a mountain far away
You were always there
Dressed in summer white
The Pendulous Fall
In a garden in a hand
Lies a key to shadow land
You're far from feeling strong
The worst begins
In the sediments of life
In the comfort of a knife
You hold your breath
And pray to god it won't take long
And you wonder where the rainbow ends
With its autumn setting sun
There's a way from it all
Though the chances are small
We'll come back again
Won't you think it over
Life is a pendulous fall
But maybe worth the pain
And soon enough we'll go
Where nobody can touch us
Like a mother you were aimed
And you gave her what she claimed
Just like a good old friend
In the abyss of the mind
You found all there is to find
Bet we all have broken hearts to mend
So you wonder where the rainbow ends
Where the world must have begun
There's a way from it all
Though the chances are small
We'll come back again
Won't you think it over
Life is a pendulous fall
But maybe worth the pain
And soon enough we'll go
Where nobody can touch us
There's a way from it all
Though the chances are small
We'll come back again
Won't you think it over
Life is a pendulous fall
But maybe worth the pain
And soon enough we'll go
Life is a pendulous fall
But maybe worth the pain
(So you wonder where the rainbow ends)
Where nobody can touch us
Season's End
Once in my life
A second of eternity
Seems long in my mind
What used to be
Keep changing over time
Don't go
Please don't say it's over 'til it is
Don't say goodbye
Like we'd never meet again
Leave me a lie
At the season's end
Moments in time
Seems to be so long
In my old mind
My images of may
You gave me a sign
I took the chance
Of never looking back
I hope you understand
Don't say goodbye
Like we'd never meet again
Leave me a lie
At the season's end
Come lift the light
Into heaven with a song
Don't say goodbye
'Cause it's been so long
It's been so long
It's been so long
You gave me a sign
I took a chance
By never looking back
I hope you understand
I hope you don't say goodbye
Like we'd never meet again (Say goodbye...)
Leave me a lie
At the season's end (Season's end)
Come lift the light
Into heaven with a song (With a song...)
Don't say goodbye
'Cause it's been so long
It's been so long
So long
The fortune is smiling at our first effort,
let me lead you and you will be safe,
the voice of people, voice of god
for bigger glory of the god
to the infinity.
You know just who I am
Don't be so distant
Cause when you're lost
I am solely there to share your grief
Wailing for your sorrow
Is only my way to comfort you
Reminders of innocent youth
Waiting for morrow you're lonely
I name your solitude
I speaketh the truth
Now tell me all about your pain
Down to the detail
Don't say it's love
Your fragile heart feeds my contempt
Wailing for your sorrow
Is only my way to comfort you
Reminders of innocent youth
Waiting for morrow you're lonely
I name your solitude
I speaketh the truth
Chase the heathen call
We belong... you and I
Unison in all you deny
Wailing for your sorrow
Is only my way to comfort you
Reminders of innocent youth
Waiting for morrow you're lonely
I name your solitude
I speaketh the truth
I am the thorn in your side
That seeks accomplishment
Reminding the mortal of death
I am the spore of your pride
An angel heaven sent
The master of all
I am the urge of the flesh
When The Lights Are Down
Rules without exceptions last eternally
Every move you make creates your destiny
I've come to soak my sorrow in halo black
As black as the seal on my soul
Cause when the lights are down
There's no more to say
Love is the real pain
An internal revolution in our minds
And when the lights are down
You're so far away
Tell me your real name
In the silence of the darkness we unite
(Rules without exceptions last eternally
Every move you make creates your destiny)
What can protect me from the past
And all the things that I have done
She told me and then she was gone
But when the lights are down
There's no more to say
Deep in the shadows
Where the last of my delusions made a stand
Cause when the lights are down
She'll take me away
Tell me her real name
And in death we'll live the love we never had
Come all ye faithful beneath the moon
Into the void as one
Marching on
The Haunting (Somewhere In Time)
Merely the sound of your voice
Made me believe that
that you were her
Just like the river disturbs
...my inner peace
Once I believed I could find
Just a trace of her beloved soul
Once I believed she was all
Then she smothered my beliefs
One cold winter's night
I may follow her voice to the river
Leave me for now and forever
Leave while you can
Somewhere in time
I will find you and haunt you again
Like the wind sweeps the earth
Somewhere in time
When no virtues are left to defend
You fall in deep
I was a liar in every debate
I rule the forces that fueled your hate
When the cold in my heart leaves
It comes to an end
And quietly I'll go to sleep
How could that first time recur
When memories linger on and on
What made me think you were her
Helena is dead to all
dead to all
Nothing can bring her to life
Don't pretend that I'll be loving you
Once I believed she was gone
I'm corrupted from within
Leave me for now and forever
Leave while you can
Follow me into the light
Leave me tonight
I've gone too far to begin all anew
With someone like you
Like ice on a lake of tears
I'll take you through
Life fades in anew
With someone like you
Soul Society
If my soul could revive
From my carnal remains
What does it matter to me
If it all fades to black
If I'm born once again
Then no one really is free
How could I be condemned
For the things that I've done
If my intentions were good
I guess I'll never know
Some things under the sun
Can never be understood
How can we believe in heaven
Human reason counters all
Ideas of a soul society
My life is just a fragment
Of the universe and all
There must be more than I can see
In the dark we're the same
In the concept of time
We're like a grain in the sand
And we strive for the flame
As if death was our aim
Cause we cannot understand
How I wish there was heaven
All for one and one for all
A flawless soul society
Our lives are just a fragment
Of the universe and all
There may be more than we can see
Interlude I: Dei Gratia
Sub sole nihil novi est
Ad aspera per aspera
Quærite prime regnum Dei
Ante bellum, memento mori
Nothing new under the sun
to the stars through the thorns
At first seek the kingdom of the god
Remember the death before war.
Abandoned
Once my life was plain and clear
I recall
Once my ignorance was bliss
Nightfall came
Like a serpent's kiss
To my troubled mind
Why my God
Have you abandoned me
In my sobriety
Behind the old facade
I'm your bewildered child
So take me cross the river wide
Binding promises were made
On my soul
Grand illusions lead astray
Ice cold winds swept my heart away
Bring me back to you
I remember a song
Like in a dream
Where September was long
And winter unreal
Why my God above
Have you abandoned me
In my sobriety
Behind the old facade
I'm your bewildered child
So take me cross the river wide
This Pain
Pushing for the limit of sanity
Pushing for the surface
...so I can breathe
Dark is the night for us all, but some days
I feel the light crawling down from these jagged walls
Blessed sunlight
Some of this pain is sole subjected
But what was I to do
Some of this pain will always stay
Deep and true
I left her with a warning... without protection
'Cause the human nature has its ways with lust
With her back against the wall she crumbled
Just a minute more would have saved her life
And even so... part of me
Blessed sunlight
Some of this pain is sole subjected
But what was I to do
Some of this pain will always stay
Deep and true
I see her shame in my desire
It all took place too soon
Some of these wounds will always bleed
Over you
Moonlight
I have never craved the system's sympathy
I get restless over pity smiles
Some precaution wouldn't harm my history
If I had the will to wait a little while
You cut the silence like a knife
You know I can't repent for all
Moonlight falling over me
Sail on where the shadows hide
Moonlight crawling down on me
Just like you could not compete with my pride
Compensation for a misconducted life
Is it way too much to ask
Hard to wake up
With your heart and soul deprived
When the morning comes
The second to your last
You cut the silence like a knife
At the edge of my last defenses
You cut the silence like a knife
You know I won't repent for all
Moonlight falling over me
Sail on where the shadows hide
Moonlight crawling down on me
Just like you could not compete with my pride
Shine on silver from the sky into the night
Gaia shivers and I need your leading light
Moonlight falling over me
Sail on where the shadows hide
Moonlight crawling down on me
Just like you could not compete with my pride
Interlude II: Un Assassinio Molto Silenzioso
C'era una volta un uomo
Con gli occhi verso la luna
E si chiedeva:
"Verra presto l'amore?"
E che altro esiste
In un cuore gelato?
Tranne il pensiero
Di un assassinio molto silenzioso
[Once upon a time there was a man
With his eyes towards the moon
And he wonder to himself:
"Will love come soon?"
And does something else exist
In a frozen heart?
Except the thought of a
Very silent murder]
The Black Halo
Come wind
Come snow
Come winterland
I have resigned myself to death
Come will to show the hidden hand
So I can draw my final breath
You could take me higher
So you said and I trusted you
I may be a liar, but betrayal lies on you
I can feel when the journey ends
Final call for a last defense
Darkness come tonight
I have no fear of what you hold
Darkness come alive
You are the stories I've been told
I possess the power
Of survival in the cold
Life is like a flower
As it stumbles out of fall
We all know when our time has come
This is where I will linger on
Darkness come tonight
I have no fear of what you hold
Darkness come alive
You are the stories I've been told
Darkness come tonight
Nothing can take my faith away
Darkness come alive
Life fades to black from silver grey
Nothing Ever Dies
Here we are
Under the same old sun
All alone yet somehow bound and unified
Dust to dust...
Ashes to ashes won't take long
We search for a harbour
Somewhere to belong
They say that faith is all you need
To stay forever young
What you've sown is what you reap
Our sins can't be undone
There is a god in each society
So right is wrong where wrong is right
No one could be sure
Still we are certain
That what we know is truth
The only truth
We're building our temples taller
They say that faith is all you need
To stay forever young
What you've sown is what you reap
Our sins can't be undone
How can we trust them once again
They used to tell us lies
Their voices will sustain
Cause nothing ever dies
Love is the only truth
Pure as the well of youth
Until it breaks your heart
You took me higher
Than the mountains I have climbed
You waited all your life for me
You left me all alone behind
But we'll meet again
We will meet again
Memento Mori
Who wants to separate
The world we know from our beliefs
And who sees only black and white
Distinguish loss from sacrifice
Some day we may come to peace
With the world within ourselves
And I will await you
Until I close my eyes
When your time has come
You know you'll be lonely once again
And the final winter comes to us all
Life is treacherous
But you're not the only who must pretend
We're a second in time
We're the last in the line
Of the prey that walks the earth
Good and evil combined
I am the god in my own history
The master of the game
I may believe if she would come to me
And whisper out my name
Sometimes I wonder where the wind has gone
If life has ever been
Sometimes I wonder how belief alone
Can cut me free from sin
When you close your eyes
Mementos of summer retrieves your mind
Like a drizzle afternoon cleans the air
When the winter blows
You're glad you remember you really tried
And it comes to an end
Even winter... life fall
And we all have our beliefs
Pray for mercy for all
I am a man without a mystery
The deal is done within
I will embrace the coldest winter breeze
And pay for every sin
VICTORIA, NON PRAEDA
MEMENTO MORI
UNA VOCE... VOLO, NON VALEO
DULCE ET DECORUM EST
PRO PATRIA MORI
MEMENTO MORI
So subservant in your embrace
No more denial
No run away
This is the final
My last recall
And that's the price for what we learn
The more we know the more we yearn
Cause we're so alone
I am a man without a mystery
The deal is done within
I will embrace the coldest winter breeze
The journey can begin
I'm still the god in my own history
I still believe that she will come to me
And whisper out my name
Some day we will come to peace
And reach beyond behind the lies
And I will await you
Until I close my eyes
Interlude III: Midnight - Twelve Tolls For A New Day
Life has never been better than it is right now (Happy new year)
And finally while I still have your attention
I want to wish you all a happy new year (Yahoo!)
Happy new year
Serenade
Songs of pain and soothing lullabies
Songs of happiness and some that make us cry
One song we share
The cross we all bear
One that segregates
One that unifies
All we wonder
No one ever denies
If once given life we must die
So bow down with me
Where summer fades into fall
And leave your hatchets of hate
Bow down with me
And sing the saddest of all
The song we all serenade
The more we know
The less we understand
Life... eternity
The savagery of man
We want it all
Aimed at the fall
What is destiny with the masterplan
All we wonder
No one ever denies
If once given life we must die
So bow down with me
Where summer fades into fall
And leave your hatchets of hate
Bow down with me
And sing the saddest of all
The song we all serenade
Hold on now
Don't leave don't let it go
Dance away the waltz of life
Right or wrong
The seed we never sow
That's our loss
Our sacrifice
What does the winter bring
If not yet another spring
Epilogue
One other year has left my life
One year bygone so soon
These were the days I sacrificed
These days were lived for you
Some came with winter in white
Some days were blown away
Some came with sultry summer nights
Some with October rain
Oh, how I long for utter silence
But who am I to know
When rain will turn to snow?
If life brings another day
Providence
Here - I stand before you all
This body's been beaten and battered
But I will not fall
Time - It may change me
As I look back upon this cold life
I see nothing but misery
Push me: Pull me:
I will not turn away
All this: Pain will:
Prove fruitful one day
You'll see
As I stand I see legions before me
They drink and they dance
In the night
Without thinking I unsheathe my sword
My body is ready to fight
I Walk into the fire
They say that I've sunk so low
But my goal lies much higher
I will, Not lie
Down in the grave
If they, Want me
I am not afraid
Tempting Providence once again
I fall to my knees and my hands
Tempting providence
When will this madness end
You made me the man that I am...
Now
That I am old and wise
The fire has dimmed to a wisp
But I'm still alive
Oh-
The end is much closer
I never thought I'd see the day
When it would be over
Hold me, Tell me today is the day
All this, Pain will soon go away
Tempting Providence once again
I fall to my knees and my hands
When will this nightmare end
Tempting providence once again
This nightmare will soon reach its' end
Millennium
I look into the black horizon
The more I see the more I know
I try to justify the wars won
But that won't satisfy my soul
I hold the future in my hand
But I could easily destroy
I see the footprints in the sand
They seem to vanish in the void
Can I walk away
Can I choose to stay
Feel I'm getting near
Voices that I hear
Sail away, follow the sacred heart
Chase the sun, one with the moon and stars
Sail away, You'll find the promised land
In your hand, there is a New Millennium
I wish wouldn't have to worry
About the life that lies ahead
But when the present turns tomorrow
I shall remember what they said
Feel I'm getting near
Voices that I hear
Sail away, follow the sacred heart
Chase the sun, one with the moon and stars
Sail away, you'll find the promised land
In your hand, there is a New Millennium
King's Eyes
Seize this regal day
Your time has come
Reach for the crown
Take all that you can
Its your time to become the King
Its time to take
All that life has to give to you
Look towards the heavens search you soul
It will tell you the truth that I'm told
Brave men will fight
Weak men will always die
Never to reach the the top of the mountainside
Look through these King's Eyes
What do you see?
Fortune and glory and triumphs to be
Look through these King's Eyes
What do they tell?
Your desire will never be killed
There's a certain feeling you get
At the moment you know you're the one
That sets the course of your own destiny
Controlled by you alone feel it rise
Inside your heart
The winning force at hand reach for the crown
Take all that you can
You can do anything
You can be king
Don't be controlled
Master your own destiny
Brave men will fight
Weak men will always die
Never to reach the the top of the mountainside
Look through these King's Eyes
What do you see?
Fortune and glory and triumphs to be
Look through these King's Eyes
What do they tell?
Your desire will never be killed
Look through these eyes...
Expedition
Freedom fires burning
Mighty kingdoms shall rise
Crystal ships have returned
Like pawns on a distant shore
There's a cold empty place inside
Where you know there's no end
Mighty storm mighty storm
Stirs from the skies above
Like a cold chill rushed upon my face
Searching - for what awaits us
Set a course for a new shore
For what tomorrow will bring
Plunging the northern seas
Winds fill the sails
As we approach another world
That time has forgotten me
The sun blinds and circles me
No man is an island
No footsteps have walked these shores
Discoveries on virgin soil
Let the Expedition begin
Searching - for what awaits us
Set a course for a new shore
For what tomorrow will bring
Where I Reign
Spinning twisting in my hand
I hold the key to this wasteland
I've been searching it for you
Don't try to run
Don't hide away
There is no hope you can't escape
I see your smile fade away
Your bright blue sky has turned to gray
Tonight
Unlock the door
Close your eyes
I'll set you free
Here, in this spiralling darkness
Where my pleasure is your pain
Fear wraps it's arms around you
Here: is where I reign
It feels so good
This feels so right
That you should be my sacrifice
Don't try to run
Don't hide away
There is no hope you can't be saved
Here, in this spiralling darkness
Where my pleasure is your pain
Fear wraps it's arms around you
Rhydin
In a time in a place
Long ago today
I can see it there in the distance
In the air on line
On the corner of the mind
Rhydin is rising against the sun
Rhydin is rising
Join us a new world is open
Rhydin is rising
Don't you know its a new kingdom
Its new kingdom
In the sea its a birth
On the corner of this earth
Somewhere in the dark horizon
These are the days
Endless wars
In the fields and on our shores
Where the minute last a day
Rhydin is rising
Join us a new world is open
Rhydin is rising
Don't you know its a new kingdom
Its all there, its all there in your mind
Parting Visions
Remembering that day
I see my body below me
Sighs rend the air
Night will it find the day
Or will I slumber for Eternity
There's a knocking at the gates
The darkness is calling me
How will I know what awaits?
Pulled through these hollowed halls
The light in the distance
As my spirit falls
I must not leave this world
But I lost my resistance
Heaven held before me
I can see The fires are churning
Is this really how it has to be?
Parting Visions in my head
Calling out your name
It screams to be heard
Voices in my head
Parting Visions in my head
Calling out your name
It screams to be heard
Voices in my head
Once A Dream
I saw your shadow disappear
Outside my door today
Now I'm left here lost and alone
I light a candle in your name
An eternal burning flame
Shining like the sun to find your way home
Cold tide tower my way
And now I know
Warm skies shower my face
Find your way home
I knew this day would come
But I feared it anyway
Now my castles cold and dark
What was once a dream now becomes our destiny
And I can't wait another day
What was once a dream now means everything
To me.To me.
No country can divide
No seas can separate
Our souls tonight
We are one
What was once a dream now becomes our destiny
And I can't wait another day
What was once a dream now means everything
To me. To me
Irea
I had to climb the highest mountain
I was on my own
And I had to walk through fire and rain
In my search for you
I will search for you
I had to sail the seven seas
Into no mans land
And I found my place in history
Found out who I am
Who am I?
Irea
I close my eyes and call your name
Irea
I pretend you're mine again
I fall into you once again
Chasing memories
And I will live in Cardinal Sin
When you set me free
Wont you set me free?
Irea
I close my eyes and call your name
Irea
I pretend you're mine again
Irea
I need you here
Irea
Once you are gone I go insane
Siége
One Day
Can you remember the morning I told you goodbye,
Just when a new was dawning a piece of me died...
somehow I have to try to
getting used to being alone
If I could only hold you once again
I'd never let go
save me a prayer
when day turns to night
lord won't you
show me the light
one day - I'll find back to my heart and soul again
one day - I swear swear by your name
memories keep me awake
and you're there by my side
I wonder if its only in my mind
that I am alive
save me a prayer
when day turns to night
lord won't you
tell me I'm right
one day - I'll find back to my heart and soul again
one day - I swear swear by your name
The Great Pandemonium
War, war, war, war, war, war, war...
On a silent shore
I spoke to God
The sun is down
Assemble the great pandemonium
War
One more down by the brook of Babylon
One more down in accordance with my fate
One long drift across the lake of Avalon
One more trip that I must create
And my eyes sweep a shore
that was always there
A blood red line
Through the sonisphere
I can't resolve where it's coming from
I sense it's the great pandemonium
One more, just one more
Just one, just one more day
One more day by the pits of hell
Just one more when even yesterday was too late
One more thought that I had to sell
One last trick that you can't debate
War
On a silent shore
I confronted fear
I spoke to God
But he wasn't there
The sun is down
And the war begun
Assemble the great pandemonium
Red light
Put the breaks down
Red light
Put the breaks down
And my eyes sweep a shore
That was always there
A blood red line
Through the sonisphere
I can't resolve where it's coming from
I sense it's the great pandemonium
On a silent shore
I confronted fear
I spoke to God
But he wasn't there
The sun is down
And the war begun
Assemble the great pandemonium
Just one, just one, just one more day
Just one, just one, just one more day
Just one, just one more
War
If Tomorrow Came
I'm not sure
If she could ease your pain
You've been gone for awhile
Crushed you heart and soul
And teased your bane
Hush your mouth
Here she comes
Watch out
She can see you
Like the hounds of Hell
Smell your fear when you flee
Here she comes
Velvet ocean paradise
The power sorceress
At your fingertips
God made flesh
Perfect Alibi
You saw her walking
Over poison ivy leaves
Nobody knows her name
But something must have
Opened your eyes it seems
Cause nothing is quite the same
I'm not sure about a thing
You know
Days are long in the haze
Here she comes
Velvet ocean paradise
the power sorceress
Get a glimpse of God
Here she comes
With her good advice
You wanted every single moment
You've resigned
Knowing there's none to blame
You might as well
I swear on my life you tried
As if tomorrow came
Searching in the deepest forest
Merging with belief you saw her
All you've seen and all you've known
Tells you that she kept you warm
Dear Editor
"Dear Editor,
This is the Zodiac speaking.
I am back with you.
Tell Herb Caen I am here.
I have always been here.
That city pig, Toschi, is good, but I am both smarter and better.
He will get tired then leave me alone.
I am waiting for a good movie about me.
Who will play me?
I am now in control of all things.
Yours truly..."
The Zodiac
She was so kind to me
She sang her little shadow song
And I could not resist it
Bitter blood, come sing along
With your hand upon the bible
Would you swear that is the truth?
(The whole truth and the truth alone)
If she had only shut her mouth
Shattered memories of quiet cold rejection
A careful devil's irony in pure perfection
In pure deceit
You ask me
Was it all I had to tell?
Was it all I could recall?
Know that I broke her neck
A twisted china white visage
I may seem unaffected
But don't we all want to be god?
Is it all you can remember?
Would you swear it on your life?
You will never really know my name without reflection
A careful devil's irony in pure perfection
In pure deceit
But in the moment it's so beautiful
Flow along with a hunger
With the nature of the beast
These are shattered memories of quiet cold rejection
A careful devil's irony in pure perfection
You will never really know my name without reflection
A careful devil's irony in pure perfection
In pure deceit
Hunter's Season
Someone to protect and be protected by
When that certain fury would come
Someone to respect and be respected by
When deprivation took its toll on you
No more to defend, fading away
'Cause we were always alone,
We were born in the hunter's season
All I really ever wanted was for you
You to die in the arms of someone
Someone to remember only to the ground
When the sudden glory is gone
Mother would you send a sign, a message down
Consolidation with your only son
No more to defend, but someone to love
'Cause we were always alone,
We were born in the hunter's season
All I really ever wanted was for you
You to die in the arms of someone
This destiny falls upon you
'Cause nothing remains, so long
Only a miracle could have killed the pain
You see, now you go
In silent custody, you meet my eyes
Though life is long I know you'll wait for me
Know it too
'Cause we were always alone,
We were born in the hunter's season
All I really ever wanted was for you
You to die in the arms of someone
House On A Hill
Call me a liar, a king or a fool
But sing me a song of prosperity
Higher and higher the further we fall
Hard to remember
I will surrender and I'll always wait
Wait as in all of eternity
Hard to remember, and hard to forget
The shadow that hangs over me
Take me home, to a house on a hill, in oblivion
And take away the shadow over me
Cry me a river but once you run dry
Say there's a reason you do
Godless endeavors, smothered and broken
All that I wanted was you.
Take me home, to a house on a hill, in oblivion
Where souls never die all alone
You're longing for love, not for sympathy
So take away the shadow over me
Under the starlight you shine in solitude
Eyes on the ocean and far beyond west of the moon
Take me home, to a house on a hill, in oblivion
Where souls never die all alone
You're longing for love, not for sympathy
Over the hills
Home, to your house on a hill, to oblivion
Where souls never die all alone
You're longing for love, not for sympathy
So take away the shadow over me!
Necropolis
Sunshine
Swell life
Soak in another day
All that I need
Is a reason to go
You and I
Could fly away
We'd go up
And never come back down
From Heaven you know
Wake me
Revolve
In my wounds
Lay down your enemy
On the altar of refined deception
Hate me
I'm all over you
Reset the harmony
Like a fire in the night
Pushing closer
East side silence
One last warning
West side
Let all be friends
Every nation
Thank you
For putting down your arms
This was the war
To end all wars
This was the war to save democracy
Wake me
Like nails in my spine
Let's play the tragedy
In the fire of
A last temptation
Hate me for wasting my time
On commonalities
In the name of self-respect
Don't wait too long
Don't harvest too late
May I wish you won't
Believe in your fate
Wake me
Revolve
In my wounds
Lay down your enemy
In the fire of a last temptation 
Hate me for wasting my time
On commonalities
In this city of the dead
My Train Of Thoughts
In the shadow of my doubt
This life is dust on naked walls
In the ruins of defeat
The spotlights fade
There's a clown without a crowd
His sorrow smiles relentlessly
Welcome winter bittersweet
Of final fall
My train of thoughts
Keep on hauling me over a low again
Easy to see for a someone
Whose soul can bleed
Who am I to overrule
Believers at the wonder wall
Some illusions come undone
And violently
My train of thoughts
Keep on hauling me over a low again
Easy to see for a someone
Whose soul can bleed
So far astray
When all comes to all
You'll never be satisfied
You might as well let go
Seal Of Woven Years
Pull the trigger now
If you're craving a hero
Or say life after death
Was it you or was it me
Who had to fake
Implementation
Of a lonely heart
So warm and oh so weak
My fractured eyes
In the mold below
The fattest lies
Hold your needs
Wait for the morning
Come a different day
Carry the weight of all
You say is wrong
We would both deny
There is a secret fate
A seal of woven years
Of waiting flying by
Rush my head
Into your wall of complaints
And crush me softly
Like you crushed yourself asunder
You better leave me be
Now go
My soul was sold
For a rainy day
But it's not too late
For a full retreat
 
Wait for the morning
Come a different day
Carry the weight of all
You say is wrong
We would both deny
There is a secret fate
A seal of woven years
Of waiting flying by
 
Poetry For The Poisoned - Incubus
There was a time when I was young
A boy with bold ambitions
There was a time when I could tell the crooked from the wicked one
There was a song that someone sung
A hint of recognition
There was a time I knew you well enough to know you won't be gone
 Come with me tonight
Tell me how it feels to be alive
There was a time I had respect
A name of reputation
There was a time when I could watch myself without being disgraced
 Come with me tonight
Let us find a place where we can hide
 Come into the light
Let me show you how we stay alive
The word "incubus" means "to lie on", and it was believed that any feeling in bed, such as a weight pressing down on your chest, especially accompanied by nightmares, was a sure sign that an incubus had attempted to have a nocturnal intercourse with you.
Given the religious fervour of the Middle Ages, it is not altogether surprising that the idea of a demon lover was believed to account of this phenomenon.
Poetry For The Poisoned Pt. 2 - So Long
A minute more
'Til the light of day is seen
Lay down
I know you must be nearly there
A bloody kiss
And the vision of a dream
For the last of your days in the sun
In the white light I am calm
Yet peculiarly cold
Silent slumber
And wide awake
Lord have mercy on my soul
So long
Your sorrow be gone
(Show me how it feels to be alive)
No more denial
So long
(Let us find a place where we can hide)
You fed me long
And by God you fed me well
Sleep tight
This day belongs to you my dear
And I am bound
Like a beast onto its prey
We are one of a kind you and I
Pale moon wander
I'm wide awake
Lord have mercy on my soul
So long
Your sorrow be gone
(Show me how it feels to be alive)
No more denial
So long
(Show me all the splendors of the night)
So long
The little last of your attention
Sorrow
This flood to wash your mind
See me
The God of your imagination
Feel me
Come with me tonight
So long
Your sorrow be gone
Show me how it feels to be alive
No more denial
So long
Poetry For The Poisoned Pt. 3 - All Is Over
I am the hole in your broken heart
I am the reason we all depart
What if all is over
Poetry For The Poisoned Pt. 4 - Dissection
Life in slow review
I see it with my eye
Deeper down and further back
The storm reveals a hidden track
The sun is coming through
Down by a lake
As a child
Without a fear
When a mother's warm embrace
Made a haven in the maze
Those were the moments
And these were my days
Once Upon A Time
I am scorn in this heavenly scheme
With a stench of destruction
I'm a reaper of beautiful dreams
And she knows
I'm on the edge
Sacrilege
Push me over
Tell me once upon a time
I close my eyes
And see myself reborn
Righting the wrong
I won't stay to stand in line
Or wait for God to shine all over me
I wait for the storm
I am you
And know that you heard
You and I are the last
At the end of the world
Then we talk
And we run
And we hide
Then so what
The human race
Suffocates
Leave me breathless
Tell me once upon a time
I close my eyes
And see myself reborn
Righting the wrong
I won't stay to stand in line
Or wait for God to shine all over me
I wait for the storm
Move along
Through the ashes of a dream
Move along
And see myself anew again
Manus Dei
Give me a sign
Sing the words of innocence and broken pride
Make my conclusions fail
Send me a sign
Heal this broken melody
'Cause each day
A dying Hell
Sacrimony (Angel Of Afterlife)
A passing life each day, a carving on the wall
It's like a night without awakening
The truth is lost and maybe never to be found
Like the shadows of my pantomime
When all the world is gathered for the final feast
Will there be someone to believe in me?
Voices echoing in my distorted mind
Is this for real or just a dream?
(Am I losing my mind? I am not afraid, my dear)
Sing for me angel of afterlife calming me down
Chaos inside my nebula
And make the wrong turn to right in a celestial light
Forgive my sacrimony
Tell me what they say that I'm supposed to know
Tell me every little detail
Make truth appear for me as distant memories
Like pictures on a silver screen
It all becomes clear
The truth will appear
Forever I'm there for you and sing.
And now leave me alone
Erase my memory
Don't want to hear, don't want to see
Don't want to think about the lie that follows me
All becomes clear
But no one will hear my testimony 
I am your angel of afterlife calming you down
Silence inside your nebula
And when the wrong turns to right in a celestial light
I'll heed your testimony
(Ring around a rosie,
A pocketful of posies,
Ashes, ashes
We all fall down)
Ashes To Ashes
Ravished from our paradise
A crack in the mirror
I know who's to blame
So full of life but paralyzed
Etched on my iris
But I try not to think of it all...
We swore to god in veritas
And burned our skin like it burned our souls
One dealt with grief by causing pain
She hid behind maple and built her own fortress of sound
Hear this melody almost forgotten
Hush
I've been waiting a lifetime to show you
You're returning to heaven
Like dust to dust
I've been waiting forever to witness your fading
Like ashes to ashes.
Forbidden dance on fragile skin
Why do you shine as I suffer in pain?
The greatest scars remain within
Leaving you now with a heart black as cardinal sin.
Fear this melody almost forgotten
Hush
I've been waiting a lifetime to show you
You're returning to heaven
Like dust to dust
I've been waiting forever to witness your fading
Like ashes to ashes!
Hate... My solution...
Fate... An illusion.
Torn
Like a pendant on the neck of a queen
Ten thousand scars, an embrace of the stone
As we dance on a steady canopy
Accuse me, fool me, take all my pain away
My friend singing my final song of honor
Betrayed but still I never came around to open my mind
I was torn by the storms in my head
Like a victim of fate
Born to regret
Still denied by the spirits of hell
A call to repent
'Til the visions still stand in silence like a shadow
Like a martyr that is nowhere to be seen
Ten thousand stars I've prayed for (have prayed for the calm)
As we drift on this neverending sea
Clear me, keep me, take all my pain away, my friend
Singing my final song of glory
Betrayed but still I finally came around and opened my eyes
I was torn by the storms in my head
Like a victim of fate
Born to regret
Still denied by the spirits of hell
A call to repent
'Til the visions still stand in silence like a shadow
Like a shadow
Torn by the thorns in my head
Like a victim of violence
A call to repent
Denied by the spirits of heaven
Take me up again to the music of dawn
I was torn by the storms in my head
Like a victim of fate
Born to regret
Still denied by the spirits of hell
A call to repent
'Til the visions still stand like a shadow
Song For Jolee
There's a shadow in the cold white light of day
I hope that someday you'll forgive and set me free
While standing in the pale white light, Jolee is lost
I wrote a letter to the angels to follow me into the light again.
Underneath the velvet letters of my heart
Always will remind me that I'm hurt and sad
I'm sorry but I can't stop the bleeding
Crying and it's all because of you.
One look in the mirror to see
What's real and fake, Jolee.
There's a princess captured in a wooden frame.
I'd trade eternity for one last look at you.
Not playing by the rules
We played the game of loss.
I'll keep on writing to the angels so you're safe 'til the moment we meet again.
Underneath the make-up the scars that sear my heart,
Unspeakable reminder that I'm hurt and sad
I'm sorry but I can't stop the bleeding
Crying and it's all because of you.
One look in the mirror to see,
What's real and fake, Jolee.
I'm sorry but I can't stop the bleeding
Crying and it's all because of you.
One look in the mirror to see,  what's real and fake,
 
Jolee.
Oh.
One look in the mirror to see, what's real and fake, Jolee.
Veritas
In the mirror my reflection lies to me
That is not the man I want to see
But every harvest takes me closer to my aim
I will be there as soon as darkness falls
My life is but a heartbeat away
And all you've ever had will soon belong to me
(In morte ultima veritas)
You will kneel before me
And you will confess that I'm god
(Vincit veritas in omni re)
Send me your prayers
But death is the answer to life
While you're weeping, feed my anger I stay calm
'Cause I'm sure that you won't let me down
Fading gently to the sound I can't forget
And don't you know that when the music dies
My life is but a heartbeat away
And all you've ever had will soon belong to me
(So short but innocent
It always will remain
And all I know is
It was good
My childhood memories
And I was blessed to live)
(Please, please let it die
Or brother this is my last goodbye
I'm begging you)
My Confession
Give me a sign
Sing the words of innocence
And broken pride
Make my conclusions fail
Send me a sign
Hear this broken melody
'Cause each night i die
In hell
My god has shown his sympathy
For all the spirits lost
I'll pray for salvation
And peace for ages
Standing in the summer breeze
Inhaling life again
A new day has come
A chance to relive
Forget and forgive
Somehow I wasted all
They sealed my voice and wisdom
But my soul was born
On the battleground
Justice and blood
Long awaited fix of me
And tonight you die
In hell
I bind my eyes
Inside my mind
We're bound together
This is my confession
So may your enemy
Alone in my religion
Release my heart
Unfold my tongue
Save a place for me in heaven
We'll meet another day
I found forgiveness
And the meaning of it all
My fear is gone
Gone
Forget and forgive
Silverthorn
Curse or repayment?
Truth or illusion?
In my noble asylum
When dark hours linger
The sinister silence
Is bowed into millions of tears
The sweetness of sound
Turns to raging thunder
A deadly serenade
In the moonlight, the bringer of pain
Like fear on a silver plate
I am frozen, betrayed by myself
When will this end?
Same old pavilion
A different appearance
Is playing messiah
All good was taken
A thorn made of silver
Abandoned my will to go on
The sweetness of sound
Turns to raging thunder
A deadly serenade
In the moonlight, the bringer of pain
Like fear on a silver plate
I am frozen, betrayed by myself
When will this end?
Life is a flower, fading away
We are not destined to stay
Love is forever, the spirit is free
Time is a borrowed gift for you and me
The sweetness of sound
Turns to raging thunder
A deadly serenade
In the moonlight, the bringer of pain
Like fear on a silver plate
I am frozen, betrayed by myself
A deadly serenade
In the moonlight, the bringer of pain
Like fear on a silver plate
I am frozen, betrayed by myself
Everything comes to an end
Falling Like The Fahrenheit
Let me play a melody for you
While searching for the light
And a way to live forever
Your flaws make sure you never contemplate
And see the consequence
Of trying to survive
Like the shadows in my head
You will play that ghost again
(Do you think salvation waits for you?)
As I lay you down to sleep
All your tears are mine to keep
Falling like the Fahrenheit
Someone will always lose
You will never see another sunrise
My cyanide in paradise
That someone's always there
And I will never see another sundown in your eyes
Let me share a memory with you
Imprisoned in the sound
Let us dream away together
Every single note is bound to send
A flower from this world to whither with a smile
Give me a sign
To take what is righteously mine
Give me the secrets that you keep
I'll save them for no one else to see
Solitaire
On a dim December morning
A glass of "I forgot the name"
I can't turn wine to water
I won't come back again
And the minutes turn to hours
I keep spinning cards that look the same
And I so await the moment...
To talk to you
Please shine oh night my dear, embrace me
It's time again,
All light is banned
My soul is free
And blessed to see
Sometimes when I'm out of reach
And sometimes when I'm there
That is when our souls agree and join in solitaire
Sometimes when my will to love has gone away
That is when I hear your name
Now the pale sunlight is blinding
It's here to claim my sanity
And I just can't stand the waiting...
To revive ecstasy
Please shine oh night my dear, embrace me
It's time again
All light is banned
My soul is free
And blessed to see
I won't sustain another day
My love, my darkness
Daylight reflects my starving soul
And open wounds for everyone to see
I want to hear your name
Hear your name
Prodigal Son
Essence of beauty
Taken to soon
Princess of hope
Deep in our hearts you live on
Essence of goodness
Goddess of light
Give us the power
God gave us strength to live on
Essence of beauty
Taken too soon
Princess of hope
Deep in our hearts you live on
Essence of goodness
Goddess of light
Give us the power
God gave us strength
Give us the strength to live on
(How could this happen
What have we done)
How could this happen?
Oh, what have we done?
Will our tears ever pay for our sin?
Mother forgive us
We need all your love
To fight and to carry the burden of shame
Hereby we swear that for as long as we live
We will not soil our name
The truth made of iron
Will see it with pain until death
Our secret remains
Until death our love remains
And in death our love re-framed
I need a way
But worlds unwind
Lovers in blood
Now divided in heart
My grief and sorrow always trying
To repay
Behind the palisade
This is destined life
Music and the tears I hear you say
Through the walls
Turns to nightmares and there's no escape at all
Oh joyful childhood
You died so young
Every child follows blind
On the journey we call life
Learn it every day
Given love or given name
Determines everybody's fate in life
Be careful what you give
Stranger to love and affection
On the run
In search of shelter in the solitude of sin
A drifter in the dark
A soldier of the pain
A constant slave under the belt of misery
Oh joyful childhood
You died so young
Every child follows blind
On the journey we call life
Learn it every day
Given love or given name
Determines everybody's fate in life
Be careful what you give
Continuum
Grace
Watch me passing through
Your odd dimension
You’re standing there
Carrying the cross that I gave
I’m a northern light
The stars above you
I whisper your name
Oh, feeling strange
You’re falling down from grace
And feeling kinda strange
It’s not over
You’re falling down from grace
And feeling kinda strange
It’s not over
Come and breathe inside
My celestial sphere
Feel the rush in your fragile flesh
I can feel your anxiety
Restless mind
Searching for love to embrace
You’re falling down from grace
And feeling kinda strange
It’s not over
You’re falling down from grace
And feeling kinda strange
It’s not over
Don’t despise me
I am the truth
Don’t be indifferent
You won’t be condemned
Will I ever reach you
If I open my arms
You lose, you die
Turning my heart into stone
You’re falling down from grace
You’re feeling kinda strange
It’s not over
You’re falling down from grace
And feeling kinda strange
It’s not over
Leaving Too Soon
Close your eyes and count to ten
I dare you
I will catch your fall
It takes a dreamer to believe
Make a wish and take a stand
I promise the world to you
The sun will paint your face with gold
Saying you don't have to live afraid
Because we're all leaving too soon
In a moment of sobriety we learn to see
We are not meant to stay for eternity
Don't use the time you have to dream away
Weigh the future in your hand
Tomorrow, today has gone to sleep
Only to wake up yesterday
Cross the borders of your land
The soil beneath will crumble
The sun will light the fire in your eyes again
Saying you don't have to die afraid
Because we're all leaving too soon
In a moment of sobriety we learn to see
We are not meant to stay for eternity
Don't use the time you have to dream away
Because we're all leaving too soon
In a moment of sobriety we learn
We are not meant to stay for eternity
So use the life you have to live your dream
Fallen Star
You are my reason to stay
Even if daylight’s a lifetime away
May the kings and the queens of the dawn
Remember my name
As dark as the fallen star
My song for the children unforgiven
Sometimes the weight of the world’s
Coming over me
A feeling I can’t forget
Sometimes I find myself caught in a storm
And my future’s a nightmare away
When I’m dreaming
Sometimes I fear
I am losing your sympathies
A liar demands respect
Sometimes I fell I am losing control
And feed on the absence of love
Walking this world like animals
And into the light we’re fading
You are my reason to stay
Even if daylight’s a lifetime away
May the kings and the queens of the dawn
Remember my name
As dark as the fallen star
My song for the children unforgiven
Sometimes I’m lost in the silence of empathy
A moment I can’t reflect
Sometimes I feel like I’m loosing control
And feed on the essence of hate
Walking this world like animals
And into the dark we’re wading
You are my reason to stay
Even if daylight’s a lifetime away
May the kings and the queens of the dawn
Remember my name
As dark as the fallen star
My song for the children unforgiven
Somewhere in time
A story seldom told
Somewhere in history
Our destiny behold…
In the dead of the night I’m just a corpse
Awoken the enemy sleeping inside
In the eye of the storm we’re just the same
'cause you are my reason to stay
Even if daylight’s a lifetime away
May the kings and the queens of the dawn
Remember my name
As dark as the fallen star
My song for the children unforgiven
My song for the lost
My song for the children unforgiven
Insomnia
When the darkness brings the cold
To draw me under
I am caught between
The chapters of a dream
Something is reaching out and
My entire world is crumbling
And it whispers that I am
The chosen one…
Can you hear me…?
When the night begins to fall
I watch the shadows growing tall
Feeding my insomnia
Like a fly on the wall
I’m asleep but wide awake
A nightmare on repeat
In the haze I sense
The purpose of my soul
We are all born to leave a
Scar deep in the hearts of many
But can I really trust that I’m
The chosen one
Can you hear me…?
When the night begins to fall
I watch the shadows growing tall
Feeding my insomnia
Like a fly on the wall
When the night begins to fall
I hear a thousand voices call
Chasing my insanity
Like a fly on the wall
My wide eyed confidence
Still echoes in mind
A bright white prophecy
Protector of the light
When the night begins to fall
I watch the shadows growing tall
Feeding my insomnia
Like a fly on the wall
When the night begins to fall
I hear a thousand voices call
Chasing my insanity
Like a fly on the wall
Citizen Zero
I wait to surface
Above these bellowed growls
To sweep the shallows of utopia
I am the anchor
And the rope around your feet
In a river deep I hold you down
I’ve come to stage your abdication
I’m the creation of your sins
Embrace me
When the hounds are out
Feeding me a lie
When the hounds are out
My sickness is released
When the cards are down
For all the world to see
When the cards are down
And the strings are cut
These mannequins will sleep
In the center
Of your greed infected wounds
I am a thorn of endless sorrow
Just one of thousands
In your self selected crown
A king to wallow in the mire
And roll in defeat…
I will protect the incubation
I am your bottomless decease
Embrace me
When the hounds are out
Feeding me a lie
When the hounds are out
My sickness is released
When the cards are down
For all the world to see
When the cards are down
And the strings are cut
These mannequins will sleep
Pater noster
Invidia
Ira gula
Superbia acedia
Luxuria
Avaritia
Pater parce meis peccatis
All I see
Is mine to take
To have and to hold…
To suffocate
All I want
Is mine to keep
And I want it all
So father forgive me…
When the hounds are out
Feeding me a lie
When the hounds are out
My sickness is released
When the cards are down
For all the world to see
When the cards are down
And the strings are cut
These mannequins will sleep
Veil Of Elysium
Hear my promise of blistering light
Sowing a rose of obsidian
My dear I promise
Death comes to all
In a heartbeat only silence
Let's play with the fire that runs in our veins
Trust in the might of a miracle
Now winter has come and I'll stand in the snow
I don't feel the cold
And it's all that I will ever need to believe
One day I know we will meet again
In the shade of a life to die for
Watching the world through the eyes of a child in Elysium
Will I know you then?
(Will I know you then?)
Now bring down your fortress and swallow your pride
Don't break in your moments of ignorance
Existence will capture a spark of life
Just a fragment, but it's all that I will ever need to revive
One day I know we will meet again
In the shade of a life to die for
Watching the world through the eyes of a child in Elysium
Will I find you there in that darkness
Of the shadow that comes over all?
Dear friend will I know you then?
Will I know you then at all?
One day we'll meet
(One day we will meet in the shade of a life)
In the shade of a life to die for
(Watching the world)
Watching the world through the eyes of a child
Will I know you then?
One day I know we will meet again
In the shade of a life to die for
Watching the world through the eyes of a child in Elysium
Will I know you then?
Will I know you then?
Under Grey Skies
In the ruins of madness
A ghost of a chance
There is new hope reborn in every tragedy
And the world I see bares
A mystery waiting to be revealed
And don’t you know that
Every cloud has a silver lining
You may call me a dreamer
Call me a fool
Just a blue eyed believer in you
In the age of confusion
Tears and despair
Let me sell you a dream of prosperity
In this great illusion
Our humble intentions are well concealed
'Cause don’t you know that
Every cloud has a silver lining
You may call me a dreamer
Call me a fool
Just a blue eyed believer in you
But I’ll die for that someone
In the blink of an eye
So tell me… please tell me
Just what kind of fool am I...
When I drown in my fears
In the darkness of sorrow
There’s a promise of grace
Under silver grey skies
And I’m drying my tears
In the blaze of the sunlight
A reviere sealed with a kiss
You may call me a dreamer
Call me a fool
Just a blue eyed believer in you
But I’ll die for that someone
In the blink of an eye
So tell me… please tell me
Just what kind of fool am I...
You may call me a dreamer
Call me a fool
Just a blue eyed believer in you
But I’ll die for that someone
In the blink of an eye
So tell me… please tell me
Just what kind of fool am I…
What kind of fool am I….?
My Therapy
When the bliss of salvation has come
I don’t mind silence and my fear is gone
It’s the chemical way to serenity
It’s faith versus science
Who fears the ticking of the clock
When centuries are passing in seconds
Black is the color of my past
A product of society’s abuse
Come and take me off my daily dose of pain
Take me off and shelter me
From this static nothing
You’re the antidote
For solitude injected in my veins
May the touch of your hand
forever be my therapy
I need your voice to fill the void
A lullaby to sooth my rejection
Pure disinfection of the heart
Before this silence tears my soul apart
Come and take me off my daily dose of pain
Take me off and shelter me
From this static nothing
You’re the antidote
For solitude injected in my veins
May the touch of your hand
forever be my therapy
I walk alone
On the path of self-extinction
With all these chains to pull me down
Come at night
Luminate my inner chambers
And leave the light on when you go
Please don’t go…
Come and take me off my daily dose of pain
Take me off and shelter me
From this static nothing
You’re the antidote
For solitude injected in my veins
May the touch of your hand
forever be my therapy
Come and take me off my daily dose of pain
Take me off and shelter me
From this static nothing
You’re the antidote
For solitude injected in my veins
May the touch of your hand
forever be my therapy

End Of Innocence
Tell me do you remember
The games and the laughter
Far from the choices we’d have to make
A kiss on the lips
Turned the toad to a prince
And the end was a lifetime away
I pour myself onto this page
I am writing a swan song for ages
I will leave it behind
And just maybe you will
Remember me…
It’s the end of an innocent era
The beauty we know will be lost
We are building a bridge
Between heaven and hell
To return again
And why must a hero die young
Not to be gone and forgotten
So I pray for the broken
This is not the end of innocence
Now it’s me and my knife
And the will is my temple
Numb from the choices I have to make
Slowly we all took a bite of the apple
And laughter’s a lifetime away
Remember me…
I pour myself onto this page
I am writing a swan song for ages
I will leave it behind
And just maybe you will
Remember me…
It’s the end of an innocent era
The beauty we know will be lost
We are building a bridge
Between heaven and hell
To return again
And why must a hero die young
Not to be gone and forgotten
So I pray for the broken
This is not the end of innocence
Of innocence…
Where do we go from here…?
It’s the end of an innocent era
The beauty we know will be lost
We are building a bridge
Between heaven and hell
To return again
And why must a hero die young
Not to be gone and forgotten
So I pray for the broken
This is not the end of innocence
Beautiful Apocalypse
Gravity is pulling me
And I don’t really wanna be
A child of desolation anymore
My inner world is quaking
So tired of my trivial self
A paradise corrupted to the core
Standing on the edge…
 
Something old and
Something new
Something borrowed
Something blue
It’s time for us to celebrate
Our beautiful apocalypse
 
Always know that you are not alone…
Take my hand
My gutter child adventure
I’ll take you where the lovers go to sleep
My borderline affection
Now close your eyes, don’t be afraid
You’re not alone…
 
Tumbling in the multitude
On our way to new horizons
Drowning in a mass of refugees
Liberation in demise
Revolution in disguise
Failing to survive these battlefields
We’re standing on the edge
Something old and
Something new
Something borrowed
Something blue
It’s time for us to celebrate
Our beautiful apocalypse
 
Always know that you are not alone…
Take my hand
My gutter child adventure
I’ll take you where the lovers go to sleep
My borderline affection
Now close your eyes, don’t be afraid
You’re not alone…
You are not alone…
My gutter child adventure
You are not alone
I’ll take you where the lovers go to sleep
My borderline affection
Cause you are not alone
 
Take my hand
My gutter child adventure
I’ll take you to a place where lovers leap
Now close your eyes, don’t be afraid
You’re not alone…
Liar Liar (Wasteland Monarchy)
Would you pray if I said you were dying
Would you be a little stronger
Or fall down on your knees
Would you stay with me
If you knew that I was lying
Would you walk away
Or turn the other cheek
I tremble where I stand
My wish is your command
The nature of a truly desperate heart
Give me something real
That I can truly feel
Liar liar on the wall
Whisper whisper in the dark
Tell me what you see
Poisoned by your fly infested poetry
Liar liar on the wall
Give the world to me
A wasteland or a monarchy
Liar liar
Tell me what you see…
Now I’m here and my pain is my companion
Now I know it wasn’t meant to heal… the cut
Is way too deep
No more wasted years of sacrificial bleeding
I’m the master of the war inside me
But still… I tremble where I stand
My wish is your command
The yearning of an undiscovered soul
Give me something real
So that I can truly feel
Liar liar on the wall
Whisper whisper in the dark
Tell me what you see
Poisoned by your fly infested poetry
Liar liar on the wall
Give the world to me
A wasteland or a Monarchy
Liar liar…
Tell me what you see…
I shine when the sun is down
And carry this heavy crown
I won’t compromise
Release me
What we’re looking for
Liar liar on the wall
Mirror mirror in the dark
Tell us what we are looking for
Make us see the truth
Liar liar on the wall
Whisper whisper in the dark
Tell me what you see
Poisoned by your fly infested poetry
Liar liar on the wall
Give the world to me
A wasteland or a monarchy
Liar liar…
Tell me what you see…
Here's To The Fall
I am your god
Tell me what’s on your mind
My demons are haunting me
Eating me alive
I fear the unknown
The darkness before me
Will we ever start anew
Wait and you will see…
 
Here’s to the fall
The fall of us all
Are we nothing but leaves in the wind?
Here’s to the fall
Here’s to the darkness to come for us all
Turning day into night
 
When I’m weak in my faith
Will you still believe in me?
My cynical imagery
Feeds my disbelief
And when I’m lost in the dark
Will you still save me?
God why won’t you answer me…
What is left to see?
 
Here’s to the fall
The fall of us all
Are we nothing but leaves in the wind?
Here’s to the fall
Here’s to the darkness to come for us all
Turning day into night
 
Help me to see
Through your masquerade like
Perfect disguise
Open my eyes
Help me to see
Here’s to the coming fall…
 
Here’s to the fall
The fall of us all
Are we nothing but leaves in the wind?
Here’s to the fall
Here’s to the darkness to come for us all
Turning day into night
May our souls survive…
Revolution
I stand before you blood of mine
A simple man of simple words
I expect no songs of praise when I am dead
Let my lament of endless gray
Light a fire in your hands
To forge a future we can call our own
So rise to the sound of revolution
Revolution
Elevation to a higher ground
Revolution
The last solution for our kind
I speak to you
The chosen ones
With all our strength we stand aligned
The pending birth of war will break the silence
A second chance will wait for us
To redeem us from our craving
And the thirst for what was once forbidden
We are breaking the walls from inside
So rise to the sound of revolution
Revolution
Elevation to a higher ground
Revolution
The last solution for our kind
Citizen zero…
Are you ready for the war…
Crows… cluster… riot!
Burn… the cage… down… riot!
Stand in the ashes
The echoes of our past
The smoke has cleared
There are shards of broken mirrors
Everywhere
We are standing at the crossroads
Afraid but not alone
A thousand missing faces
A story of a rose
In honor of their sacrifice
A new life can be born
I’m grateful and I leave this world
With no regrets at all
As life is pouring out of me
With all the power left in me
I raise my voice…
Revolution
Elevation to a higher ground
Revolution
Retribution
In the sound
Revolution for the human mind
Revolution
The last solution for our kind
Haven
The Ties That Bind
Resurrection in a life beyond the black
I am not afraid
I know what I must do
Preparation for the harvest of my deeds
There is no looking back
Salvation isn’t free
Before my eyes a world benign
I stand to protect what is mine
Word by word and line by line
I follow your voice through the fire
And nothing will disarm my mind
To cut the ties that bind
Jurisdiction to enforce the only truth
And when I say your name
Forgiveness is for me…
Appear before my feverish eyes
I trust you to lead when I’m blind
Word by word and line by line
I follow your voice through the fire
And nothing will disarm my mind
To cut the ties that bind
I have sold my soul
Hesitation’s for the weak
I’m your faithful tool
Dispose of me as you wish
I say your name again and put my blame aside
And I tell myself the end
Will justify my selfish means…
Word by word and line by line
I follow your voice through the fire
And nothing will disarm my mind
To cut the ties that bind
Cause no one can disarm my mind
To cut the ties that bind
At First Light
Breathe...
Help me breathe
I'm shoulder deep in water
Use...
Use me like you want
'Cause I just wanna feel
Another drop
As time goes by
I wait for you
If we lose this moment
How will we ever know
If someone can define our pain?
If we stay in silence
And wait another night
This chance will be forever lost
At first light
If we only had a minute more
Would you waste it here beside me
Or keep it to yourself?
I throw myself down at your feet
And every day I die a little more
For I just wanna feel!
Another drop
As time goes by
I wait for you
If we lose this moment
How will we ever know
If someone can define our pain?
If we stay in silence
And wait another night
This chance will be forever lost
At first light
