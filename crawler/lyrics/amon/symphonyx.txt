From whom the Gods destroy they first make mad
casting shadows on our fears
Malicious designs built strong and iron-clad catostrophic
conclusion, judgement closes near
Chaos sets the stage
bitter mouths of violent rage
spinning webs of timeless confusion
help us find our way
Tonight can we scape from this hell
(seasons ragin - sands of time will fall)
conquer the wicked
tonight can we escape from ourselves
Ten-thousand tyrants preach their treachery
striking down the weary and the wise
Swords of oppression sever the artery
of our freedom - victimized
Chaos sets the stage
bitter mouths of violent rage
spinning webs of timeless confusion
help us find our way
Tonight can we scape from this hell
(seasons ragin - sands of time will fall)
conquer the wicked
tonight can we escape from ourselves
Down-cast jaded - the glory has faded
so close your eyes
(locked in the darkness all your life...)
dream a twisted tale - dark and venomous
(...do you really have a reason not to fell this raging season)
so infamous
Watch the raging inferno of serpents rip the flesh
from all your pride and glory
then you die open your eyes - it's true
Chaos sets the stage
bitter mouths of violent rage
spinning webs of timeless confusion
help us find our way
Tonight can we scape from this hell
(seasons ragin - sands of time will fall)
conquer the wicked
tonight can we escape from ourselves
Premonition
Unlock the doors of silence
scanning eyes turn into stone
pours the wine of hate and enmity
Helpless minds dance in circles
forever frozen within time
then stare into unlit serenity
Endless dreams are all encased in disarray
Through the eyes of time - I see
all the love and tragedy
the breath of fate surrounds me
and bring me to my kness
Through the eyes of time - I see
peace and false tranquility
although my scars - they do
run deep - right here I'll be
Blind visions summond me
return under blackened skies
scorned and scathed by the spirit's song
A shadow forbears warning
reveals a rhyme, then descends
and falls into the black endless sea
Endless dreams are all encased in disarray
Through the eyes of time - I see
all the love and tragedy
the breath of fate surrounds me
and bring me to my kness
Through the eyes of time - I see
peace and false tranquility
although my scars - they do
run deep - right here I'll be
Our inner strenghts will fill our needs
and heal the hearts that still bleed
Through the eyes of time - I see
all the love and tragedy
the breath of fate surrounds me
and bring me to my kness
Through the eyes of time - I see
peace and false tranquility
although my scars - they do
run deep - right here I'll be
Our inner strenghts will fill our needs
and heal the hearts that still bleed
Masquerade
Shackled in darkness - the forbidden portrait confined to
it's frame
Unbroken silence - a total misfortune and shame
Ragin obsession - this mask of oppression, it hides your
agression from view
This tearing suture renounces the love he once knew
Your sacrifice this paradise of innocence
Trust the lie - you falsify the line of truth
You disguise your insolence
Don't deny insanity - mediocrity
Save us from this masquerade of lies
Kings and fools die in ridicule (save us)
Save us from this masquerade of lies
A fallen fortress sees him beneath starless skies
Subsiding deeper - the final farewell in his eyes
Unspoken hero - distrusted and thrusted within surmise
Seizing intrusion to unveil his clever disguise
Your sacrifice this paradise of innocence
Trust the lie - you falsify the line of truth
Save us from this masquerade of lies
Kings and fools die in ridicule (save us)
Save us from this masquerade of lies
Save us from this masquerade of lies
Kings and fools die in ridicule (save us)
Save us from this masquerade of lies
Absinthe And Rue
In your time of dying don't call my name
so you see me as evil it's just the same
Through the windows in my mind
now you're cast in flames
Absinthe and Rue
twisted wings of paranoia
twilight runs through eyes of ignorance
Afflicted, addicted, and wicked
you'll loom in fear
severed, endeavored in trial
time closes near
Obsessing, possessing, confessing consumed by sin
injected, infected by venom that's searing your skin
Through the windows in my mind
now you're cast in flames
Absinthe and Rue
twisted wings of paranoia
twilight runs through eyes of ignorance
Absinthe and Rue
twisted wings of paranoia
twilight runs through eyes of ignorance
Absinthe and Rue
twisted wings of paranoia
twilight runs through eyes of ignorance
Absinthe and Rue
twisted wings of paranoia
twilight runs through eyes of ignorance
Shades Of Grey
Seasons changing now - summer's come
and I'll be on my own
just bear another day
I have wondered - if I can turn back hands of time
I'll try, just try another way
I don't know why my heart keeps calling,
but I really don't want you to stay
I have my reasons to keep from falling
then cast me into shades of gray
Life's an endless stage - wisdom comes with age,
can't you see what mindless games we play
(So the end)
So the end is near - captured by the spirit in the wind
you keep calling out to me
I'll find my way
I'll wee it through
I don't know why my heart keeps calling,
but I really don't want you to stay
I have my reasons to keep from falling
then cast me into shades of gray
When the curtain falls - I'll hold my head up high
and curse you all
such vicious games we play
I don't know why my heart keeps calling,
but I really don't want you to stay
I have my reasons to keep from falling
then cast me into shades of gray
I don't know why my heart keeps calling,
but I really don't want you to stay
I have my reasons to keep from falling
then cast me into shades of gray
Taunting The Notorious
Don't give me reasons
why you spread your disease like aplague
Caught up in treason
a faith that's misleading and vague
It's so sad our world is breaking down
feeling desires, desires are set in my mind
Your corrupted ways
my sarcastic daze
Parasites infecting us
savage and notorious
Lost in the kingdom
kingdom of pain and my spite
whirlwind of power
power controllng my mind
It's so sad our world is breaking down
feeling desires, desires are set in my mind
Your corrupted ways
my sarcastic daze
Parasites infecting us
savage and notorious
Your corrupted ways
my sarcastic daze
Parasites infecting us
savage and notorious

Rapture Or Pain
A tearless stare
encased by fear
like a thread my heart is torn
and ripped right from my soul
with no control
Suits in disguise then fades to red
brings a blackened sky to fall
and make you very cold
while you grow old
Gone whithout a trace (gone)
it's left me chained and bound
my heart you thrust a dagger
my life and dreams are shattered
and left in tyranny
Rapture or pain
you spill my blood and take my life away
rapture or pain
all adversions still remain
You've realized
you're not alone
they've took your breath of life
and left your mind to unfold
lifeless and cold
Your thoughts erased
it's death you taste
your searing face
it hides the scars of love
Gone whithout a trace (gone)
it's left me chained and bound
my heart you thrust a dagger
my life and dreams are shattered
and left in tyranny
Rapture or pain
you spill my blood and take my life away
rapture or pain
all adversions still remain
Rapture or pain
you spill my blood and take my life away
rapture or pain
all adversions still remain
Thorns Of Sorrow
Beckoning me through aeons of time - captured by you
in dismay
I try to elude these prisions of flesh - but return to
shattered domains
There's no image in the mirror
Shattered glass impales my soul
She's like thorns of sorrow - ripping through my head
She's like thorns of sorrow - visions turning red
Enchanting me - defying my love - I'm hindered with
penance and pain
False reflection of grandeur and light - leaves my heart
bleeding and stained
There's no image in the mirror
Shattered glass impales my soul
She's like thorns of sorrow - ripping through my head
She's like thorns of sorrow - visions turning red
She's like thorns of sorrow - ripping through my head
She's like thorns of sorrow - visions turning red
She's like thorns of sorrow - ripping through my head
She's like thorns of sorrow - visions turning red
A Lesson Before Dying
A chill grows near you're faced with fear
a darkened day you'll see it clear
your shadows call while you stand tall
watch before me while you fall
Times are changing, rearranging
where's the answer we've all been looking for
transient dreaming do you believe in
I am the answer to it all
where are you heading to time will tell
to a destiny that fate knows well
so fly away
Victim of the silence - wipe the cob - webs from your eyes
beware the season - the lies, the treason, the pain
You're running in reverse now - while struggling to break
free
the path you strayed from can only lead to dismay
Living a timeless tale
Behold the truth unveiled
Passion and glory fill my heart
Knowing my fate
Nightmare of fantasy
Untrue reality
Learning the lesson
as we fight to stay alive
Awakened by the thunder - crashing conscience
through your mind
persistent voices - all evils call out your name
Tears can break the silence - let your doubts
and fears be heard
You're releasing inned peace from your soul
Marching on staff in hand
falling into darkness
carry on through the endless nights calling
Living a timeless tale
Behold the truth unveiled
Passion and glory fill my heart
Knowing my fate
Nightmare of fantasy
Untrue reality
Learning the lesson
as we fight to stay alive
Crying downs your doubts and fears
they say that time just might heal the wounds of love
it replaces shattered traces of dispair
looking out through all the years
they say that time just might heal the wounds of love
it replaces
Love will light the darkness there
bringing some hope into view
it replaces the nameless faces of loneliness that you once
knew
Marching on staff in hand
falling into darkness
carry on through the endless nights calling
Living a timeless tale
Behold the truth unveiled
Passion and glory fill my heart
Knowing my fate
Nightmare of fantasy
Untrue reality
Learning the lesson
as we fight to stay alive
Passing through the void
The darkest grand illusion
Chaos is riding on the wind
Destroyed in agony
They create a maddened lair
Summon all to heed their cry
Innocence fading away
- the dying eyes of prey
Desperate cries, hail of fire deciding
All our fate in the night
Tempt in sin, shadows then begin to
Gather the souls they hold within
Victims of desire
Pestilence of their invasion
Forms then take on evil waves
Paralyze, victimize
The shadows fall and enter fast
from the sky - (from the sky)
Summon all to heed their cry
Innocence fading away
- the dying eyes of the prey
Desperate cries, hail of fire deciding
All our fate in the night
Tempt in sin, shadows then begin to
Gather the souls they hold within
I've betrayed - slowly fade
I repent my inner plea
I've denied - sanctified
Cannot hide form this
monstrosity
I'm immersed in a curse
Of this jaded imagery
Realize that your cries
Only jeopardize this legacy
Desperate cries, hail of fire deciding
All our fate in the night
Tempt in sin, shadows then begin to
Gather the souls they hold within
Sea Of Lies
Today I've seen the shallow face I wear
Inside this shell,
a living hell endures
I'm held captive by my fear,
decaying hope and wasted years
The knife of time carves another
line around these eyes
Good and evil - lust primeval
Dragging me into a sea of lies
Losing faith in who I am
Never changing just rearranging
my life again
Through into an eternal abyss I fall,
Silent screams through paper walls
I pray someday the sun will shine
on me again (shine on me again)
Good and evil - lust primeval
Dragging me into a sea of lies
Lies ... lies ...
Lies ... lies ...
Out Of The Ashes
In the house of my master
Behind the gate there is a bed
Oh, I hear laughter
I forged the iron bars that
someday will imprison me
Ooh, mother will you help me
Mother will you help me
To find a reason to go on
Out of the ashes of my youth
- I rise a man
And through the eyes of truth
- I finally understand
The way
I've been beaten with his words
and whipped with his lies
He will not break me down no
matter how hard he tries
Pray for my lost soul
Out of control the storm inside
me rages on and on and on
Mother will you help me
Mother will you help me
To find a reason to go on
Out of the ashes of my youth
- I rise a man
And through the eyes of truth
- I finally understand
The way
Out of the ashes of my youth
- I rise a man
And through the eyes of truth
- I finally understand
The way
The Accolade
Into the morning sun
Down his chosen road he rides to
save the world
Cross of crimson, robe of white
Sworn to the quest for the rest of
his life
Play shields and wooden swords
Slaying dragons as a knight of
Arthur's Court
Trained to kill, to sing a song
Youthful hope to right the wrong
Sons of Antioch
An angel's voice cries out to him
Free the holy lands,
bring peace to it again
Across the seas through sands of time
Knight of the Templar
A charging steed through lands unkind
A legend forever
A heart of gold pumps within his metal skin
A noble line he carries on
Braving the bloody din
Silver spurs are justly earned by
strength within
Squire to knight,
like prince to king
Chalice of life completes the ring
Into the morning sun
Down his chosen road he rides to
save the world
Across the seas through sands of time
Knight of the Templar
A charging steed through lands unkind
A legend forever
To see the light he spent his life
to understand
The sword he once held tight,
falls forever from his hands
Across the seas through sands of time
Knight of the Templar
A charging steed through lands unkind
A legend forever
Pharaoh
Ancient lands, lost in time
Storms of sand, walls of lime
Surround this mask of death I wear
Awakened by intruder souls
The jackal screams as my stone gods behold
Desecraters of Ra
Pharaoh's curse upon you
Who dares to invade his sacred ground
Gods of the Nile arise to strike you down
Forgotten days of my rule, cities
blazed with gold and jewel
Diamond symbol of riches
beyond compare
Now I lay cold in this chamber of
stone
Fools forsaken the wrath of my
throne
Desecraters of Ra
Pharaoh's curse upon you
Who dares to invade his sacred ground
Gods of the Nile arise to strike you down
Mystic gods of the stars
- I summon thee from afar
Sun, moon and earth
- align for my rebirth
I feel the blood flow through my veins
The life force shines on me again
Let the ritual begin
- you will pay for your sins
I am god, I am king of the land
The hour of judgement is at hand
Winds of revenges sweep through the sand
The mighty pharaoh lives again
Pharaoh's curse upon you
Who dares to invade his sacred ground
Gods of the Nile arise to strike you down
The Eyes Of Medusa
Can you look into my eyes
Tell me, now do you somehow
still recognize this stare I wear
Through crystal tears
The light escapes my smile
There is no likeness to be seen,
it is so strange to me
Awaken vindication
The mirrors curse-it besets me
Endless, timeless, faceless terror
To the isle of deadly shores
Sightless, countless, ageless
torture
To behold the sight of Medusa's
eyes
Under a spell - I'm enchanted
The hand of fate is never late to
ring the time
I'm forced to climb the walls
A voice bids last farewell
With no beginning or no end to
be found by me
Endless, timeless, faceless terror
To the isle of deadly shores
Sightless, countless, ageless
torture
To behold the sight of Medusa's
eyes
Endless, timeless, faceless terror
To the isle of deadly shores
Sightless, countless, ageless
torture
To behold the sight of Medusa's
eyes
The Witching Hour
It was seven score and sixteen more
A dreadful scene to behold
Marble silhouettes, white
statuettes
Forever gaze into time
(Caught in a web between life and
death)
Visions dance throughout the
night
In the pale moon light
In the witching hour
Haunting minuet, immortal duet
Dance to the waltz of the souls
Stillness falls upon the aging hall
The fading chimes echo midnight
(Caught in a web between life and
death, life and death)
Visions dance throughout the
night
In the pale moon light
In the witching hour
The Divine Wings Of Tragedy
On the edge of paradise
Tears of woe fall, cold as ice
Hear my cry
Renounce, have you, thy name
Eternal is my pain
Eternal is the pain that leads me
to the thrones of temptation
Eternal is the pain that leads me
to the thrones of temptation ...
There was a time ...
When nine choirs sang the
endless melody of light
Music of the spheres
There was a place ...
Where mortals embraced thunder
and majesty
Their fate lay in our hands
Feel my wings slowly fading -
forever lost in time - I cry
The burning conflict I'm feeling
It summons me to descend into
the other side
And just beyond the stars blazing
A beam light from a red, velvet
moon illuminates me
I will devise, from perfect skies
A dark and vengeful day
Faith and mercy gone astray
With strength of infinite measure
The mighty sword divides order
from chaos in the kingdom below
And from the mansions of glory,
This empty soul cries out one
final plea ...
The end has begun
Our worlds collide, now in
disguise,
You'll feel the Wrath Divine
Tears of woe fall from the sky ...
The prophet cries
Vast battalions rage on in the sky
Rising from the north
- the bringer of war
Eve of destruction
Summon all who have 'power
over fire'
Impending doom from shore to
shore
Standing on the edge of paradise
I sacrifice my truth and loyalty
Seven deadly sins consume you
all, a dance with death
I taste the victory
(Eternal is the pain that leads me to temptation)
Rising from the north
- the warrior prince
Judgement without compassion
eyes of fear
Like the river Styx,
the gates of hell -
"Abandon hope all ye who enter here"
The prophets cry
As armies fall from the edge of
the sky
The Prince of truth, now the
bringer of war
The day of wrath
Banish all kings from the face of the land
Dominion for strength is my
name
Eve of Sacrifice/Armies in the Sky/Dies trae
Looking out on a blue sky
I can see a new world arising
Like a prisoner unbound
I feel the power and the majesty
again
Looking up to the heavens
I can see what I left behind
Beneath the stars, moon and
warm sun
And all I know,
is my paradise has begun ...
Candlelight Fantasia
Just one more night
One more score
Another question in my mind,
can't take no more
Kissing the tears form my face as
they fall
To the ground in silence
in twilight and faded time
Spirits cold, with no love
Bells ring the lonely chime
Candle fires
These lit dreams can't burn alone
Winds of change bring songs
upon my memory
An empty heart and soul
intoxicates me
This darkened page orchestrates
my final destiny
Not knowing what,
what tomorrow will bring
From within the mirrors eyes
I'm forced to run away and hide
I feel those mystic eyes subside
And leave me blind
Through passages in time
I'm prisoned and locked behind the door
Lonely roses slowly wither and die
I can't escape this captive misery
Heart stone cold, under supremacy
Thrown into a raging sea of tyranny
Life's vile walls have tangled me in webs
Eternally caught in my futures threads
Play the violent strings of my symphony
Transcend the absence of this fantasy
Just another vision
Washed away with the tide
No place for forgotten ones
I cannot deny
What lies beyond, beyond this fantasy
From within the mirrors eyes
I'm forced to run away and hide
I feel those mystic eyes subside
And leave my blind
Through passages in time
A prisoner locked behind the door
Lonely roses slowly wither and die
Shackled in darkness
- the forbidden portrait confined to it's frame
Unbroken silence
- a total misfortune and shame
Raging obsession - this mask of oppression
it hides your aggression from view
This tearing suture renounces
the love he once knew
Your sacrifice this paradise of innocence
Trust the lie - you falsify the line of truth
You disguise your insolence
Don't deny insanity - mediocrity
Save us from this masquerade of lies
Kings and fools die in ridicule (save us)
Save us from this masquerade of lies
A fallen fortress sees him beneath starless skies
Subsiding deeper - the final farewell in his eyes
Unspoken hero
- distrusted and trusted within surmise
Seizing intrusion to unveil his clever disguise
Your sacrifice this paradise of innocence
Trust the lie - you falsify the line of truth
Save us from this masquerade of lies
Kings and fools die in ridicule (save us)
Save us from this masquerade of lies
Save us from this masquerade of lies
Kings and fools die in ridicule (save us)
Save us from this masquerade of lies
A Winter's Dream - Prelude (Part I)
Although your words are empty,
I can hear now, what you feel inside
The night is drawing closer,
you fell you have to hide.
Your fears are never wrong or right
Everything is either black or white.
It's time to close your eyes now,
begin your fantasy - what does it mean?
Wake your dreams (commence now...)
into reality.
Your fears are never wrong or right
Everything is either black or white.
In a Winter's Dream - I'll be there for you
In a Winter's Dream - I'll be there for you
The Damnation Game
Forever cursed by this game, he who plays with sin
Incantations summoned up our creations
We're players cast in this tale, believe it
stranger than fiction
This justice thunders our condemnation
Falling into innocence by a shadow's kiss
He speaks what mortals dare to say, will he betray?
If you dare play the game - your descent preordained
from their fiery thrones screaming,
cursing your name
On the terror it breeds - breathing fire and greed
watch him jest as you bleed...
Screaming enter the Damnation Game
We can not keep our heads clear,
or our tongues from evil
by this sword, certain death at our own hands
To have no wants is divine - untrue!
platinum waves tainted gold, we can only watch from
the shores
Falling into innocence by a shadow's kiss
He speaks what mortals dare to say, will he betray?
If you dare play the game - your descent preordained
from their fiery thrones screaming,
cursing your name
On the terror it breeds - breathing fire and gree
watch him jest as you bleed...
Screaming enter the Damnation Game
If you dare play the game -
your descent preordained
from their fiery thrones screaming,
cursing your name
On the terror it breeds - breathing fire and greed
watch him laugh as you bleed...
Screaming enter the Damnation Game
Dressed To Kill
Dark desires of the cynic queen
laughter echoes her name
He feels his breath decay
Opens the past to an empty page
Watch his life drain away
Arrival - dressed to kill, scarlet memories
Watching and waiting for curtains to fall
Arrival - dressed to kill, it's a tragedy
Could you feel sympathy or pain?
In a desolate room, the canvas bleeds
He slides through his chair
rendered prince of fools
Dire thoughts of her begotten son,
Watch his life drain away
Watch his life fade away
Arrival - dressed to kill, scarlet memories
Watching and waiting for curtains to fall
Arrival - dressed to kill, it's a tragedy
Could you feel sympathy or pain?
Arrival - dressed to kill, scarlet memories
Watching and waiting for curtains to fall
Arrival - dressed to kill, it's a tragedy
Could you feel sympathy or pain?

Smoke And Mirrors
It's all perpetual dreams, this hidden life ain't what it seems
Walking dead we are
Victims of misfortune and lies, and tortured bringers of demise
Circling above like vultures
They reap the harvest that we sew and take, like trusting fools
Promising charade
All days now disappear from weeks to months, from months to years
Forever bound, shackled to the wall
The night falls, I've seen 1moons rising in the sky
The night calls, I feel the midnight as it slowly cloaks my eyes
Touched by the kiss of the sunrise
Live with shadows and fears--behind smoke and mirrors
Try to turn back the years--living inside smoke and mirrors
Sacred and serpentine, a hypnotizing twisted theme
Weaves our souls to roar
Like candles in the wind, our echoed cries above the din
Fade into this faceless sculpture
In the wheel of chance and fate, spinning as we watch and wait
A mystery to us all
On the edge of sanity, we tread the seas of destiny
Forever bound, silent voices call
The night falls, I've seen 1moons rising in the sky
The night calls, I feel the midnight as it slowly cloaks my eyes
Touched by the kiss of the sunrise
Live with shadows and fears--behind smoke and mirrors
Try to turn back the years--living inside smoke and mirrors

Oh.....the night calls
Through The Looking Glass (Part I, II, III)
Look to the other side, reach the undefined
Curious to what she doesn't know
Step through the empty air, reveal what wasn't there
A fantasy-her looking glass world
Is it as it seems? Or just a dream within a dream
(dream within, dream within a dream)
Like she's been here before, locked behind the door
Held within the grasp of mystic hands
Everything's so strange, the same but rearranged
Through a bird's eye view-Can it all be true?
The final answer she seeks, with the three to be crowned Queen
Essence of rule divides the land-YEAH!
Dark shape, above in the sky, captures her prismatic eye
Again she walks in wonder, With no, with no tearful good-byes
Alice...Alice...Run Alice...Run
And there she stood, in misery
Searching for the final ring within
A dream, (dream within a dream)
Dream within a dream
"I'm not afraid..."
Scepter in hand-all the numbers so deceiving
The small dreaming child who wears the crown
Watches the pieces falling down
Like knights in the game-her next move is so unsure
'Waken the Queen of Nevermore
Hidden behind the royal doors
White on her right, Red on her left
Talking in riddles, on ears fallen deaf
"Stop with all the lies", all the questions so confusing
Answer the riddles they deny, losing hope, the child cries
Dream on...
Do you believe...all the things that you're seeing are true?
The start's where the end's leading you
Do you believe...all's as twisted as one would perceive?
Seek the answers...and soon you'll believe
The royal child, in a rage of desperate fury
Shattering all that lies before, screaming dolls fall to the floor
Now remove the masque, that's obscuring this dimension
Illusions so clear to me now, her invention is unwound
Escape the dream- like an unwritten book
There at my feet-lies the knight, the queen and the rook
Dream on...
Do you believe...all the things that you're seeing are true?
The start's where the end's leading you
Do you believe...all's as twisted as one would perceive?
Seek the answers...and soon you'll believe

Prelude
In articulus sic aeternus - Spiritus
donec dies fas
Dies Irae, Dies Illa - Solvet saeclum in
favilla
(Born) into the moment that is Forever -
To breath until that fateful day
Day of Wrath, Day of Burning - All the
world to ashes turning...
Evolution (The Grand Design)
Born from the light - journey into the
moment, delivered from thought and
sky
He will be one, one with the land -
Lord of wind and the sea and the sands
The one - The bringer of life
"All will bear a part of me - let this
hollow shell set your free to live as one"
Here we are - Children of Sun and Stars
the first to know and to understand
Living by the Law of the Ages
prophets and sages - forging Utopia
Great Ptah - Khnemu - sacred priest of
the Temple of Ra and the keeper of
truth
Crystalline spheres, the power of light,
grant us keys to the stars and the
secrets of flight
'Five shall be as One'
"We unlock the mysteries of
knowledge and technology"
Here we are - Children of Sun and Stars
the first to know and to understand
Living by the Law of the Ages
prophets and sages - forging Utopia
'We shall live forever, and cast out
those less divine
Gods we will be - rulers of the sea - in
our Grand design'
Here we are - Children of Sun and Stars
the first to know and to understand
Living by the Law of the Ages
prophets and sages - forging Utopia
Fallen / Transcendence
Alone I walk, among the twisting
shadows
tempted by the ancient magic, the Power
of Five
My desire to mirror my own image -
and I will offer you no soul - offer you no
soul
Tonight Darkness will shadow the Light -
Symmetry divine, there's no force greater
Dividing the Fathers of Time
Feel my hate, I'm banished to this
wasteland
my Serpents plot the overthrow of your
temples and shrines
In the night, my army's rage and fury
burning my
shadow into the land - Vengeance by my
hand
Tonight Darkness will shadow the Light -
Symmetry divine, there's no force greater
Dividing the Fathers of Time
Tonight Darkness will shadow the Light -
Paradise denied - the balance of ages
forever lost in time
Was I sure of my fateful wish to evoke
the night from the day?
Thousands now join as one - be afraid
What have I done? Clouds are dimming
the Sun with his wrath of disease and
decay
This masque of vengeance leads my
death parade
What have I done?
"My shadow burning - my shadow burns
across the land...".
Tonight Darkness will shadow the Light -
Symmetry divine, there's no force greater
Dividing the Fathers of Time
Tonight Darkness will shadow the Light -
Paradise denied - the balance of ages
forever lost in time
Communion And The Oracle
All we know, now has come undone
Balance lost between the Moon and Sun
Hear out prayers - Keepers of the Skies
Divine
Upon us all - let your wisdom shine
Losing faith as the madness prevails
in us all we are searching for a reason,
a need to calm the storm
In our sails - let your winds be strong
Breathe the air around you
The oceans fill your veins and winds
embrace your heart
Feel the change within you
The Sun and Moon align - The Grand
Design awaits a new start
From the skies, looking down on you
Through the clouds tainted crystal blue
"Such advancement, yet lacking the
control,
so unaware of your earthly roles"
Praise this child and the words of her
rhyme
A sacred gift - Magic of the Five will
bring you tranquillity
A new order of equality
Five senses come alive - Five reasons
thrive - Five nations unite - Unite as
one
Night and Day will find a way to keep
the Balance true
Let the Sky and Stars be your guide -
the destination is up to you
Raise our heads up to the Skies
Feel the essence of Time
Changing ways like the shifting tides
In the waves hear the Rhyme
The Bird-Serpent War / Cataclysm
Mocking the ways of Justice - the
Serpent's Dragon - Vultures ride
Storming the Gates of Seven - no mortal
man shall break our stride
Our flames engulf your good works and
our terror reigns supreme
Dark beasts that do my bidding by
thrashing, tearing down your dreams
"Gather 'round chosen people of the
Grand Design
Scorn the prophet's words - 'the device
of our demise'..."
The crumbling earth beneath the
weapon's roar -
Raining fire from shore to shore
Neptune's might - the storming waves
rise to make the Kingdom's grave
And all Atlantis cried - a million souls
crying out
Save the child from the Sea - she must
carry on
The secrets and technology shrouded
deep in mystery -
only One will carry on - Carry on...
On The Breath of Poseidon
Egypt
Endless sands of Alnantees - etched in
gold, a city lost in time
and from the Sea - A Child speaks of
things unseen,
before the King - a teller of the Rhyme
Five align - hidden in the word a
message locked in time
find the Key - it draws the final line
between what is and what should never
be
Gaze in these eyes my child and see -
here by my side, you're destined to be
Fears in the night flee with the Sun - if
we are One
Kingdom of Gold I lay at your feet -
Ruler of Time and Space you will be
Rivers of Truth forever will run - if we
are One
From the ruins of Atlantis, the Lord of
Night rises from the sands
He seeks the one - his serpent's tail and
twisted tongue -
a bringer of War - Destroyer of the land
Five align - hidden in the word a
message locked in time
find the Key - it draws the final line
between what is and what should never
be
"Rise my minions - from within the deep abyss
my disciples - thunder this necropolis"
Gaze in these eyes my child and see -
here by my side, you're destined to be
Fears in the night chasing the Sun - now
we are One
Kingdom of Gold now lay at my feet -
Ruler of Time and Space I will be
Rivers of Lies forever will run - now we
are One
Death of Balance / Candlelight Fantasia
Just one more night
One more score
Another question in my mind,
can't take no more
Kissing the tears form my face as they fall
To the ground in silence in twilight and faded time
Spirits cold, with no love
Bells ring the lonely chime
Candle fires
These lit dreams can't burn alone
Winds of change bring songs upon my memory
An empty heart and soul intoxicates me
This darkened page orchestrates my final destiny
Not knowing what, what tomorrow will bring
From within the mirrors eyes
I'm forced to run away and hide
I feel those mystic eyes subside
Through passages in time
I'm prisoned and locked behind the door
Lonely roses slowly wither and die
The Eyes of Medusa
Can you look into my eyes
Tell me, now do you somehow
still recognize this stare I wear
Through crystal tears
The light escapes my smile
There is no likeness to be seen,
it is so strange to me
Awaken vindication
The mirrors curse-it besets me
Endless, timeless, faceless terror
To the isle of deadly shores
Sightless, countless, ageless
torture
To behold the sight of Medusa's
eyes
Under a spell - I'm enchanted
The hand of fate is never late to
ring the time
I'm forced to climb the walls
A voice bids last farewell
With no beginning or no end to
be found by me
Endless, timeless, faceless terror
To the isle of deadly shores
Sightless, countless, ageless
torture
To behold the sight of Medusa's
eyes
Endless, timeless, faceless terror
To the isle of deadly shores
Sightless, countless, ageless
torture
To behold the sight of Medusa's
eyes
Smoke And Mirrors
It's all perpetual dreams, this hidden life ain't what it seems
Walking dead we are
Victims of misfortune and lies, and tortured bringers of demise
Circling above like vultures
They reap the harvest that we sew and take, like trusting fools
Promising charade
All days now disappear from weeks to months, from months to years
Forever bound, shackled to the wall
The night falls, I've seen 1moons rising in the sky
The night calls, I feel the midnight as it slowly cloaks my eyes
Touched by the kiss of the sunrise
Live with shadows and fears--behind smoke and mirrors
Try to turn back the years--living inside smoke and mirrors
Sacred and serpentine, a hypnotizing twisted theme
Weaves our souls to roar
Like candles in the wind, our echoed cries above the din
Fade into this faceless sculpture
In the wheel of chance and fate, spinning as we watch and wait
A mystery to us all
On the edge of sanity, we tread the seas of destiny
Forever bound, silent voices call
The night falls, I've seen 1moons rising in the sky
The night calls, I feel the midnight as it slowly cloaks my eyes
Touched by the kiss of the sunrise
Live with shadows and fears--behind smoke and mirrors
Try to turn back the years--living inside smoke and mirrors
Live with shadows and fears--behind smoke and mirrors
Try to turn back the years--living inside smoke and mirrors
Oh.....the night calls
Church of the Machine
I'm the master, looking down from the edge of space and time
Flesh and steel intertwined
I am the future, sacrifice your soul and succumb to me
Nailed to your faith, you'll believe
Scream-and no one hears my pleas
Faceless masses falling to their knees
Bow down in the platinum maze
Twilight cathedrals spread the system plague
Forging sacred thrones in the void unseen
Merciless judgement in the church of the machine
Pyramids in the sky, playing out their cosmic games
Rulers of us all, forever cursed we live in pain
Cursed-we live in pain...
The creator, 'Neath the darkened sun, my empires rise
Artificially devised
The destroyer, fierce intentions flow from a virtual rage
Forever lost and enslaved
Total mesh of soul and steel
Life-force force under my command
Twisted baptism of fire
Between machine and man
Scream-and no one hears my pleas
Faceless masses falling to their knees
Bow down in the platinum maze
Twilight cathedrals spread the system plague
Forging sacred thrones in the void unseen
Merciless judgement in the church of the machine
Bow down in the platinum maze

Of Sins And Shadows
Passing through the void
The darkest grand illusion
Chaos is riding on the wind
Destroyed in agony
They create a maddened lair
Summon all to heed their cry
Innocence fading away
- the dying eyes of prey
Desperate cries, hail of fire deciding
All our fate in the night
Tempt in sin, shadows then begin to
Gather the souls they hold within
Victims of desire
Pestilence of their invasion
Forms then take on evil waves
Paralyze, victimize
The shadows fall and enter fast
from the sky - (from the sky)
Summon all to heed their cry
Innocence fading away
- the dying eyes of the prey
Desperate cries, hail of fire deciding
All our fate in the night
Tempt in sin, shadows then begin to
Gather the souls they hold within
I've betrayed - slowly fade
I repent my inner plea
I've denied - sanctified
Cannot hide form this
monstrosity
I'm immersed in a curse
Of this jaded imagery
Realize that your cries
Only jeopardize this legacy
Desperate cries, hail of fire deciding
All our fate in the night
Tempt in sin, shadows then begin to
Gather the souls they hold within
Sea of Lies
Today I've seen the shallow face I wear
Inside this shell,
a living hell endures
I'm held captive by my fear,
decaying hope and wasted years
The knife of time carves another
line around these eyes
Good and evil - lust primeval
Dragging me into a sea of lies
Losing faith in who I am
Never changing just rearranging
my life again
Through into an eternal abyss I fall,
Silent screams through paper walls
I pray someday the sun will shine
on me again (shine on me again)
Good and evil - lust primeval
Dragging me into a sea of lies
Lies ... lies ...
Lies ... lies ...
The Divine Wings of Tragedy
On the edge of paradise
Tears of woe fall, cold as ice
Hear my cry
Renounce, have you, thy name
Eternal is my pain
Eternal is the pain that leads me
to the thrones of temptation
Eternal is the pain that leads me
to the thrones of temptation ...
There was a time ...
When nine choirs sang the
endless melody of light
Music of the spheres
There was a place ...
Where mortals embraced thunder
and majesty
Their fate lay in our hands
Feel my wings slowly fading -
forever lost in time - I cry
The burning conflict I'm feeling
It summons me to descend into
the other side
And just beyond the stars blazing
A beam light from a red, velvet
moon illuminates me
I will devise, from perfect skies
A dark and vengeful day
Faith and mercy gone astray
With strength of infinite measure
The mighty sword divides order
from chaos in the kingdom below
And from the mansions of glory,
This empty soul cries out one
final plea ...
The end has begun
Our worlds collide, now in
disguise,
You'll feel the Wrath Divine
Tears of woe fall from the sky ...
The prophet cries
Vast battalions rage on in the sky
Rising from the north
- the bringer of war
Eve of destruction
Summon all who have 'power
over fire'
Impending doom from shore to
shore
Standing on the edge of paradise
I sacrifice my truth and loyalty
Seven deadly sins consume you
all, a dance with death
I taste the victory
(Eternal is the pain that leads me to temptation)
Rising from the north
- the warrior prince
Judgement without compassion
eyes of fear
Like the river Styx,
the gates of hell -
"Abandon hope all ye who enter here"
The prophets cry
As armies fall from the edge of
the sky
The Prince of truth, now the
bringer of war
The day of wrath
Banish all kings from the face of the land
Dominion for strength is my
name
Eve of Sacrifice/Armies in the Sky/Dies trae
Looking out on a blue sky
I can see a new world arising
Like a prisoner unbound
I feel the power and the majesty
again
Looking up to the heavens
I can see what I left behind
Beneath the stars, moon and
warm sun
And all I know,
is my paradise has begun ...
Smoke And Mirrors

Sonata
Into The Dragon's Den
Placid skies, through crystal gazing eyes
Slaves to our desire, in a ring of smoke and fire
The dungeons call, two faces on the wall
Candles light the way, for a moonlight serenade
Through the nights and days, we will find a way
A way to carry on what we believe
An empty door, ashes on the floor
Hypnotic array of lights, dragons calling throughout the night
Omen in black, chained down to the rack
The end never in sight, soaring through an endless plight
Through the nights and days, we will find a way
Silence fills the shrine, giving us the sign
Forever lost, forever in the dragon's den
Born with second sight, essence burning bright
Forever lost, forever in the dragon's den
Silence fills the shrine, giving us the sign
Forever lost, forever in the dragon's den
Born with second sight, essence burning bright
Forever lost, forever in the dragon's den

The Relic
Silver cross in ancient halls, deep inside the castle walls
Bound to sleep, forever locked in chains
Evil carved into the stone, ancient words they've never known
A serpent's silent shroud still remains
Come with me and I'll make all your wishes come true
Lifting the chains of oppression from you
Wiping away the lines carved in your face
Take the Relic from this place...
Carry on, into the horizon, wielding courage, staff in hand
Journey on, through shadows and dreams, and what lies beyond the guardian's keep
Prey and siege in voiceless woe, who's dust was scattered long ago
Awaken from the dark and endless sleep
Man's desires-now mortal wounds, believing tales and shallow truths
Hardened hearts now tremble in the keep
Trust in me and I'll lay all your nightmares to waste
Take the Relic from this place
Carry on, into the horizon, wielding courage, staff in hand
Journey on, through shadows and dreams, and what lies beyond the guardian's keep
Orion - The Hunter
Child of the oceans I am, walking on the waves
Stirring the pools, I silence and calm the tides to a glaze
Touched by a vision of love, her beauty recognized
Elusive to me, progressions are now violence in disguise
On a quest for light, and braving the seas
Chasing the morning star, wait for me...
Now I'm blinded, this vision I cannot see
I cannot see my future destiny
Ohh...the hunter looks at you with eyes to kill
Praying for your life-the mighty rage against the still
For whom the God's destroy, they first make mad
Receiving the sun, and falling like hourglass sand
Child of the sea I am, in starlight I reside
Glow silver and white, eternal and bright in the sky
On a quest for light, and braving the seas
Chasing the morning star, wait for me...
Now I'm blinded, this vision I cannot see
I cannot see my future destiny
Ohh...the hunter looks at you with eyes to kill
Praying for your life-the mighty rage against the still
Ohh...the hunter looks at you with eyes to kill
Praying for your life-the mighty rage against the still
Ohh...the hunter
Ohh...the hunter
Ohh...the hunter
I'm the hunter
Lady Of The Snow
Garden of ice, ivory trees dimly glow
Maiden in white, led by lanterns of stone
Captured-by the light of moon
Diamonds and Jade-dressed in ashen blue
From the North, a mistress dressed in silvery blaze
The feel of her kiss steals my breath away
In the night, shadows dance through lucid doors
With a pale and frigid gaze
Lady of the snow, calling me
Her silhouette awaits in the cold
A kiss of stone, tempting me
Radiant lady in white, Maiden of the Snow
A winter's stare through veils that still my sight
In the night...she calls
Bound by this passion, I'm begging you please let me go
There is no escaping the feeling, I can't fight anymore
My desire echoes from a tale of ancient lore
As before, mystery fills my eyes
Beauty and bliss, I feel the hands that hold me now
I surrender myself to the night
Lady of the snow, calling me
Her silhouette awaits in the cold
A kiss of stone, tempting me
Radiant lady in white, Maiden of the Snow
A winter's stare through veils that still my sight
In the night...she calls
Lady of the snow, holding me
Her silhouette awaits in the cold
I can't fight anymore
The Damnation Game
Forever cursed by this game, he who plays with sin
Incantations summoned up our creations
We're players cast in this tale, believe it
stranger than fiction
This justice thunders our condemnation
Falling into innocence by a shadow's kiss
He speaks what mortals dare to say, will he betray?
If you dare play the game - your descent preordained
from their fiery thrones screaming,
cursing your name
On the terror it breeds - breathing fire and gree
watch him jest as you bleed...
Screaming enter the Damnation Game
We can not keep our heads clear,
or our tongues from evil
by this sword, certain death at our own hands
To have no wants is divine - untrue!
platinum waves tainted gold, we can only watch from
the shores
Falling into innocence by a shadow's kiss
He speaks what mortals dare to say, will he betray?
If you dare play the game - your descent preordained
from their fiery thrones screaming,
cursing your name
On the terror it breeds - breathing fire and gree
watch him jest as you bleed...
Screaming enter the Damnation Game
If you dare play the game -
your descent preordained
from their fiery thrones screaming,
cursing your name
On the terror it breeds - breating fire and greed
watch him laugh as you bledd...
Screaming enter the Damnation Game
If you dare play the game - your descent preordained
from their fiery thrones screaming,
cursing your name
On the terror it breeds - breathing fire and gree

Dressed To Kill
Dark desires of the cynic queen
laugher echoes her name
He feels his breath decay
Opens the past to an empty page
Watch his life drain away
Arrival - dressed to kill, scarlet memories
Watching and waiting for curtains to fall
Arrival - dressed to kill, it's a tragedy
Could you feel sympathy or pain?
In a desolate room, the canvas bleeds
He slides through his chair
rendered prince of fools
Dire thoughts of her begotten son,
Watch his life drain away
Watch his life fade away
Arrival - dressed to kill, scarlet memories
Watching and waiting for curtains to fall
Arrival - dressed to kill, it's a tragedy
Could you feel sympathy or pain?
Arrival - dressed to kill, scarlet memories
Watching and waiting for curtains to fall
Arrival - dressed to kill, it's a tragedy
Could you feel sympathy or pain?
The Edge Of Forever
Pictures of what used to be,
lie in pieces on the floor
finds himself in an empty room,
her voice calls out to him
he opens the door, but there's no one there
no one there...
Draped in a silken glow of moonlight
through the mist I see, a lucid cathedral appears to me.
pray for a glimpse of touch of sunlight
chain our shadow down, night settles in, my love,
you never make a sound.
Love is flowing from my fingertips
never in control of this domain.
All around me, my essence lay
watch the vultures circle through the pouring rain.
Close your eyes - and try to remember
discordant lullabies of days gone by.
Close your eyes - on the edge of forever
a chance to dream, fast asleep your nightmare ends.
As the walls converge around me.
castles crumbling down, everything is not
as it seems to be.
Once more, I fells I must return
no more will my soul burn. Dawn breaks the ground,
my love,
and with it you fade away...
Close your eyes - and try to remember
discordant lullabies of days gone by.
Close your eyes - on the edge of forever
a chance to dream, fast asleep your nightmare ends.
Close your eyes - and try to remember
discordant lullabies of days gone by.
Close your eyes - on the edge of forever
a chance to dream, fast asleep your nightmare ends.
My love never dies...
Savage Curtain
Besiege me not for what I am
a man with intent in the Devil's den
for I know not what to believe
yet mad I am not in trust I deceive
Radical alterations in my temper
grows worse day by day
I will offer you extreme opposition
Savage curtain closes in on you
but I do grieve the evident
behind this illusion
The fury of demons possessing me
my fiendish corruption will fill my need
every reason to fulfill my deed.
Have we not a perpetual inclination
to violate that witch is law merely
because we know it is to be?
Savage curtain closes in on you
but I do grieve the evident
behind this illusion
Savage curtain closes in on you
but I do grieve the evident
behind this illusion
Whispers
When all the angels cry
sadness reigns upon us all
white doves fade to black
With the absence of the heart
we could never smile
we can feel the bitter tears
Whispers from you - calling out from above
visions I can't see, like the wind and your love
whispers to you - calling out through the night
words I can't hear, graceful figure in white
And when you watch over me
please guide me all the way
you're my judge and my jury
As I lay my head to rest
your absence will surround me
and I'll die another death
Whispers from you - calling out from above
visions I can't see, like the wind and your love
Whispers to you - calling out through the night
words I can't hear, graceful figure in white
Whispers from you - calling out from above
visions I can't see, like the wind and your love
Whispers to you - calling out through the night
words I can't hear, graceful figure in white
The Haunting
Lightning flashes across the sky
the hands of time keep falling like the pouring rain
Soft voice call my name I've seen this place before
This whole thing is mad and still I can see
that he awaits for me
As the knife cuts to the vein
am I going insane? Have I lost my mind?
Ten years gone by, my friend, haunting me
scars will fade but never die
Prisioner waiting out my time
looking back through years gone by
My mind is always wondering what can I do
to seal a different fate,
can I undo the things I've done?
I lie on the ground without making a sound
and cry for my life
again
As the knife cuts to the vein
am I going insane? Have I lost my mind?
Ten years gone by, my friend, haunting me
scars will fade but never die
Staring down at me
through my eyes I can see
al the terror and pain still live on
I can't leave
silver strand is pulling me back to mortality
As the knife cuts to the vein
am I going insane? Have I lost my mind?
Ten years gone by, my friend, haunting me
scars will fade but never die
Secrets
Deep within a tiny box, shadowed truth under the locks
Burns inside your heart - then it starts
Your soul stretched on the rack
the straw that breaks the back
Watch the make-up crack...
Got no peace of mind, now you're going blind
Secrets within, living in sin.
No one needs to know, watch the cancer grow
Feel it eating - Secrets within.
Secrets hurt if they are told, someone's trust you will
have sold - Don't tell a soul.
Hear the cry inside of you, live the lie or speak the
truth - when will it end?
Your soul stretched on the rack
the straw that breaks the back
Watch the make - up crack...
Got no peace of mind, now you're going blind
Secrets within, living in sin.
No one better know, feel the cancer grow
Feel it eating - Secrets within your mind.
Got no peace of mind, now you're going blind
Secrets within, living in sin.
No one needs to know, watch the cancer grow
Feel it eating - Secrets within your mind.

A Winter's Dream - The Ascension (Part II)
Still in bed an hour past,
I'm drifting through the void.
As fallen star divides the sky of divinity.
Taken on a journey,
and enlightened to the past.
And if I wake, if I wake, will it embrace me?
Awoke at dawn to calm the storm inside of me.
Take my last breath as I fall into eternity...
Risen to an astral flight, I wander through
Serene with you.
Answers to the voices I hear,
In a Winter's Dream, a dream.
Empty minds still wait, I'm here.
Captured by light - my spirit rides through the
night.
And if I dream to wake - will it embrace me?
When the story fades and all is said done,
I can not wait - pray for daybreak -
Will it escape me?

Inferno (Unleash The Fire)
Welcome to the Anarchy
Enigmatic entity
The grand illusion - destitution
infecting one and all
Forces they're oppressing me
Lords of mediocrity
an iron will shall break the still
some will rise and some will fall
Oh... yes, we ride through stormy skies of Fire
Evil lies that mesmerize
from the dragons' tongue they slide
a fury lashes from the ashes
never losing sight
Pounding down the wicked ones
Tyrants now are overcome
A final yell from hounds of Hell
rising we unite
Yes we ride through stormy skies
The endless nights
In the moonlight, we do gather
We curse uncertainty and false desires
We lift the mask
and stand together - one and all
and when the flames grow dim, look within
Unleash the Fire...
A time will come
when all will see: In the end - it's just a game
Time will tell
when all these things that have come to pass - still remain
Oh... Yes we ride through stormy skies
The endless nights
In the moonlight, we do gather
We curse uncertainty and false desires
We lift the mask
and stand together - one and all
and when the flames grow dim, look within
Unleash the Fire...
Wicked
Alone I traveled through the mountains
Led by a star fading west
When I came upon an ancient ruin of a church
and it was there I stopped to rest
Then the black and gloomy night that chased my footsteps
crashed down on me like a wave
Whispering through the trees and eerie breeze
carried a voice beckoning me to be her slave
In a whisper she said...
Burn forever
Leave never from my arms
Embrace the night
From the black and twisting shadows rose a woman
beauty alluring to the eye
Oh her devilish grin, her moonlit skin
and long dark hair flowing down around her thighs
As she approached I felt the evil growing stronger
I waltz with the wicked within
Frozen in my place, she kissed my face
and in a storm of passion bathed me in sin
In the madness...she said...
Burn forever
Leave never from my arms
Embrace the night
Then she weaved a mist - and cast me into the shadows
"Come with me, love eternally, forever mine"
"Set me free - in death we'll dance eternally forever and ever..."
As so the light, cast down from the heavens,
washed over me like wave
I awoke, it seems, from some crazy dream
only to find I was standing at her grave
In my nightmare...she said
Burn forever
Leave never from my arms
Embrace the night
Burn forever
Leave never from my arms
Don't ever leave me- never leave me
Burn forever
Leave never from my arms
Embrace the night
Incantations Of The Apprentice
Through eerie reach of ancient woods
where lumbering mists arise
I journey for nines moons of the year
to where a land of legend lies
Deep within a stony lamp-lit hall
under falling grains of sand
Magic eyes glance magic pages
turned by magic hands
And as he spoke I watched in awe
A God's aura in his eyes
Master of all
Darkness fall - Spirits arise
Lord of Storms - Blacken the skies
With heavy breath, I break the seal
howls echo through the room
Blood lettings of a black Raven's heart
Conjure up the wraiths of doom
I cannot heed my Master's call
Lakes of Fire - writhe and swell
Foolish eyes - while spying Prophet's pages
unleash Barons of Hell
And as they rose I watched in awe
A God's aura in my eyes
Master of all
Darkness fall - Spirits arise
Lord of Storms - Blacken the skies
Accolade II
On a cold and misty night,
a ring of torches light the hallowed ground
where his father's laid to rest
In the reflection of the sword
he sees his destiny and he swears up to the sky -
"You will not have died in vain"
On the field - with sword and shield
amidst the din of dying man's wails
War is waged - and the battle will rage
until only the righteous prevail
From the shadows comes a man,
returning to his land - Winds of change
taint the sweet smell of home
And all around him, he can see
the pain and misery
this tyrant's reign is through
"I will stand and fight... Will you?"
A heart of gold pumps within his metal skin
A noble line he carries on
On the field - with sword and shield
amidst the din of dying man's wails
War is waged - and the battle will rage
until only the righteous prevail
I wish to stay...to be here with you
You were my strength...How can I go on?
On the field - with sword and shield
amidst the din of dying man's wails
War is waged - and the battle will rage
until only the righteous prevail
King Of Terrors
I awake - without the sun
encased in walls of steel
terror so real - it blinds me
Rancid darkness steals my breath
The Pit - on the edge of death
The wells of Hell know not my name
I slip away...into black I fade away
Terrified - to the left and to the right
Spirits of the Damned, iron shadows cast
Hear my desperate cries
Shrieking demon - far and wide
praying for this breath to be my last
Awake again - paralyzed
I'm shackled to this alter
sacrificed to their God
'Inch by Inch and Line by Line'
The Blade - descending lost in time
The fiends of Doom they call my name
I slip away... into black I fade away
Terrified - to the left and to the right
Spirits of the Damned, iron shadows cast
Hear my desperate cries
Shrieking demon - far and wide
praying for this breath to be my last
"The Inquisitorial vengeance
had been hurried by my two-fold escape,
and there was to be no more dallying
with the King of Terrors..."
Terrified - to the left and to the right
Spirits of the Damned, iron shadows cast
Hear my desperate cries
Shrieking demon - far and wide
praying for this breath to be my last
The Turning
Lurking out of sight
Night shall fall and feed my frenzy
Beneath an eerie moon a change comes over me
Eyes glow by candlelight
a face divided in the mirror
my psyche ripped by daggers of my alchemy
Side by side with myself again
As midnight's curse descends on trembling hands
Oh - save my soul
losing control when the bells toll
Savage on the prowl
In the lamplight's glow - nocturnal
my breath hangs like ghosts in the evening air
This ill effect - a vile creation
of my design - abomination
the madness rages on and on...
Side by side with myself again
As midnight's curse descends on trembling hands
Oh - save my soul
losing control when the bells toll
Oh - feed my soul
I'm in control - when the bells toll
Oh - save my soul
losing control when the bells toll
Oh - feed my soul
I'm in control - when the bells toll
You'll be forever mine
Awakenings
Needless to say, another day has passed away
Yet everything, and nothing, has changed
Awake I lie, my thoughts get lost up in the sky
Needless to say, nothing will change...
Maybe a mystic - with fortunes to tell...
Surrender my coin at the old wishing well...
Maybe the stars will align in the night...
To show me the path that is right
'Would've been's and 'could've been's
they waste my days away
the colors of my life dissolve and fade to gray
So many paths of promise
Indecision poisons my mind
If only I had seen the signs - so blind
Oh, so blind...
Oh, Yet I must journey on - on and on
A haunting vision torments me
It smothers and steals my dreams
I see an old man in the mirror
cold and bitter starring back at me
Here I am - at the crossing of life I stand
On my own - looking down the road
Hear my cry - answer me
Still I'm searching yet the truth is unknown - though the night is cold
I walk the road alone
The Odyssey
To the one that I love, my journey has begun
When our eyes meet once more there will be peace
The taste of your lips the warmth of your touch
again, forever, two souls as one
Seems like forever that my eyes have been denied
Home - I'm dreaming of the home
I've been twenty years away from all I ever knew
to return would make my dream come true
Seasons of sorrow have stolen all my years
I miss the rolling hills of Ithaca
I've been through battles and cried a sea of tears
but the tide is changing, and with it all my fears
Seems like forever that my eyes have been denied
Home - I'm dreaming of the home
I've been twenty years away from all I ever knew
to return would make my dream come true
Behold the sea and winds of Jove
We set sail guided by the stars above
The ports of Troy escape our view
a cold and stormy fate awaits our rendezvous
Onward we ride, into the raging fury
Setting our course by the moon and sun
We forge ahead seeking glory
Yet the journey has just begun
Onward we ride - nine days we brave her might
we are coming home...
Awakened at dawn - Land dead ahead
with the winds of the morning we change course
no remorse, a place forbidden to all
Search all the grounds - find food and water
Yet journey not into the Cave of Woe
long ago, a legend spoke of a beast
A thousand riches hidden deep within the stone
A thousand nightmares mortal blood forever flows
A mountainous black - engulfed in a shadow
a bone-chilling growl and an Eye of Hate
a ghastly fate - held prisoner by the Eye
Yet he must sleep - as the daylight fades
we focus our senses and sharpen our blade
we take aim - In silence we strike
A thousand riches hidden deep within the stone
A thousand nightmares - blood runs forever - from the Eye...
We sit adrift on the open sea
The gift of wind, by Zeus, concealed - so carelessly
We break the waves on a course untrue
across the endless plain of blue - a new coast in view
Yeah...
We carouse with the maiden
beneath her eyes the madness lies
...in mystery
I drink deep from the chalice
of gold and jade - my senses fade
...I'm mesmerized
Stay - like those before
I condemn you all - from walk to crawl
...metamorphasized
No - my will it defies her
speak the verse - lift the curse
...she's mesmerized
Am I asleep?
Tell me Daughter of the Sun
There's vengeance in the air and all things must be undone
Dire warnings -
told by the sorceress in white
'false bringers of love' - Sirens
echoing songs from above
Wings flowing -
floating on Sea of Lies
I defy their vision
Elysium swallows my cries
Embracing -
maidens of lust stimulate
and manipulate my senses
I welcome a watery grave
Tied steadfast to the mast
tragedy awaits me
I'm falling victim
betrayed by the sea
So this is home...
In the guise of a beggar - Minerva guides my way
I find my kingdom in jeopardy
Vengeance - it swells within me
As I spy so many who eye my Queen
I'll make them pay for this blasphemy... All will see
Triumphant - Champion of Ithaca
I will right all the wrongs
Let the Gods sing my song
Triumphant - Champion of Ithaca
Let a new life begin
my journey has come to and end
A contest of valor
'to pierce all the rings
in a single arrow's flight'
Yet, not a one can string the bow
My veil of silence lifted
All is revealed
revenge burns in my heart
thrashing and slashing down all my foes... to claim the throne
Triumphant - Champion of Ithaca
I will right all the wrongs
Let the Gods sing my song
Triumphant - Champion of Ithaca
Let a new life begin
this is the end of my Odyssey
Seems like forever that my eyes have been denied
Home - I'm finally home
I've been twenty years away from all I ever knew
I have returned to make my dream come true
Masquerade
Shackled in darkness
The forbidden portrait confined to its frame
Unbroken silence
A total misfortune and shame
Raging obsession
This mask of opression
It hides your aggression from view
This tearing suture
Renounces the love he once knew
You sacrifice this paradise of innocence
Trust the lie - you falsify the line of truth
You disguise your insolence
Don't deny insanity - mediocrity
Save us from this masquerade of lies
Kings and fools die in ridicule (save us)
Save us from this masquerade of lies
A fallen fortress sees him beneath starless skies
Subsiding deeper - the final farewell in his eyes
Unspoken hero
Distrust and thrusted within surmise
Seizing intrusion to unveil his clever disguise
You sacrifice this paradise of innocence
Trust the lie - you falsify the line of truth
Frontiers
Yeah yeah
Sailing across the seas far and wide
We alone pierce the gloom of the night
We search for answers to riddles all this time
And with the sunset, our land fades from sight
Heading out (we are)
Far from home (and we)
Seek to conquer the great unknown (the great unknown)
Riding steadfast (on the)
Breath of God
We'll reach for the stars and beyond
Mission status: All systems go
Counting down the engine's light, ooh
Blazing progress, our beacon sears the skies
And with the moonset our planet fades from sight
Heading out (we are)
Far from home (and we)
Seek to conquer the great unknown (the great unknown)
Riding steadfast (on the)
Breath of God
We'll reach for the stars and beyond
Yeah yeah
Ride the night
Heading out (we are)
Far from home (and we)
Seek to conquer the great unknown (the great unknown)
Riding steadfast (on the)
Breath of God
We'll reach for the stars and beyond (Reach for the stars!)
Heading out (we are)
Far from home (and we)
Seek to conquer the great unknown

To breath until that fateful day
Day of Wrath, Day of Burning - All the
world to ashes turning...
Evolution (The Grand Design)
Born from the light - journey into the
moment, delivered from thought and
sky
He will be one, one with the land -
Lord of wind and the sea and the sands
The one - The bringer of life
"All will bear a part of me - let this
hollow shell set your free to live as one"
Here we are - Children of Sun and Stars
the first to know and to understand
Living by the Law of the Ages
prophets and sages - forging Utopia
Great Ptah - Khnemu - sacred priest of
the Temple of Ra and the keeper of
truth
Crystalline spheres, the power of light,
grant us keys to the stars and the
secrets of flight
'Five shall be as One'
"We unlock the mysteries of
knowledge and technology"
Here we are - Children of Sun and Stars
the first to know and to understand
Living by the Law of the Ages

"...and to create entirely new beings was an even greater
display of thier power, but in attempting to merge thier
energies, some of the newly made beings were
disfigured...and there were altered creatures with wings,
hooved legs and tails - part human, part beast.
And they became divided..."
Fallen
Alone I walk, among the twisting
shadows
tempted by the ancient magic, the Power
of Five
My desire to mirror my own image -
and I will offer you no soul - offer you no
soul
Tonight Darkness will shadow the Light -
Symmetry divine, there's no force greater
Dividing the Fathers of Time
Feel my hate, I'm banished to this
wasteland
my Serpents plot the overthrow of your
temples and shrines
In the night, my army's rage and fury
burning my
shadow into the land - Vengeance by my
hand
Tonight Darkness will shadow the Light -
Symmetry divine, there's no force greater
Dividing the Fathers of Time
Tonight Darkness will shadow the Light - 
Paradise denied - the balance of ages
forever lost in time
Was I sure of my fateful wish to evoke
the night from the day?
Thousands now join as one - be afraid
What have I done? Clouds are dimming
the Sun with his wrath of disease and
decay
This masque of vengeance leads my
death parade
What have I done?
"My shadow burning - my shadow burns
across the land...".
Tonight Darkness will shadow the Light -
Symmetry divine, there's no force greater
Dividing the Fathers of Time
Tonight Darkness will shadow the Light - 
Paradise denied - the balance of ages
forever lost in time
"...and there was a need for balance, the
coming of Ma'at.."
Transcendence (Segue)
Communion And The Oracle
All we know, now has come undone
Balance lost between the Moon and Sun
Hear out prayers - Keepers of the Skies
Divine
Upon us all - let your wisdom shine
Losing faith as the madness prevails
in us all we are searching for a reason,
a need to calm the storm
In our sails - let your winds be strong
Breathe the air around you
The oceans fill your veins and winds
embrace your heart
Feel the change within you
The Sun and Moon align - The Grand
Design awaits a new start
From the skies, looking down on you
Through the clouds tainted crystal blue
"Such advancement, yet lacking the
control,
so unaware of your earthly roles"
Praise this child and the words of her
rhyme
A sacred gift - Magic of the Five will
bring you tranquillity
A new order of equality
Five senses come alive - Five reasons
thrive - Five nations unite - Unite as
one
Night and Day will find a way to keep
the Balance true
Let the Sky and Stars be your guide -
the destination is up to you
Raise our heads up to the Skies
Feel the essence of Time
Changing ways like the shifting tides
In the waves hear the Rhyme
"..unfortunately, not all were interested in the
Ways of Justice, and those of the Night
gathered to plot the elimination of the great
Law of One and the death of Ma'at. The
Atlantens harnessed the energy of the great
Crystals to create a weapon of immense power,
unaware that the power they possessed would
ultimately lead to thier downfall..."
The Bird-Serpent War/Cataclysm
Mocking the ways of Justice - the
Serpent's Dragon - Vultures ride
Storming the Gates of Seven - no mortal
man shall break our stride
Our flames engulf your good works and
our terror reigns supreme
Dark beasts that do my bidding by
thrashing, tearing down your dreams
"Gather 'round chosen people of the
Grand Design
Scorn the prophet's words - 'the device
of our demise'..."
The crumbling earth beneath the
weapon's roar -
Raining fire from shore to shore
Neptune's might - the storming waves
rise to make the Kingdom's grave
And all Atlantis cried - a million souls
crying out
Save the child from the Sea - she must
carry on
The secrets and technology shrouded
deep in mystery -
only One will carry on - Carry on...
"...the perservation of Balance was utmost
importance, and cast into the sea was the
child Ma'at, to find a new land...riding on the
breath of Poseidon..."
On The Breath Of Poseidon (Segue)
Egypt
Endless sands of Alnantees - etched in
gold, a city lost in time
and from the Sea - A Child speaks of
things unseen,
before the King - a teller of the Rhyme
Five align - hidden in the word a
message locked in time
find the Key - it draws the final line
between what is and what should never

Gaze in these eyes my child and see -

Fears in the night flee with the Sun - if
we are One
Kingdom of Gold I lay at your feet -
Ruler of Time and Space you will be
Rivers of Truth forever will run - if we
are One
From the ruins of Atlantis, the Lord of
Night rises from the sands
He seeks the one - his serpent's tail and
twisted tongue -
a bringer of War - Destroyer of the land

The Death Of Balance/Lacrymosa
Lacrimosa dies illa,
qua resurget ex favilla
judicandus homo reus
"..tainted memories of Balance lost, forever
bury the truth of all unity..."
Absence Of Light
Now at my feet, the dying voice of
Balance - nevermore shall there be a
way to fly,
a way to fly on wings of Divinity, as
words of wisdom fade away
The Law of One will fade and die
The rising Moon will crush the Sky
So falls the Night - the darkest hour
Seek and find all the secrets left for you
Absence of Light - unbalanced power
Only then will you know
The hidden words - a piece of the
puzzle - Time will tell what will be
Between the lines, the past and future
you will find - the ones and zeros are
the key
to unlock what's sealed
The Law of One will fade and die
The rising Moon will crush the Sky
So falls the Night - the darkest hour
Justice lost - a travesty we must undo
Absence of Light - unbalanced power
Only then will you know
"Awaken all from Set - Amentet -
Worship all that I represent"
So falls the Night - the darkest hour
Destruction, death and war are in the
air
Absence of Light - unbalanced power
ruling all that we know
So falls the Night - the darkest hour
Unbound - what once was lost - now is
found
Absence of Light - unbalanced power
Only then will we know
"...curse the fools who look for enswers in a
Rhyme,...I am the future, I am Montu -
Sekhmet"
A Fool's Paradise
What's become of the world - the colors unfurl revealing a blackened haze
Conditioned to fear the voice that we hear - calling an end of days
Millions of souls under control like pawns to a king, led by a string, to the final hour
Oh - Empire of the Sea,
Lords of technology that fell into the void
Oh shall it be as it was before - a tragedy on every shore?
Is this the end of all we know - innocence lost so long ago
Woven in dreams - the darkest of schemes now takes hold of our destiny
Decades of greed, plague, famine and war - we can't go on like this anymore
living like fools - chaos will rule this eternal paradise
Death by design, altering birth - trends of the modern age
The wisdom of life erased from the Earth - in a reckless rampage
Oh - Empire of the Sea,
Lords of technology bring death unto the earth
Oh shall it be as it was before - a tragedy on every shore?
Is this the end of all we know - innocence lost so long ago
Woven in dreams - the darkest of schemes now takes hold of our destiny
Decades of greed, plague, famine and war - we can't go on like this anymore
living like fools - chaos will rule this eternal paradise
Dies Irae,
Dies Illa,
Solvet Saeclum in favilla
Decades of greed, plague, famine and war - we can't go on like this anymore
Living like fools - chaos will rule this eternal paradise
Is this the end of all we know - innocence lost so long ago
Woven in dreams - the darkest of schemes now takes hold of our destiny
Decades of greed, plague, famine and war - we can't go on like this anymore
Lost in the night - fading from sight - is this the final setting sun?
Rediscovery (Segue)

Seek the hidden words - as time unfolds
you'll find the answers
Feel the mystery - look to the Sea, under
Skies of Hope
What have we done? Can we right all the
wrongs - the evils and fears, for thousands of
years, that forever drain our vitality?
Can this go on without dyer consequence?
Our tragic ways, the end of days that shadow
the dawn of eternity...
He's taken form in human - likeness
and manifests himself in all our darkest
dreams
Preying upon centuries of weakness
Feasting on despair and our own selfish
greed
Bow down to me - (we will never understand)
Then take my hand and you will see - (we'll see...)
you will see paradise - (a paradise?) - of
pain and death
awaiting for you all - (we'll decide the future)
Lost evermore the essence of truth, although
she tried in vein to bring us peace, it will
ever rest in our hands
We've cried a thousand tears for all we had,
and all the things we could have been,
we must find our way again
Fools who looks for answers in a rhyme,
seeking out a lie, an illusion
I am the future, the ageless mutation
Five beyond the skies align, Zeus to Ra - the
final sign
My opposition's drawing near, feeding on his
fear - tasting anguish
I have the power - the ageless invasion
Five beyond the skies align, Zeus to Ra - the
final sign
From the Messenger on Wings, Peace and
War - a line of Kings...
Again the Titans clash on the edge of this
earthen plane
Now from the depths they speak - echoing
from the wave
- From the Waves...
"Choose the way, five paths there for you to find
turn the page, the question lies between the lines can
we change?"
Masquerade '98
Shackled in darkness
The forbidden portrait confined to its frame
Unbroken silence
A total misfortune and shame
Raging obsession
This mask of opression
It hides your aggression from view
This tearing suture
Renounces the love he once knew
You sacrifice this paradise of innocence
Trust the lie - you falsify the line of truth
You disguise your insolence
Don't deny insanity - mediocrity
Save us from this masquerade of lies
Kings and fools die in ridicule (save us)
Save us from this masquerade of lies
A fallen fortress sees him beneath starless skies
Subsiding deeper - the final farewell in his eyes
Unspoken hero
Distrust and thrusted within surmise
Seizing intrusion to unveil his clever disguise
You sacrifice this paradise of innocence
Trust the lie - you falsify the line of truth
Save us from this masquerade of lies
Kings and fools die in ridicule (save us)
Save us from this masquerade of lies
Save us from this masquerade of lies
Kings and fools die in ridicule (save us)
Save us from this masquerade of lies
Overture
Nevermore
From the skies, across the sea of lies
To the dungeons of the damned
Scorching winds blazing thunderclouds raging
Here I make my stand
The viper's venomous bite
Has brought on the night
Swept away, like a bird of prey
Now there's hell to pay
From darkness into light
Nothing matters anymore
My strings ring hollow
Bleeding evermore
Nevermore
Can't let go
Your silences tells me
All I need to know
Nevermore
Strike a chord
The walls of silence fall
Nevermore
Kings of death calling
Frigid breath falling
In the cryptic den
Curse the dark with a
Longing heart and song
You will rise again
On tragic wings I take flight
Bring on the night
Eyes of stone ripping flesh from bone
Into depths unknown
From darkness into light
Nothing matters anymore
My strings ring hollow
Bleeding evermore
Nevermore
Can't let go
Your silences tells me
All I need to know
Nevermore
Strike a chord
The walls of silence fall
Nevermore
Lost in shadows of what might have been
Bloodless spirits wept in fear
The void of anguish slowly pulls me in
"Abandon hope all who enter here"
Nevermore
Can't let go
Your silences tells me
All I need to know
Nevermore
Strike a chord
The walls of silence fall
Nevermore
Nevermore
Nevermore
Underworld
Treacherous words rise from the mist
From envious eyes and poisonous cold, pale lips
Gluttons of pleasure - Gluttons of pain
Vengeance by sevens - My sweet cursed children of Cain
Thrashing and clashing with specters
Hiding from the light - demons of death
Chaos and anguish perfector
Stealing their last dying breath
Driven by greed, slave to addiction
A massive decay of a most foul contradiction
Spirits of lust piercing the air
Writhing with sins of the flesh etched deep in their stare
Descend the abyss ever faster
Hidden from light - demons of death
Cursing the black-winged master
With their last dying breath
Soar through the flame
I call your name
Wrath and might get me through this night
Can I make it right? Or will you remain?
I´ve finally realized, that long after laughter dies
I can't undo the things I've done - oh, the things I´ve done...
When will my dark skies disappear - I long to see the sun
Soar through the flame
I call your name
Wrath and might - get me through this night
Can I make it right? Or will you remain... in hell ?
Without You
Flying into the storm
Hanging on a broken wing
Onto every life
A little rain must fall
Oh, the words I sing
It's a greater thing
To have loved and lost
Than to never, ever
Loved at all
I've come undone
Any fool can see
What's become of me
Sometimes I feel
Feels like there's nothing there
Just an empty stare
Sometimes I feel
Feels like with each passing day
Life just slips away
Without you
Drifting on the sea
A lonely ship without a sail
Sinking like a stone
Drowning in despair
Fighting tooth and nail
Mind the siren's wail
And here comes the night
But the moment's gone without a warning
Or without a prayer
I've come undone
Fearing things unseen
Can I mend this broken dream?
Sometimes I feel
Feels like there's nothing there
Just an empty stare
Sometimes I feel
Feels like with each passing day
Life just slips away
Without you
The days slowly disappear
Time to face my fears
What will be will be
I can't escape
I can't escape my...
My destiny
Sometimes I feel
Feels like there's nothing there
Just an empty stare
Sometimes I feel
Feels like with each passing day
Life just slips away
Without you
Kiss Of Fire
Realms of desolation - where phantoms frighten beasts
Through fiery rain, the screams of pain, eternal, never cease
Hell's abomination - boundless chains of woe
With mighty stride, the horsemen ride in a sable blackened glow
Into night - into fury
Horse of crimson she rides
Blinding light - kiss of fire
From the depths, arise
Wasteland of confusion - where nothing's as it seems
Beneath the skies, the daylight dies
Destroyer of all dreams
Bringer of misfortune - monarch's great abyss
And by his side - the queen of lies - unleashes fury's kiss
Into night - into fury
Horse of crimson she rides
Blinding light - kiss of fire
From the depths, arise
Feels like the sky is falling
My demons calling my name
From the other side
I'm being buried - feels like I'm buried, buried alive!
Bring down the hammer with furious anger
It´s me against the world
Bring down my fists with flaming malice
It´s me against the world
Into night - into fury
Horse of crimson she rides
Blinding light - kiss of fire
From the depths, arise
Charon
Through me you pass - just take my hand
The ferryman whispers my name
The course has been set - lord of the damned
To the banks, over river of pain
We rise and fall - with the tide
On through the gates, where shadows await
See the glimmer of gold in his eye
"The bridges have been burned - never to return"
Sail away - on the winds of Charon
Take me to the distant shore
Lead the way - on winds of Charon
By the Gods, I can't ignore
The sight of his face - shrouded in death's cold embrace
Through me you pass - to the lacrymose plains
Though my passage comes with a price
A sky without stars is all that remains
To the shores made of fire and ice
We rise and fall - with the tide
Just say the word - cause there's no return
To the coast where the true power lies
"The bridges have been burned - never to return"
Sail away - on the winds of Charon
Take me to the distant shore
Lead the way - on winds of Charon
By the Gods, I can't ignore
The sight of his face - shrouded in death's cold embrace
Hell And Back
I have led the lamb into the slaughter
Ice flowed through my veins
I was my own worst enemy, still hellish memories remain.
I have shown the serpent into the garden
And wore the Mark of Cain.
Take a look in these eyes, where the past evil lies –
And feel my pain.
Oh – the hell's hounds drawing near
…And my conscience isn’t clear
I’m the one who whispered the words to Judas,
I’m the hangman’s noose.
Though I try to repent, in a valiant attempt –
It’s no use
I’m the judge, the jury, the executioner
Oh, the things I’ve seen
With an eye for an eye, kill the man, kill the past, kill the dream.
Oh – the hell's hounds drawing near
…And my conscience isn’t clear
I’ve been to hell and back…
And I can’t justify believing the lie, I slowly fade to black
Learning to live and die – I’m learning to fly.
Under the moonlit glow – I just can’t let it go
Words spoke in vain, now fall like a silent tear.
As shades dance by candlelight – in the dead of night
And all of the things I yearn slowly disappear
And now there’s nothing here…
Riding the storm, heading for a fall
I curse you all – be damned.
Through the haze, the sword that cuts both ways
A line is drawn in the sand.
Ironbound – a will as cold as steel,
To conquer all and divide
Striking with an iron fist of will
I will not be denied.
On and on and on…No quarter asked, no quarter given.
On and on and on…Never forgotten or forgiven.
Thunders rise from the terror’s eyes
Scorched by a heart drenched in black.
No return, I will watch it burn
Now there’s no turning back.
On and on and on…No quarter asked, no quarter given.
On and on and on…Never forgotten or forgiven.
I’ve been to hell and back…
And I can’t justify believing the lie, I slowly fade to black
Learning to live and die – I’m learning to fly.
In My Darkest Hour
I’ve been betrayed
By the angel of death
And the serpent who stole her last breath.
Feeding the flame
Though I pray for the best,
I prepare for the worst, just the same.
Dominator – Subjugator
Locked in an apocalypse gaze
Desecrator – Devastator
Set my world ablaze
In my darkest hour – with “thy kingdom’s power”
Hear my song and hear my plea
Put the pieces back together – nothing lasts forever
May darkest hour – let it be…
Grant my request
Darksome master of pain
Incarnation of all that’s profane.
Without a prayer
Under six black wing’s flutter
And six mouths of screaming despair.
Born a Liar – Falsifier
Trapped in this damned infernal maze
Crucifier – born of fire
Set my world ablaze
In my darkest hour – with “thy kingdom’s power”
Hear my song and hear my plea
Put the pieces back together – nothing lasts forever
May darkest hour – let it be…
In my darkest hour – with “thy kingdom’s power”
Hear my song and hear my plea
Put the pieces back together – nothing lasts forever
May darkest hour – let it be…
Run With The Devil
I’m on the run, nowhere to turn, they’re on my heels
Lost in the maze, where do I go?
Am I insane, it’s just a game of life and death
Stay the course and ride the flow.
I cross the bridge, I’m at the gates
I’m out of breath, chasing the clock, I’m out of time.
I hear the dogs, I feel the claws rake down my back
There’s no escape, no peace of mind
Oh – Just hold on
Oh – Just hold on
I’m on my way to you…
Run with the devil – run for your life
The truth of the moment, it cuts like a knife
Chasing a shadow – still chasing a dream.
When it’s ‘do or die’, you know there’s no in between…
I see the fiends, they’re on the move, they strike with fear
Give them the slip, I duck the blade
I knuckle-down, I roll the dice, I dance with death
Lost in the realm of light and shade.
My path is weak, it falls away, I feel the heat
The fires of hell beneath me rise.
Caught in a trap, there’s no way out, walls closing in
Is this the hour of my demise?
Oh – Just hold on
Oh – Just hold on
I’m on my way to you…
Run with the devil – run for your life
The truth of the moment, it cuts like a knife
Chasing a shadow – still chasing a dream.
When it’s ‘do or die’, you know there’s no in between…
I’ve searched the depths of hell to find the key
I’ve wasted time – now time has wasted me…
Run with the devil – run for your life
The truth of the moment, it cuts like a knife
Chasing a shadow – still chasing a dream.
When it’s ‘do or die’, you know there’s no in between…
Swansong
I stand alone
As my world comes crashing down
Some things are never meant to be
Accept your fate cause there's no second-time around
"It´s not the stars or sky that shapes our destiny"
Just a fateful glance
Just a fleeting chance in the wind
Gone forevermore
Hear my song, carry on
Through the lost and lonely air
Still I sing, can it bring
All the things that I desire?
With you, I wouldn't change a thing
Just for you, I'd do most anything
But now you´re gone
And my swan song echoes on
I walk alone, like a stranger in this town
Is it best to fail or never try at all?
I face the shadows, as the sun is sinking down
"Some rise by sin - and some by virtue fall"
Just a fateful glance
Just a fleeting chance in the wind
Gone forevermore
Hear my song, carry on
Through the lost and lonely air
Still I sing, can it bring
All the things that I desire?
With you, I wouldn't change a thing
Just for you, I'd do most anything
But now you´re gone
And my swan song echoes on
Goddess of shadowy play
Whose boundless power, divides the night from the day
Plains of woe, eclipsed from all sight
And wrapped forever in the darkest depths of night
Hear my song, carry on
Through the lost and lonely air
Still I sing, can it bring
All the things that I desire?
With you, I wouldn't change a thing
Just for you, I'd do most anything
But now you´re gone
And my swan song echoes on
Legend
Steal away through the land of the dead –
Where angels fear to tread
Over mountains, the sky, and the sea.
Feel the light bleeding from a new moon –
Escape from the hands of doom
I never thought I could change what would be.
Break the chains of fear
I won’t shed another tear
The rise and fall
Although I fight like hell, there’s just no certainty.
My battlefield lay scarred with empty victories.
Running from the past, from a lifetime of lies.
But the legend never dies…
Here comes the horror, here comes the pain –
Flying too close to the flame
Into darkness, now falling from grace.
From the nine realms of woe, I arise –
Vindication in my eyes
Lines of tragedy carved deep on my face.
Break the chains of fear
Now it all seems crystal clear…
The rise and fall
Although I fight like hell, there’s just no certainty.
My battlefield lay scarred with empty victories.
Running from the past, from a lifetime of lies.
But the legend never dies…
The rise and fall
Although I fight like hell, there’s just no certainty.
My battlefield lay scarred with empty victories.
Running from the past, from a lifetime of lies.
But the legend never dies…
The legend never dies…
Iconoclast
Rise of the one -
The dark iconoclast
Forging a cult of fear,
With legions unsurpassed
Shouting the word -
With vicious tongues of fire
Born of illusion and deceit
Fiendish soul of a liar.
The chaos unseen rips
The midnight sky
Infernal machines arise
Flesh and steel collide
We are strong
We will stand and fight
We are strong
We will stand and fight
With rage we ride into the flames
Striking with spears of hate,
At the heart where evil reigns
Holding the line from the charge
Of armored steeds
Gather around this deadly ground,
Come watch the war god bleed.
The chaos unseen rips
The midnight sky
Infernal machines arise
Flesh and steel collide
We are strong
We will stand and fight
We are strong
We will stand and fight
Victory or death, only time will tell
Synthetic resurrection,
From the heart of hell
Slowly they fall, as we watch
The daylight die
We spit and curse this hallowed earth
With our final battle cry,
The chaos unseen rips
The midnight sky
Infernal machines arise -
Flesh and steel collide
We are strong
We will stand and fight
We are strong
We will stand and fight
The End Of Innocence
Bite your tongue
The blackened sun
Will curse the moon
Skies of fire
Nothing's worth a damn
Calculate
Anticipate
Your every move
Beware
The ruthless hearts of man
Feel my pain
My words are in vain
I believe it's the end of innocence
Don't look away
Oh, hear what I say
I believe it's the end of innocence
Cut and splice
a fierce device
Degenerate
Sons of light
Synthetic gods, our man
Crushed beneath
The dragon beast
Breathing hate
Your blood
Your blood is on their hands
Feel my pain
My words are in vain
I believe it's the end of innocence
Don't look away
Oh, hear what I say
I believe it's the end of innocence
The world is dying
The precious sands of time
Are running out
We are the fallen
Made obsolete
Methodically phased out
...Feel my pain
Feel my pain
My words are in vain
I believe it's the end of innocence
Don't look away
Oh, hear what I say
I believe it's the end of innocence
Dehumanized
Tap the vein - Inject my brain
And let the poison flow
Torn apart - You’re ripping out my heart
It's painless, let it go
Come on, hit the switch - You son of a bitch
I'm devoured, broke in two
You take control and resurrect my soul
Becoming something new...
What's done is done - I'm dead inside
I'm what you've all become - Mindless and mesmerized
Dehumanized
I'm dehumanized
Don't you realize - I'm Dehumanized
Oh, and victimized
You can't break me
You unmake me - Dehumanized
Ripped to shreds - the venom spreads
Release the system plague
Shed your skin - electrified within
Complete the final stage
I will break my shell and unleash hell
There's nothing you can do
Just a cut above - This sacred new blood
Becoming something new...
What's done is done - I'm dead inside
I'm what you've all become - Mindless and mesmerized
Dehumanized
I'm dehumanized
Don't you realize - I'm Dehumanized
Oh, and victimized
You can't break me
You unmake me - Dehumanized
Is this life worth the question why?
Or is this life just a lie?
'Cause my eyes are cold and numb
And I don't know what the hell I've become...
Dehumanized
I'm dehumanized
Don't you realize - we're all Dehumanized
Enslaved and victimized
You can't break us,
No, you can't unmake us
We have all become – Dehumanized
Bastards Of The Machine
You can be all you desire
An honest man - a vicious liar
Seek out the Light or seek the Dark
You can honor or desecrate
Sympathize or manipulate
Carved in your flesh - embrace the Mark
Enslaved and hypnotized -
Chained to artificial lives
You are the Bastards of the Machine
The Bastards of the Machine
Be a saint for those in need
Or spin them webs of lust and greed,
Yeah, you've restored my dying faith
With a kiss of death - a last farewell
Hand in hand, through the Gates of Hell
You'll pay the price for the choice you make
I see your demons rise -
Deep within your burning eyes
You are the Bastards of the Machine
The Bastards of the Machine
The Bastards of the Machine
The Bastards of the Machine
Heretic
The human infection
Soaring on winds of woe and pestilence
Remove imperfection -
Parasites with lives of little consequence,
Even though we know the sky is falling
Still we choose not to believe,
On your knees...
Heretic - devil in disguise
Never quit - tearing down the walls, brick by brick
Feeding on the lies - Heretic
Counterfeit's the kingdom you devise
The flesh breeds corruption -
Irradicate the insect prey, exterminate
Crawl with the Leeches - you cry
Shattered to pieces - you die
Here I stand - god of man - the Perfect Beast
Even though we know the sky is falling
Still we choose not to believe
On your knees...
Heretic - devil in disguise
Never quit - tearing down the walls, brick by brick
Feeding on the lies - Heretic
Counterfeit's the kingdom you devise
Oh, burn!
Watch me burn - Live and learn
As the night surrounds me
No escape, no where to hide
Feel the sting of severing
Become one with Darkness
No escape, I'm dead inside
Heretic - devil in disguise
Never quit - tearing down the walls
Brick by brick
Feeding on the lies - Heretic
Counterfeit's the kingdom you devise
Children Of A Faceless God
Screaming at the walls around me -
Broken and alone
Fighting with my inner demons is all I've ever known
All I am - I give to you
All my dreams and nightmares, too
Disconnected life of anguish -
The mirror fades to black
Feels like I'm sinking deep into illusion.
No one's staring back
Somewhere unseen - there's something between
Is it the truth or a lie...
Can't you see - You and me
We're Children of a Faceless God
Misery is our destiny
We're Children of a Faceless God
Just another faceless shadow - I'm desensitized
And I don't feel the pain, am I insane?
My nightmare's realized
Somewhere unseen - there's something between
Is it the truth or a lie...
Can't you see - You and me
We're Children of a Faceless God
Misery is our destiny
We're Children of a Faceless God
All I have - I give to you
All my dreams, my nightmares, too
Wretched promenade - watch the freak parade
Celebrate the suffering and affliction
Laugh at tragedy - worship sin with me
Let us share in selfish addiction
Spitting on the shrine - drink the poison wine
Leave a life in ruins - tattered and torn
Completely interfaced to a God without a Face
In his image of darkness...  I'm reborn
Can't you see - You and me
We're Children of a Faceless God
Misery is our destiny
We're Children of a Faceless God
When All Is Lost
I believe...  Nothing ever comes to light -
Chasing shadows in the night
In a starless sky and I wonder why
I believe... We will never find a way -
That darkness lights the day
We never question why, still I wonder why?
I close my eyes lost in a memory
Just like a candle in the wind
What could have been, with just one kiss goodbye
You spread your wings to fly
Far away, somehow, someday you will understand
I hope you'll understand... someday
Silent pictures speak like ghosts in the machine
Haunting my reflection in the frame
Chasing down the hopeful child inside of me
Where'd it all go wrong and who's to blame
We pass the time away
With empty lives, the laughter dies
Is this all we have to show?
Is this all they'll ever know?  Can they find their way?
What went wrong?  Where have all the heroes gone?
Trading futures for a song we gave away
Thinking only of myself, I forged ahead
No regrets, no apologies
Bitter tears reward the life that I have led
A world of lies brings me to my knees
I took the road with every twist and every turn
The words of wisdom is the lesson never learned
Lose your fear and free your soul or
The mysteries of life you'll truly never know
You’ll never know
Is this all we have to show?
Is this all they'll ever know?  Can they find their way?
What went wrong?  Where have all the heroes gone?
Trading futures for a song we gave away
Just gave it away…
I close my eyes, lost in that memory
Like a candle in the wind
What could have been, with just one kiss goodbye
You spread your wings to fly far away
I hope you'll understand one day
We pass the time away
With empty lives the laughter dies
And the colors fade – fade away
Is this all we have to show?
Is this all they'll ever know?  Can they find their way?
What went wrong?  Where have all the heroes gone?
Trading futures for a song we gave away
What went wrong?
Where have all our heroes gone?
Trade our future for a song,
We gave it all away...
Electric Messiah
You liberate me, separate and set me free
You release my spirit to the wind
For evermore your name will soar inside of me

Hail the Night - the Bringer of Light
My Electric Messiah

As one by one, all the kingdoms fall in line
Oh, so blind…

Light Up The Night
Have you lost all your senses?
Oh, why did you have to go tempting fate?
Blinded by your ambitions
Oh, why can't you see the chaos you create?
Oh, have we gone too far, too fast?
My dying eyes scream with pain
All my hopes and my dreams drown in flames
And all the lies shine so bright
All the souls of the world light up the night
You're a slave to desire
For lust of profit you consume my soul
Do you think you can make it stop?
Oh no - it's too late to turn, you've lost control.
Oh, have we gone too far, too fast?
My dying eyes scream with pain
All my hopes and my dreams drown in flames
And all the lies shine so bright
All the souls of the world light up the night
Pushing the boundaries
Reinvent a new reality
Changing evolution
Ignoring the past
As we realize our destructive destiny
Come on!
I want to see you drown in flames.
My dying eyes scream with pain
All my hopes and my dreams drown in flames
And all the lies shine so bright
All the souls of the world light up the night
The Lords Of Chaos
Forged in blood, carved in stone,
Right before your eyes, you’ve always known
See the truth inside yourself, see the world like no one else
Oh, if only you were king, you could change everything.
Can’t you see what they’re doing to you and me?
We rule, we fly
Above the lights of the neon sky
We fight, we cry
The Lords of Chaos will never die
All you see must be destroyed
Your destiny you can’t avoid
Show them all your demon sign
Tell them all to get in line
There’s no time to waste
Its poison but they can’t taste it.
Don’t you see what they’re doing to you and me?
We rule, we fly
Above the lights of the neon sky
We fight and we cry
The Lords of Chaos will never die
Will never die.
The quick and the dead
Moving fast they’re in your head
Infection spreads in the blood of the damned
The truth and the lies
It’s all the same, it’s just a game
You see, day and night you hold them in your hands, oh…
Oh, can’t you see what they’re doing to you and me?
We rule, we fly
Above the lights of the neon sky
We fight and we cry
The Lords of Chaos will never die
We rule, we fly
Above the lights of the neon sky, oh…
We fight, we cry
The Lords of Chaos will never ever die
Reign In Madness
Scorn the omen - architects of deceit
Pulverized within the jaws of defeat
Our ruin engineered, we’ve reached the gates of fear
Forging vengeance in the city of doom
Ripping death from sin’s unholy womb
The riders on the storm, cursed the day they’re born
We were warned...
Strike them down - strike with power
Kill them all from shore to shore
We destroy - we devour
We command the vicious dogs of war
Treads of iron crush the skulls of the damned
Stench of burning flesh covers the land
Rising from the screams - a godless war machine
Execution - fire scorches the sky
Crimson horsemen runs with genocide
As the seas turn red, We raise the living dead
Or so it's said...
Strike them down, strike with power
Kill them all from shore to shore
We destroy - we devour
We command the vicious dogs of war
Bow your heads and abandon hope
We’re the gods of pain
Raise your hands if you’ll join with us
And let the madness reign
Forsaken and forgotten
Condemned - hopeless and alone
The sickened and the rotten
Infect everything you’ve ever known
War hammer of disaster
Crushing every living head
Surrender to the masters
The brainwashed electric living dead
There’s no escaping
The more I learn, the less I know.
I must be crazy
I’m giving in, I’m letting go
If all the world’s a stage,
It’s just a masquerade of crazies
Hit the lights and start the show...
Oculus Ex Inferni
Set The World On Fire (The Lie Of Lies)
God-like perfection
reflect in these eyes
reaching for my place - With stars on high
Damn the betrayers
Through twilight, I fall
Headlong flaming - I curse you all
There's no turning back
falling deep into the sweet collapsing black
Fly with me - forever higher
And with these wings,
We'll Set the World on Fire
Fly with me - through scorching skies
You and I - The Lie of Lies
I'm the Master of Illusion
Minister of sin
Two - faced snake - wicked - shedding skin
I will forsake you
Destroy and unmake you
With all my might, I will take you down
There's no turning back
Falling deep into the sweet collapsing black
Fly with me - forever higher
And with these wings,
We'll Set the World on Fire
Fly with me - through scorching skies
You and I - The Lie of Lies
Don't leave me - you need me
only I know the way...
Domination
All along the waste and wild
legions of lost scream in pain
A million shattered destinies
all slowly drowning in tears of flame
Break the chains around your necks
lick your wounds you Dogs of War
Raise your banners ever high
and ravage the Babylon Whore
I, with darkest insurrection, victimize
Hail the horrors, all hail and sanctify
...my Domination
Rotting from the inside out
ripping away to the core
A million lies unite as one
slaughtering innocence for evermore
Sound the mighty drums of doom
march to this black heart of fate
Clawing, tearing, slashing deep
defiantly fighting our fate
I, with darkest insurrection, victimize
Hail the horrors, all hail and sanctify
...my Domination
Turn the waters red with rage
burn all the earth shore to shore
Open wide the Gates of Hell
defile the Babylon Whore
I, with darkest insurrection, victimize
Hail the horrors, all hail and sanctify
...my Domination
...my Domination
The Serpent's Kiss
Covenant of pure corruption
sink my teeth deep into you
Solemn oath of sheer destruction
Nightmare, through and through
In that hour - I'll devour
Hope is swallowed up in Pain
taste the venom - feel the power
coursing through my veins
I'm corruption
I'm destruction, through and through
Trust in me... for I will set you free
with a Serpent's Kiss
with a Serpent's Kiss
Be my lights and I won't stray - make me beg
make me pray
Tell me when to laugh or cry - when to live
and when to die
Forgotten and betrayed
Rotting and decayed
left to wither - without a voice
left to slither - without a choice
Crucifier - spitting fire
say your little empty prayers
This empire - growing higher
To this spite I swear
Sharp tongue severs - like a razor
swimming in a sea of rage
Vindicators - masqueraders
all the world's my stage
I devour
I empower - god of pain
Trust in me... for I will set you free
with a Serpent's Kiss
How could it come to this?
with a Serpent's Kiss
Paradise Lost
In the cold misty morning
gleaming rays awake the dawn
Here I stand - a stranger in this land
does your conscience betray you?
falling from grace -
feel the sun on my face
does desire still hold true?
Mystified by her beauty -
does the hunter pity his prey?
Under starless skies all
Love must die and fade away
Take my hand - divine or damned
Make a stand, seize the day
Yours or mine, damned of divine
Draw the line, come what may...
Looking down from ethereal skies
Silent crystalline tears I cry
For all must say their last goodbye -
to Paradise
My yearning is silenced by angelic skin of white
Love conquers all for heaven's fall
this faithful night.
Yours or mine - damned of divine
Draw the line - serpentine...
Love is a tragedy
all that I have, all that I'll ever need
is right here inside
Let the winds of freedom be my guide
Looking down from Ethereal Skies
Silent crystalline tears I cry
For all must say their last goodbye -
to Paradise
Looking down from Ethereal Skies
Silent crystalline tears I cry
For all must say their last goodbye -
to Paradise
Say goodbye, goodbye, hold on!
...so I've cheated and I've lied
been the victim of foolish pride
and I've begged and I've crawled
and I've battled and bled for it all
now I'll savor the downfall...
of Paradise
Looking down from Ethereal Skies
Silent crystalline tears I cry
For all will say their last goodbye
to Paradise
Eve Of Seduction
It's alright - no need to question
Taste the night - just close your eyes
it just takes one bite
All you need's in my possession
Just believe - come take my hand, tonight and
trust your dreams
I'm falling all to pieces, slowly losing control
Can it be true?
Why can't you see - I'm Burning for You
There's no disguising my desires - what can I do?
All you will know - give me your heart
give me your soul
I'll tear it apart, so long as you'll never let me go.
On your ear - a whisper, fallen
Show no fear - go spread your wings and fly
shed no tears
Pleasure's pain - I hear it calling
feed the flame - within becoming kin with the
Sons of Cain
I'm falling all to pieces, slowly losing control
Can it be true?
Why can't you see - I'm Burning for You
There's no disguising my desires - what can I do?
All you will know - give me your heart
give me your soul
I'll tear it apart, so long as you'll never let me go.
Can it be true?
Why can't you see - I'm Burning for You
There's no disguising my desires - what can I do?
All you will know - give me your heart
give me your soul
I'll tear it apart, so long as you'll never let me go.
The Walls Of Babylon
Down the plains - come Hell Riders
blood of ice and hissing breath
Consumed by this lust - into battle
staring down the Eyes of Death
Skies of Red - Winged Thunder Breathing
Lightning Fire - Invaders - Light slayers
Cut down the fiends and betrayers
Dark destroyers - can't avoid or deny us
War Hammer of the Gods
Bring down the Walls of Babylon
Legions of Lies- beating down the Lamb
Wings of War, they pulverize
Wrath is my name - feel the Hatred
hurling defiance toward the skies
Skies of Red -  Winged Thunder Breathing
Lightning Fire - flesh churning - blood burning
the gears of War, ever turning with conviction
Malediction is King
War Hammer of the Gods
Bring down the Walls of Babylon
So here I stand -  beyond Apocalypse
God of Pain - in lethal stealth
Casualty of Pride - I will never be denied
A Lord of War... at war with Myself
Skies of Red -  Winged Thunder Breathing
Lightning Fire - earth shaking - bones breaking
the Hand of Fate dominating
one by one the Stars are Falling
War Hammer of the Gods
Bring down the Walls of Babylon
Seven
Above all - high and mighty - will like a towering
steed - a Web of Conceit that I weave
More...wanting much more - grasping with
Envious Eyes - dark desires lead to words
that cut like knives
Frozen in your tracks... No remorse
Embrace the rack - Twisting down your spine
... 'till the End of Time
It's Fire and Ice - make the Sacrifice
No one there to catch you when you Fall
It's Shadow's and Sin - Enemies Within
You'll be fine, so cross the line and Damn it all
Slip into Shades of Nothing - yesterday's
promises die - More, taking more than I need to
bleed you dry
Cut your throat - Abandon all Hope 'blood-money
lusting' portrayal - Break the trust from dawn
to dusk bring down the curtains on you final
act of betrayal
Empty hands recoil... feel your Blood begin to boil
Tails and Fangs or Doom - violently consumed
It's Fire and Ice - make the Sacrifice
No one there to catch you when you Fall
It's Shadow's and Sin - Enemies Within
You'll be fine, so cross the line and Damn it all
Virtue or vice? Will you pay the price?
When there's no one to catch you when you fall
...so Damn you All...
Give me hot-blooded yearning - infect and pollute
all that's pure - more than my heart can endure
Vengeance and Fury - Screaming
and eye for an eye - lashing out in Anger
I curse the sky
Demon Song is sung - first your ear ... and then
your tongue - Wear this Mask of Fire - and burn
for all you're desired
It's Fire and Ice - make the Sacrifice
No one there to catch you when you Fall
It's Shadow's and Sin - Enemies Within
You'll be fine, so cross the line and Damn it all
The Sacrifice
Your eyes, singing to me sweet lullabies
while you lay there in submission
Forbidden desire
alone in the moonlight hearts afire -
burn away our inhibitions
When the stars lose their fire
And night steals the morning away
Forever and a day
I will stay - I will stay here with you my love
Sacrifice, a heartbeat away from paradise
All my reason's giving way to temptation
Fear and Shame - looking for someone else to blame
We're devoured by these foolish accusation
With every fleeting breath I take
Maybe our love was a mistake
Eternal life - I'd trade it for
One moment beside you...
When the stars lose their fire
And night steals the morning away
Forever and a day
When the stars lose their fire
And night taked the morning away
Forever and a day
I will stay - I will stay here with you my love
Revelation (Divus Pennae Ex Tragoedia)
Against the wall - they see you
nowhere to run, nowhere to hide
Heroic Mask - The cracks are showing
a Faceless God to shape the Perfect Lie
Wounds of Hate have pierced so deep
they never die - my revenge is bittersweet
Lost in the night wandering alone
Try as I might to escape the fight
It never lets me go - I've got to find a way
A way to Rise above it All
Savior or the Fool - the mystery
fades into the cruel shade of night
This broken disguise can not comprehend
what was, and will be.... until the very end
Wounds of hate have pierced so deep
they never die - my revenge is bittersweet
Lost in the night wandering alone
Try as I might to escape the fight
It never lets me go - I've got to find a way
A way to Rise above it All
...oh, where the North Wind sleeps -that is when
we'll meet again... oh, where the shadows creep
into Twilight, I'll descend
Good and Evil, it never ends
You're just a means to an end
Lost in the night wandering alone
Try as I might to escape the fight
It never lets me go - I've got to find a way
A way to Rise above it All
Lost in the night wandering alone
Try as I might to escape the fight
It never lets me go - I've got to find a way
A way to Rise above it All
