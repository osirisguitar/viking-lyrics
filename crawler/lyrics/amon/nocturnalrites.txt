Destiny Calls
Who holds the secret?
Who sets my destiny?
When will I find out?
What lies in the path for me?
Who bears this knowledge?
The secrets of all to be
Foretell my future
Is the answer inside to see?
So I stand up and shout at the world
For my questions to be
But the powers are out of my reach
So here I am, still right back from the start
Destiny's calling leaving my future to be
Destiny's calling, screaming in anger,
my thoughts are out of reach
I hold my soul inside of my hands
The future is my past
Who'll light my way now?
Now that I stand alone
My past still haunts me
My friend is my enemy
The Iron Force
Strike the anvil and forge the steel
See the iron glow like fire
Create our armour, provide us all
Give us the power to foresee our fate
Oh the journey might long and hard
Magical wonders will lead us there
And by the powers that we hold in hand
Forged steel in a time of war,
feel the rage and the strike of the Iron Force
Lay down your magic, lay down your arms
Bring us message of the fight we won
See us coming, through the fire
Stand united for the ones we lost
Brothers unite and fight for the justice
Honour for all and never give in
Fight till the end, protecting the crown
Honour for all, till we fall will fall 
And feel the rage and the strike of the iron sword
Ride On
Thundering down over valleys and hills
Onward they ride, always side by side 
The legend tells about the templars, 
The mighty men, who walk in the shadows
There's blood on their blades, swords made of steel
Guardians of man, always fight for the right
The legend speaks about their coming, 
The mighty men, they live on forevermore
See them ride, emerge out of the sun
They will vanish in haze
Hear them come, emerge out of dark
They will never give in
Ride on, through the winds of time
Ride on, through the night
Leaving their preys with a mark of the good
They hunt down in rage, veil them in death
In the name of the righteous, in justice
They will serve the gods
Call for the force, and shout out through the night
Seek and do what is right
See them come, emerge out of the dark
They will never give in
Free At Last
Hear the voices inside of our minds now
Their message is leading the way 
Into the abyss we fall, we're standing at the edge
We're the prisoners inside of our own dreams 
Where the masters are holding the keys
Battling to save our souls, will we ever be set free?
We'll be free at last, if we stand till the end
We'll be free at last, if we stand as one
While all we knew has come to end, we'll be free at last
They're holding our souls in control now
We're lost in this maze of our minds
Fighting for our survival, striking back with force
We're trapped inside of this nightmare
We sense the light up ahead
Out from the abyss we go, rise up from beyond
Hold On To The Flame
It's been told about the mighty land,
The sun is never setting from the sky
Gold is washed up on the shore, to a shifting sand
The dream about the day when I'll never die
Charging through the open sea, no signs to lead the way
Wind will shift and carry us at hand
We feel the walls are closing in
The tide will take a turn, will make us drift ashore
Keep on holding on, Keep on holding to the flame
And life will go on
Keep on holding on, Keep holding 
Life will still go on
Holding on to promises and what the legends say
We will see the shore of our land
Skyline meets an open bay, Illusions might betray
Onward to the land of mystery
Eternity Holds
Long ago in an ancient time
Might men would gather
To witness what the prophet would proclaim
He spoke of powers and endless might
The gift of a second sight
See all the secrets in the unknown
Ride the storm, ride to be
Infinity lies open to read
Eternity Holds
It would blacken the sun forever
Magic will prevail
It makes the sky burst into flames
Speak the words of the mystery
And the world will come to fall
It's their will, their time has come to stay
When Fire Comes To Ice
Long before time when darkness 
was ruling the world
And in the shelter of night when the wicked
would gather again so see through the eyes of
the future they put on the spell In turn to gain 
in the powers they wait for the sign
It's a wicked game that the bravest 
would dread to fight 
Only for one man that's sent to end raging madness
Oh... When fire comes to ice
Oh... When fire comes to ice, then you will burn
Chained by the powers of magic,
they're loosing control 
Stare through the eyes of the
death and speak the words
The Legend Lives On
"Look at me, I am a dying man. 
My son, I can no longer watch over you. 
All I know, I have passed onto you, 
as you will for others. 
It is my gift to you. Leave on your own, 
leave this all behind. 
You bear the powers of a second sight, 
you hold the courage to believe. 
No swords, no magic, no spell can touch what you own." 
Now you stand alone, I leave my throne for you
Seek and find the truth, my mission here is done
Set your aims up high, you bear the second sight
I now pass onto you the knowledge of the wise
You were the firstborn and chosen to be king
Lead your troops, and I'll be there
Your legend lives on
Your name is carved in stone
The story of the chosen one, one couraged to believe
It's the destiny of bringing it all home
Holds the sense of time to come
In my name, the legend lives on
My names says victory, so I ride ahead of all
My mission will not fail, for vengence is my thirst
Return with and filled with calm and glorois to be 
Now we stand as one and the legend will live on
On the winds rides the memory
Of your time long gone
The King's Command
A knight is sworn to valour
And his heart knows only only virtue
His blade defends the helpless
And his might upholds the weak
Loyal to his kingdom
When the word of war goes out
Born to serve the nobel
When Kings and Queens request
Mount horse and head away
Sharpened steel, crossing blades, 
Before fear, do your work 
The King's command 
His word will be the law that we command 
The King's command
Out into the battlefield
Whoose blood will stain the ground?
Courage and our bravery 
Protects the borderlines
Plunging our steel into the hearts of enemy May our troops be many, 
for the fight has just begun
Heed the command
Never surrender
Fight till the death
Never break the oath.
Unholy Powers
Long before the number is at hand
The conjuring will take it all again
The prophecy is telling us of wisadry and fear
It's time to seek and haunt the land
In darkness they will gather once again
The wisdom might conceal or gain
Unholy powers are taking control
When the spell of the night's setting in
Unholy powers, we're all cast aside
Cause the night of the witch never ends
In the time when darkness now ruled the world again
After all was done, and laid to waste
The conjuring will take its toll and start it all
Death will be the outcome in this spell
Stand tall fight the force, the night will come to fall
Stand tall fight them all, unholy powers are taking control
Glorius
My hands are tied here, in the darkness
I'll never find out what went wrong
I'm being punished, and sent to die
These cold and icy walls will end my life
In the dungeon where the holy rule
Can someone ever ease the cross I bear
And my death will be Glorius
When my mission is done
And my death will be glorious
My task is complete, my journey will come to end
Their fate control them, I'll never loose
Te chains will hold me, hold me to the ground
I hold the answer, inside my mind
But in this prison I'll see the end

NOCTURNAL RITES LYRICS
Sword Of Steel
Riding out in darkness 
Hoarding no fear 
Toward horizons 
Dyed in black 
We drew the circle once again 
Around the pentagram 
Our swords drip in crimson 
To conjure the one 
Sign of evil Rides us through 
We see the flames of hell arise 
As we open the gates 
Sword of stell must be held up high 
Somber shades of death we ride 
Sword of steel will laude the one 
Sword of steel will crack the sky 
For aye the one will rise in shadows 
He holds the key to infinity 
Open the gates, swing my sword up high 
Sword of steel alk in darkened vapour 
Clad in veils of night 
Unholy powers will rise again 
We complete the ceremony 
To hail-side by side
Skyline Flame
Lachrymose they saw him leaving 
Riding along the skyline flame 
His shreiks shall forever echo 
Over valleys and hills 
Mesmerized by the evil 
Let the imperial one rule 
Ornated in blood we stand 
And in his eyes shone victory 
In from the darkness he'll return 
To his fortress 
Standing here with pride 
The skyline flame 
Paralyzed by the dark one 
Riding along the skyline flame 
The one who leads us in darkness 
And takes us to the flaming depths 
We have seen the abyss 
We crave its infernal deep 
We light our candles 
And let them light the way
Black Death
The countess was laughing 
She looked out the plague from her throne 
By the gate in the darkness 
The crowd was screaming in pain 
Cursed of sickness by starving 
People dying slow 
They are burning their bodies, the victims 
The plague got in hold 
The plague is getting in its hold 
There is no way to escape 
The old man conquered her throne 
So it's been told 
A new day was rising 
The unknown came riding along 
An old man with power and strength 
To conquer the throne 
In shelter of darkness 
The people were standing strong 
By their leader the old man 
They are hunting the countess down
In A Time Of Blood And Fire
In a time of blood and fire 
Before the break of dawn 
Mighty swords were held to the sky 
In a land that rules by darkness 
Of evil and fire spawned 
Damnation now eclipsed the sun 
As black horsemen rode along with 
Death at their side 
So the scene of death rose the winds 
In black blood they shall baptise 
And under a black star the demon will rise 
In a time of blood and fire 
They rode across the lands 
In a time of blood and fire 
Under wings of yore they shelter 
A thousand years have passed now 
Oh, so grim and dark 
Now men must laude the demon's mark 
Servants of unholy powers 
In darkness must confide 
To the abyss in the darkness they descend
Dawnspell
The Spell of the dawn has been cast 
Like the storm rides the wind 
It clouds darkness and evil 
To come on strong again 
It follows the sign of the one 
The bringer of thunder and storm 
Voices of darkness now call out 
The one to ride again 
Riding out instorm under cover 
Look out for the dawn and its power 
The spell is cast as it rides the wind 
Standing tall holy defenders 
Come on strong before the dawn 
And the night will come and spell will 
Rise again 
The curse of the spell has brought fear 
To the people again 
They run from the curse for they dread 
The spell of dawn they've seen 
There is no way to run from the spell 
The bringer of thunder and storm 
Voices of darkness anew called out 
And the ones they rode again
Lay Of Ennui
Hear us prince of darkness 
Guide us to our dreams 
To hold the seven keys 
To rule the world beneath 
We crave the blackest love 
As we gaze on through the gate 
Now thy name we call out 
Give us lord of evil 
Thy touch shall atone 
Through the sea of flames 
The seven gates we see 
We await the black salvation 
We light the thirteen candles 
Now thy name we call out 
Lay of ennui king of the lore 
Lay of ennui hear our call 
Lay of ennui prince of the darkness 
Lay of ennui we abide 
Through the darkest night 
Guide us to our dreamsow in front of thee 
But you won't hear 
As the flames of evil arose 
We draw the sign in the blood 
Now thy name we call out
Winds Of Death
Through the winds of death we ride 
I swing my sword up high 
You'll taste my steel, I won't abide 
Cause you know you are gonna die 
Clad in leather and chains we slay 
We fight for king and land 
We'll burn your homes and bring you dismay 
With our vast swords in hand 
Glory, victory, forever hail 
Howl in mighty rage 
Clad the sky bleak 
Claw the hide of enemy 
Hail the winds of death 
We spread the ashes of your dead 
There is nothing left to save 
We sear the ground where they bled 
We pledge doom upon your grave 
Make them cry and bleed 
The storm shall howl and now descend 
Hordes of shade, they call, they heed 
They call, they heed
Rest In Peace
Called out to load the ships 
They are sailing at dawn 
With hundred men at their side 
Flames from a distance 
Lighting up the sky 
And the warriors will rise 
Armed with swords and arrows 
Battle begins 
They will fight for their pride 
The sound of steel echoes in the night 
The wind cries out loud 
Into the night they are calling 
To the ones dying brave 
May they now rest in peace 
Forever the battle is won 
Twenty of the men are 
Slowly going down 
But the treasures are found 
Back on the ship, the survivors 
Scream out - the battle is won 
The twenty men who couldn't 
Make it to share their victory 
May they now rest in peace 
On the dragonisle, they are buried 
Side by side 
Hail to their pride
Dragonisle
By the power of our father's rusty 
swords 
We are standing proud and strong 
Under banner and king our soil 
Drinks blood of the enemy 
From here we see through the raven's eyes 
We ride the winds of north 
And from cups of silver we drink from 
The dragon's blood 
Standing tall 
STAND TALL 
To fight them all 
FIGHT THEM ALL 
For Dragonisle 
Through the Seven winds of Wrath we 
Called 
Called up to the gods 
With steel at our sides we defend the 
dragonisle 
Baptised in the dragon's blood 
We hail our king with pride 
And in the fire, for aye one with the king

NOCTURNAL RITES LYRICS
Eyes Of The Dead
A mind of its own, spawn out of fire
The demon becomes a God
A child, two-faced and innocent
Transcending
Control, fragments of nothing
Enslaving, reversed humane
Empires made out of nothing but air
Creation fails
Hungry he laughs at us all
Sacred is noyhing no more
In the eyes of the dead, at the edge of the night
In an oath of blood we are sacred
In the eyes of the dead, still nothing revealed
The wounds they still bleed, and won't heal
Blood in the sands, slaves to the hunger
Heaven denies them all
A god, a dome for its pleasures and lust
Possession
The falls prophets of nothing
Promise but take it back
The one, the futile and venomous son
Will torture
Shadowland
What was the light that I saw before me
As I opened my eyes
Behold, the dream opens up
What's the thing that I feel inside me
I can tell what will come
What has becomes of us all
Rise, Shadowland
A world of ice
A destiny, the final key
The dream has come alive
Rise up again
Open, Shadowland
A dream to be, eternally
Open, Shadowland
What's the thing that has come to haunt me
The dream comes alive
Inside the gateway of time
At the dead lake of bitter waters
The future reveals
I see the end of the world
Invincible
Across the desert plains
They come as though invincible
Out of a fallen land they walk away
Over the shallow seas
With bleeding hands they carry on
Towards the distance in the open sea
New dawn raging
The whips and chains are one
Out of a land without a reign
They come as one, as one they go
Out of the wasteland
No one to fall, Invincible
They will return
Proclaim awakening
To hail a god perpetual
A war in heaven knows no victory
Revelation
Now the sky opens up before my eyes
The vision blinds me
On the bolts of fire cast upon the earth
Out, out of the void the riders come
Through hail and flashes
In the distance hear the seventh horn still sound
No one is innocent
No, I will return again
The sky divides in two
The final revelation
Out of the void, see the riders emerge
The prophec is true
The final revelation
Feel the fire, as it's cast upon the world
No ripples upon the sea of glass
The shrine is open
As I wait the final sacring of my soul
I, I open the scroll and know my fate
The peals of thunder
When I know the secret of the seven seals
Never Die
Hear the calling
From the shadows in the deep
Won't surrender
We are standing at the edge
They call for arms and we'll stand our ground
It's neverending
When the power comes alive
Never falling
The truth is in our hearts
Rise up and stare the beast in the eyes
Wandering souls, never betray
The last of our kind, our eyes are ablaze
We'll never die
NEVER DIE
We're masters of the earth, coming alive
We'll never die
NEVER DIE
We're masters of eternity, fighting a world to be
Another aeon
And the endless sands of time
Everflowing
We rise above them all
Witch how the world turns into our throne
Underworld
An entity, living inside me
Scraped away, the flesh from my bones
Come on in and feel on my hunger
Welcome to my underworld
Come on in and lust in the darkness
Grasp away the skin from my face
Be the mask, defer to the master
I feel the lesion tainting me
Will the faces reader
Will the mask reveal
Will I bleed in splendour
How this silence is killing me
(In this silent underworld)
Don't defy, the mind is the altar
Raped away, in pretends to be me
Hollow soul, the beacon is fading
Welcome to the sin divide
Desecrate, the memories will haunt me
I am God, the festering wound
Empty eyes, a stare that still beckons
I feel its will, it's tempting me
Save my soul, give me peace
Let me through this hole, I'm dying
My soul is gone, you're killing me
Vengeance
Into the void, an image of nothing is fading
The venomous grey, dissolves into pieces of me
The carrion calls, entices the pest, they're falling
The Charon he waits
But no one can see the flames at sea
I'll have my vengeance
My kingdom come
I speak in silence
Last mind astray, lead me the way
Flames over ice, the visions are false
Wiat for my vengeance
See how it dies, outside the walls
The memory purged from my eyes
My vengeance calls
Aeons ignite, inflicting the visions forsaken
Begotten in sin
The womb holds the souls that will be
The ravenous hole, swallows the dirt it has taken
Even in death, a dead man is never free
Faceless God
A darkened room, a blackened hole
A septic grain turns the flesh into sand
The night is slain, the light is gone
I feel, how the vision fails me
Let them bleed, then suck them dry
A severed dream turns will to submission
This dying world, will bring rebirth
They kill, they kill for pleasure
The pathway is open
A choice must be made
I'm not afraid
Call out my name
Faceless god
A soul for a crown
His eyes are the color of blood
A life for a throne
Faceless God
Rejoice in sin, come on in
Repent no more but the scarring remains
Poisoned sheep, the flock has died
I know, how their blood still stains me
A prophecy, it comes to life
The curtain falls and out comes the truth
Whole death awaits, the memory comes
I know how the vision failed me
Birth Of Chaos
Another genocide, a masterplan foresaw the fall
A resurrection reversed
There's a brave new world, a soulless sphere that penetrates
It's the seal to our fate
Your gods have failed
Our will be done
The fiery chains that held but cut the fatal thread at last
Condemned eternities pass
Another motor spins, machinery of hate begins
And still crumbles and grinds
Black souls that seem unreal
Cold empty hearts
The formless hollow shells of man
Time, times of evil
The birth of chaos, regain of the earth
Time, times of evil
The birth of chaos reborn
The endless pain begins and torture breeds the suffering
Another destiny fades
A second sacrifice, a last revenge of human kind
Enslave the last one alive
Strapped to the offering god
The slaves of the earth
A blank stare is all that remains
Witness their birth
The Watcher
Inside the earth, they scheme for the slaughter
A part of the masterplan
Forbidden to be, for no one to see
Onnocence for pain, they twist in pleasure
Spawn from a life of gods
The watcher is all, destruction befall
The final embrace
A silent scream
Eternal debase, deceive or prevail
We rot to the core, the final ambition
The hunger begins to grow
Oblivious one, the fall has begun
The final embrace
A silent scream
The presence evolves, the colony grows
Fates are falling, names in stone
Final calling, the watcher of the fall
Fates are falling, rise or fall
Final calling, the watcher in us all
New World Messiah
Alone in a world of silence, I'm crawling in you
I won't ever betray your trust, feel me - I subdue
Trust you seek, and you'll find messiah
Take the stone 'round your neck away
Don't you ever display my fear
I'm yours - so come what may
Oh, and I opened the door
The cold's forevermore
So don't you see, you are your own enemy
So I'll fight, stand or fall
Choose my fate, feel how it's calling to us all
Stand or fall, the new world messiah
And the dawn of man
There are times when beckons to me,
Grips my throat and just pulls me in
Here I am but a shadow's worth, to wash away my sins
Against The World
They taught him right and waht to believe
How to live by the rules
They all restrained his hungry heart
With time he would conceive
Walked the path of a righteous man
Taught him how to belong
A winding road, and now it seems
No, the world is on my shoulders
I'm the one against the world
The one they lead astray
But I'll know till my dying day
I'm the only one against the world
Never stray from our way of life
Vent your anger within
Betrayal, it makes a bitter man
The truth cuts like knives
Now look at him and what he's become
He still kneels for them all
A broken pawn, about to fall
There he stands alone again
While his world becomes unreal
Forever astray
Avalon
In the void, long before time, the entity broke into five
The elements of life once came alive
Genesis, womb of the world, god of time
Bringer of all
Spring out of the dark, behold the light
Stand up in a land of flames
Gods at war, battle forevermore
Rise, Avalon
From the veil of mystery
The birth of time will soon begin
For all to see
Rise, Avalon
While tomorrow fades away
Welcome to the promised land
As all towers fall
Brave New World rise to the sky
The wonders of man crumble and fall
Man appointing Gods, unfold our fear
Awakening
I'll end my journey here
Because time and tide it waits for no man
There's something strange in me
I see the things that should not be
It's all a mindless game
Trapped inside the walls I built
Try to pull them down
But something stops me
Then the feeling comes alive
I can't hold it any more
Enemy...  Is it you
End of the line, walking alone
In this world of my own
Demons of guilt, battle to win
This is my awakening
There's no turning back
There's nothing to awaken me
Insanity my friend
I can feel your gripping hand
To roam the earth alive
But feel as if you're dead and dreaming
Try to break away, but nothing helps me
Egyptica
How many miles of endless sand
Must we drag your stones into this wasteland?
How many years in endless pain
Must we toil under your reign?
Just like in Babylon, no glory lasts forever
The icon is not, what it seems to be
No more slavery, no you're not heaven sent
Nothing stands alone, feel the endless pain
In Egyptica
Here we raise your tower high
Still an infant, but divine in our eyes
After years still flesh and blood
They said he would become a god
Break Away
Don't ever run, and live a lie
Rise above it all
Spread your wings to fly
Don't ever climb, the ship of fools
Sailing on and on
Face the truth
Hear the cry, destiny calling you again
Point the way, allow you to fly away
Following the silent voice within
Break away, rise anew
By leaving the memory behind you
Break away, carry on
Only the strong will live on
Your darkest hour, the final day
Looks you in the eye
Turn and walk away
Blackened soul, a heart of stone
Clown behind the mask
Let it out
End Of Days
Have you seen the fall of the world
How blood stains the ground at our feet
Mankind kills in the name of God
Holy vengeance, lies, and deceit
Have you seen the fall of man
How wounded he crawls through the mud
Dust and bones still cover the soil
While we measure our wages in blood
We've lost the our way, the end of the rope
Our final day
We'll never learn, bridges still burn
The end of days, now feel how we lost our way
Forgive the sins of those before
And turn the lies away
With eyes ablaze, no witness our end of days
A fading world for all to see, unfold the final decree
Dreams are spun in ivory towers
And fear is the game we learn
See the world, its barren soil
The shackles that hold us will burn
It feels like we fade away
The world is dark and burning
We know, it's coming near
This is the end of days
The Flame Will Never Die
The painting is fading now
The color's wearing thin
Her eyes in the broken glass
A stare that chills within
She cries only crimson tears
The eyes are burning with fire
Once beleived, made her strong
Once deceived made her wrong
Sorrow and pain
Closed her eyes to see through the unknown
Nothing's in vain, 'cuz the flame
The flame will ever die
The lines in her ashen face
Reveal a heart torn asunder
Twisted ones,bring the pain
Throw your first stone again
One Nation
The world was growing colder
They watched from far away
How man was weakened still
In his final day
How fear became his shadow
The feeble lead the blind
Another hell begins
You're next in line
From here we see forever, this place is ours you know
Our time is drawing near
One nation, one world
And forevermore, into an everlasting war
One nation, one world
And we heard the call, the future lies within our hands
Another shiny empire
Of evil come divine
Built your house on sand, it's over now
Time has come at last
Killing fields, gone at last and forevermore
Nightmare
To wake and wipe the sweat away
Like so many times before
Pray to see the light of day
There's something wicked in us all
We meet inside our dreams
When awake we can't recall
No sleep till dawn
To wander endlessly, set us free
Twilight, dream time defines our glory
In silence we conquer it all
Midnight, dream time conceals the story
We're alive in a nightmare
His idle hands, when aware
We all chant the rhyme in fear
Speak the killing words again
Dream maker. sing your little tune
Make us dance to what you play
Dream time is coming soon
Another Storm
I'ts getting hard to breathe, with a devil on my back
I''m tired, lost and confused
It feels like all is gone, I'm brought down to my knees
You pull me away without warning
My eyes are furious
But nothing is ever what it seems
Another storm is over
Make me see, or leave me be
Another storm is over
They're carving my name in stone
As I walk out into the storm
My mind's at war again, I'm waiting for the end
Tying to break out of here
It feels like all is lost, nothing to attain
It's always trying to drain me
Save Us
Here we are, a dying breed for ever more
Will we ever see the day?
Cast away, thrown into to the underworld
It's time to rise up from the dark and see the light
Save us, Save us
From this pain and misery, is this our destiny?
Save us, Save us
Chaos and despair, get us out of here
Silently, we close our eyes and meet again
Inside this prison full of souls
Wide awake, no one keeps this flame alive
We know we're trapped inside this hell forever more
Save us, Save us
From this pain and misery, is this our destiny?
Save us, Save us
Chaos and despair, get us out of here
Is there a light ahead, leading out here
Will we ever see the day?
It's coming closer now, the light begins to shift
Is this real or is it dream
Afterlife
I am the vengeance, a link between the worlds
Souring in legions, controller of all
I am the substance of the chaos
There's one dominion, an evil and divine
Spawn the inferno, oblivion calls
Don't look for sanctuary coming
The end is calling
Deceive and destroy
Afterlife - revelations unveil
A blackness remains, the end of the line
Ashes of man, eye of the one divine
The blackness ascends, powers untold
The Afterlife
The heart of chaos, will manifest again
The seed of the serpent, the dagger of doom
So even death can die in deadland
The phantom's aeon
Dream is denied
Afterlife - revelations revive
Wake Up Dead
Ride, hell's in fury, an evil in believe
Wrath upon the dead and dreaming
Lie, sins subliminal, I twist in harmony
Blood upon my darkest day
Slit my wrist and watch me bleed
Tighten the noose around my neck
Fear the evil, turn the lights
Wake up dead
I'm falling
I can hear it whisper as I desecrate myself
Wake up dead
It's calling
Wake up dead - alive
Die, life's expendable, taking my last breath
Waiting for my death I'm grieving
Why, in the darkest hours, I can hear my call
Hell for now and evermore
The sins will not justify, the blood on my hands
I'm twisting the knife
Reality is no more, I'm waking up dead and alive
The Sinner's Cross
Disengage your fear
and see the devil in the eye
Rearrange the truth
and be a believer to the lie
Is there a way to find,
peace of mind in the life you life
Search the inner soul
And you'll find the rainbow's end again
Far away, far from here
Cross the river, on a shore of another time
Far away, far from here
Cross the river on the other side
There it lies, far away
Seek to find your remedy
Your life is on the wire
Living on the disbelief
Salvation is the crime
Hell And Back
Look the beast in the eye, set it free
The animal will be unchained
See deep within, and you'll find what you seek
The powers will lie there unbound
The eye of the mind unfolds the unreal
Open the doors that where closed
Broken the seal to a new world within
Stand in the gateway to hell
Walk through the fire, let no one stand in your way
The unknown waits in the darkness alone
I am falling fast
I'm right in the final hour
Future turns to past
Been sent to hell and back
Nailed to a cross and I spit in disgust
No way that I'll follow the blind
Broken down the shackles that fettered my mind
The devil laughs by my side
Look in my eyes, and see what I've become
Come hell, come fire, I'm not afraid - perpetual at last
The Sign
Hear the cry from the underworld,
to pull you under
It's the enemy, the journey ends here
Light the path throughout the night,
it's getting close
Sanctuary in a hollow void
See a sign appear in the dark
Your sould will perish in flames
The Sign of the two turns to one
No savior uo high
The promised euphoria's gone
So hell is life and death
Fell the breath inside your minde,
it prevades your soul
Hear the voices cry, through the never
Your eyes turn inside out you're all alone now
Feel your heart explode, piece by piece
Pain, suffering just do it,
death is the blessing you seek
Your soul will be free,
Life is an endless torture,
for the mindless and weak
You're killing yourself
The Devil's Child
Born into sin,
a lust for the evil
Betrayed and deceived,
benn giving his number
Serpent of death, child of the darkness
A servant to torture, a slave to power
Twisting his mind, the ways of the wicked
There's no turning back
Ten thousand eyes, hiding the glory
Who's the chosen one?
Who could have known, death ws a blessing
It's the Devil's Child
The power he holds, witness the progress
His senses unfold the choice has been made
Eyes lit with fire, a snake in disguise
Collector of souls, the work must go on
Genetic Distortion Sequnce
Initiate gentice distortion sequence
Commence involuntary human breakdown
Watch the reconstruction
Beginning of the end
THe world is black and burning - Man has failed
Watch the second coming
A season of decay
World elimination - Activate
Another poor example
Can we survive?
Create the perfect sample of man
Evaluate - Eliminate
Eliminate the world
Genetic evolution
Composite of a man
Obliterate the defects - Mass -produced
Commencing the distortion
Decoding what remains
Redemption and illusion - Enervate
Sacrifice
Trapped in a world, where nothing is real
Lost in the fires of hell
Possessed I obey, in shadows I kneel
A sacrament, venom released
I hear'em calling, gripping for my soul
Schizophrenia, the eyes of the death unfold
Tormented mind, soul of black
Lock up in chains forever
Petrified heart eases the pain
I'll be my sacrifice
Shattering world, I will not betray
Rigid I await my command
The whisper is near it's leading the way
Death - the final demand
Turned around for another side of life
Temple Of The Dead
A dynasty falls, another reborn
The Pharaoh's legacy, carved into stone
IN scriptures of Re, the God of the Nile
Tell how to bury the chosen
Open the temple
Entomb the soul of the king
As the gate opened up,
and we saw the temple inside
Heard the calling from beyond,
in the temple of the dead
The new king is born, gets the white crown
Reigning in slavery, cult of the damned
The people rebel, dethroning the King
Comes withour warning, a shadow
Break the seal
Awake the soul Re
A prophecy
Then the dead arise, the dead shall arise
Hellenium
See them as they come, from blackened sun
Riding'cross the sky
Fear you'll be the one, hunted on the run
A refugee in mind
Dream that this blessing
Will lead you into the light
Blessed by the devil's kiss
Revealing the entrance to hell of night
Hell of night
Stare into the dark, don't look upon the face
Hiding in the night
Degenerated soul, fear it's your disgrace
Lost inside yourself
Okahoo
In the fire
Where the fallen await
Blinded to all of its glory
See the fear, in the eyes of the dead
The circle's to close once again
Close you eyes for a dying world
Death's command won't betray
Hell, calls
A cry from the new world
The dream lasts forever
Man, falls
Into the unknown
The new generation
Hear the silence, the process of death
The mind is an opening grave
No denial, the blood turns to black
No giving in to repent
Close you eyes for a dying world
Death's command won't betray
Mind torture, flames burst
Cast into the fire
Act of death, stop breathing
Machines will take control
Close you eyes for a dying world
Death's command won't betray
A Heart As Black As Coal
Before We Waste Away
Welcome to the new age
Where our views are warped and bent in shape
To fit the mold, the flavor of the day
All the numb and the pacified
It's a new world the stage is yours tonight
Sign up at the dotted line
Oh... come and join the ride
Can't someone save us
We just waste away
This is the new world
It's our darkest day
We keep on building fences
When freedom's up for sale
Can't someone save us
We just waste away
Look at all the righteous
Standing tall upon their own empires
The two-faced ones so good at faking smiles
Take a look at the games we play
Another headline all the world's stage
One more to fuel the hate
Oh... It's like we waste away
Can't someone save us
We just waste away
This is the new world
It's our darkest day
We keep on building fences
When freedom's up for sale
Can't someone save us
We just waste away
Can't someone save us
We just waste away
This is the new world
It's our darkest day
We keep on building fences
When freedom's up for sale
Can't someone save us
We just waste away
Just waste away
The Poisonous Seed
Repent My Sins
What's Killing Me
A Song For You
The Ghost Inside Me
Nothing Can Break Me
Flames
Welcome To The End

NOCTURNAL RITES LYRICS
Ring Of Steel
The queen sent out a message,
she heard about the ring 
With powers that no man,
that no man would dare to face
The warrior headed north,
riding through the night alone
Searching night and day for the
secret of the ring
The secret of the legend
lives forever 
The legend brought the queen together 
In from the darkness the warrior returned
and the ring that he held in his hand,
had the powers
To freeze the world, 
while the queen would bring madness
It's the ring of steel
A new day is rising,
the queen is laughing still
The ring that she wears
it's the evil itself
The secret of the legend lives forever
The legend brought the queen together
In from the darkness the warrior returned
and the ring that he held in his hand, had the powers
To freeze the world, 
while the queen would bring madness
It's the ring of steel
The ring was founded again
by the rightful owners strong demand
The queen is laughing still out of control
Dark Secret
The sun fades away as a distant flame
against the sky
Beyond the clouds lies
the undiscovered truth
A realm still not known to man
and the powers it possesses
Now the time is soon at hand so beware
Destined to doom by a force of the unknown
the answer still not far away
You all may wonder what lies beyond
Passing away through the eye of the storm
Sealed up inside so untouched, so secured
In The eye of the strm lies the seceret alone
In dark deep inside, a power so strong
The sky starts dividing,
and sends its wrath down to earth
The fallen ones emerge out of the mist
With powers never seen before,
and the secret it withholds
Another victim of the secret
had come forth
Destined to doom by...
Through the eye of the storm ...
Test Of Time
Standing lost at a crossroad
Life is lying in my hands
Faith is calling above us
And who can tell when the world will end
Time will choose only one man
Only one must grow old
We can both see it coming
And we know, it's been told
Passing through centuries
My mind growing weaker
Whose fate will be sealed
The gift of growing old
Only the strongest one
Will make it to the end
The final gathering is at hand
The time has come, there will be one
To stand the trial and the test of time
Another lifetime is on the other side
We're the last ones standing
Only one must fall
By the sword it settles
And we know it's been told
As the sreel rings through the night
I strike the deadly wound
We both see it's coming
And I know I'm the chosen one
Lost In Time
I'm waking up all alone
Not knowing where I am
Is this a dream or is this time for real
Will I forget about the past
Or will I end this way
If this is the way, how will I find it
Give me a sign I'll carry on
Still lost in time 
Forever
Forever lost in time
Standing here in a world so cold
This silence makes me mad
I wander endless miles to find the truth
My future lies ahead
I got this second chance
The Vision
Look through the darkness the vision of life
then tell me what do you see.
A dream you believe is a life you can't see
something existis but can never be.
You will wake up but not from a dream
when you wake up it will be for real
The feeling is real and so is the pain
Wherever you go it'll be the same
You cant believe you're trapped inside.
this can't be real, wake up in time
before it's too late, beforeyou've crossed the line
Don't overlook the eye of your mind 
when the eye of that vision is a piece of another time.
Forever beware of what you dream
The vision is so closed behind.
The vision you saw the eye of your mind
a dark side of you never meant to be.
The reason of being inside of this dream
something you never tought you would see.
The fury of madness the power of dreams
You could be safe so let visions be
You hold the secret the vision inside
Keep the knowledge and seal it inside
Warrior's Return
Riding out in the storm
Yet the night seemed so calm
We were hundreds of men
Side by side
Still the winds blowing strong
But sheltered by faith, we rode on,
on and on
Through the mist, we went on
With steel at our sides
We would make it to the end
Side by side.
Trough the rain and the mist
Approching our goal, we would
never, never surrender.
We're standing strong
There's a war left to fight
Beware for the warriors return
With swords held up high
There's blood left to spill
Prepare for the warriors return
We could fight 'till the end
Complete the quest
'Til the victors are standing alone.
By the strike of our blades
Men would fall at our feet
We've completed the quest
once again.
We're coming home
now the battle is won
Honor for the warriors return.
Pride for the ones who died for the cause
Glory for the warriors return.
Fill the cups up with wine
Uniting our force
And cheer for the battle we've won
and pride in our hearts
We will never surrender
Change The World
The stillnest of the night is here 
Our brothers of the world are standing alone
To take a stand when time has come
We'll lead the revolution through the streets
The time is now to fight the world
Join our hearts in unity now brothers of all
Stand together and our voices will be heard
When all is lost and nothing is gained.
Then I will change the world
When all is done we'll stand as one
We won, our trail through life is done
We'll lead the revolution through the streets
The time is now to fight the world
Join our hearts in unity now brothers of all
Stand together and our voices will be heard
When all is lost and nothing is gained.
Then I will change the world
Pentagram
They set sails towards the sea
Only brave men with hearts of steel.
To embark upon the journey
And bring the treasure back.
They will head the old man's words
As he wrote so long ago
"Go and find the treasure
and live for evermore."
For thousand days they sailed
Towards a distant world.
Reaching to where heaven ends
Beyond the stars- to find the pentagram.
Now the skys fades to black
Strong winds tear the sails apart.
Above them roaring thunder
That echos in the night.
Mighty waves cast the ship aside
One hundred men go down.
Everyone but one man
That lived on to be free.
Long ago they sailed away
To a land beyond the stars.
One man brought the fortune home
And lived for evermore.
Eye Of The Demon
Beyond the valley lies a neverending force,
the strongest of powers ever known.
For a thousand ages they tried to get hold
of the power that lies out of reach.
No swords of magic, no powers of man
could ever break the seal of fate.
Look within yourself to find the true meaning
The end is closer than you know.
Break the silence of the storms.
Find the keys to the seventh winds.
Beyond this world lies a secret,
men would die to uncover.
But within is where we learn how to see,
where the journey begins.
Eye of the demon.
Open the eye into a neverending world
to live the dream you never knew
Fill your heart with strenght from the mind
Rise to live and never die.
End Of The World
The propheey tells of the powers so strong
There's no chance to be saved from the fate
There's no future for life, but the fire still burns
And the world ill soon reach its end.
All eyes of this world shall witness
The coming of the propheey.
Stand the chance, stand in faith.
It's the end, it's the end of the world
Heaven's falling down
The sun will turn black and then heaven shall fall
An earthquake is shaking the ground.
Open the seals and the secret unfolds
As we witness the fall of the earth
The sun loosing shape and heaven starts falling.
There's no chance to be saved from this fate.
The Curse
There's something in the dark
There's something is us all
The fear of dying has no end
the fire in our eyes
Will keep our faith alive
The burning flame will last forever
In our dreams the curse lives on and on
'Till light breaks the spell
The memory still haunts us down
All because of the curse
There's something we all know
In the past down below
That haunts our minds and dreams together
We're searching for the way
Below the unknown truth
The burning flame will last forever 
In our dreams the curse lives on and on
'Till light breaks the spell
The memory still haunts us down
All because of the curse
Burn In Hell
I'm a loser, it's tearing me apart
But I've got some news,
I'm not going down this time
Wake up your fools 
'cause you don't stand a chance
If I stand or fall,
I'll rise no matter what
Doomsday's bells (Doomsday's bells)
Hear the prophe's word
You're a liar and a thief,
by my hands I'll make you kneel
Burn in hell, Burn in hell
By my hands I'll make you kneel
Choke on the pieces of your past
Nowhere to run, the luck will take it's turn
Doomsday's bells (Doomsday's bells)
Hear the prophe's word
You're a liar and a thief,
by my hands I'll make you kneel
Burn in hell, Burn in hell
By my rage and fury fall
Wake up, you fools don't stand a chance
If I should fall I'll rise again.

NOCTURNAL RITES LYRICS
Fools Never Die
Trading their lies on the TV-screen
Telling us all what to be
Act like they're gods, egos inflated
Can't believe you'd fail to see
Other lives on the great divide
And hungry you swallow their scheme
Small-minded fools, all so conceited
Don't you know that they're never quite they seem
As weird as if a dream
Another fool, one more crossing the line
Won't believe, a mad man leads the blind
So follow your heart and hear them cry
Because fools never die
Crawl on your knees for your world to grow.
A round of applause and you go
In with the freaks, swallow our poison
Never thought you'd stoop this low
Never Trust
I tried to leave you
But there you are
Feeding me your point of view
So why'd you come here
To smother me
When I can't make you disappear
And you, will never betray me anymore
It's true they say, that time will tell, what parts we play
Never trust a stranger
No more trials and endless wars
Never trust a stranger
Before your final day,
Then come what may
We did it your way
Now look at me
Then tell me what you really see
I know it kills you
And I don't care
I'd like to drag you down here too
Still Alive
Like a thunder storm it's breaking out
Won't take another blow, and,
I'll let you know
I'll never kneel or falter
'cause you are not the only
I'm not crawling back again
I'm still alive
Though I'm old, trite and weary
And I know I'm alive enough
To stand my ground
So there is nothing to revive -
I'm still alive
I tried to wash away those filthy lies
Betrayed and lead astray,
I just walked away
In my darkest hour
I still hear you breathing
Well, you won't get the best of me
Something Undefined
Here we are, travelled on forever
Thought we had it all, never got that far
Carry on: tell us what we're fighting for
Free us from what we are
Why is nothing meant to last?
Forever and ever
Trying to leave it all behind
We're all afraid to walk away
Forever, wherever
Trying to find our peace of mind
Fighting for something undefined
Hollow one, on the edge of never
Thought you had it all, in the barrel of a gun
Point the way: shoot those blanks into the dark
Tell us we're moving on
In the future or the past?
Leave it all behind...
Our Wasted Days
Man is but a liar
A coward and a thief
The things that we aspire
And hide behind belief
We claim it's for the maker
And do his righteous deeds
It's time for all us fakers
To solely name it greed
We all know it's someone
That pulls our weight
One fate, the final hour
Brave new world, depraved new ways
While the piper plays on through our wasted days
Brave new world, still unheard
Crying out for more, I am god
Welcome age of reason
Teach us to conform
Wise men call it treason
Straying from the norm
So buy that costly promise
Shove it down your throat
Choke up on their slander
Buy that precious vote
As the clock keeps turning
We know it's over now
The walls are closing in
Cuts Like A Knife
There it comes the ship of nails
Down the river it's setting sails
Now I see why they're all so pale
(I carry the dead and the bizarre, I am Naglfar)
What would you recommend?
Could you help me to comprehend?
Will this mean I'm forever condemned?
(Well, that's what you get for killing your best friend)
Don't get me wrong
I killed him all right,
But he stabbed me first
I'm not the one, but that's not the worst...
It cuts like a knife
(An eye for an eye)
It cuts like a knife
(I've come for your life)
I don't know, what to do
Can't you see what I'm going through?
Here I am, if I only knew
(I'm back to reign again)
End Of Our Rope
I've been too blind to see
It's not the world I know
You promised me
But sometimes we hide
Who we really are
You say you're not sorry for all that you did,
For going too far
While we are trying harder,
Falling deeper
But we are only what we are
Nothing can help us from falling
Hoping we'd come to the fore
I'm not afraid, and I won't be
Your slave anymore
No one can stop us from trying
Hoping we'd settle the score
We're at the end of our rope
At the end of our rope
What's left to know on the other side?
Maybe it's time I rest my troubled mind
Well sometimes we fight
What will never die
Seems like we know that we're trying
Too hard, it's sucking us dry
Never Ending
Follow the light, do as they say
It's never ending
Unlock the beast you keep inside you
Swallow your breath, wait for the call
You'll walk the thin line
Welcome to our destiny
Do like the others
You won't be afraid
Fall to the ground and pray again
Never ending
They're all waiting for the call
One step away from it all
Never ending
Always trying, never finding
Shelter from the storm
Wake up the world, all playing god
Won't feel so hollow
The silent voice is there to guide you
Slipping away? Reach out your hand
They'll give you shelter
Welcome to eternity
One By One
Ease the pain, no more dying
It's the answer that takes you higher
Just find your voice, that inner fire
Break the rules, and, point that finger
They're all trying to pull you down
Just walk up straight and let them know
You lost your faith
Never turn and walk away
Just spit back in their face
Forget those games they play
We're hungry
Until we come undone
We'll travel down
Those empty highways
There's no way
Before it all begun
We're falling one by one
One by one
No more fear, no more hunger
Let them know that it's all in vain
Now who are they to tell you
What to think and say?
Deliverance
It's like you said,
The world is growing colder
It's in our eyes, we know
That it's dying
No return, the weight is on
Our shoulders
So who do we turn to?
Where do we go now?
Their empty hearts,
Two faced and brazen
They turned their backs and tried to,
See it through
We know they'd all agree,
Tomorrow's a memory
And it's all because of you
We are calling for deliverance
Because we know it's over soon
We are calling for deliverance
And we know, yes we know that we all
Wait for the call
It's like they knew,
The world was going under
Here we are, left, torn asunder
Now that all is lost,
No one would disagree
That it's all because of you
Fade Away
Tell me who would not be weary
When hours turn to days
And all we are, just rats within a maze
So who justified the hero?
That broke out from this cage
Spoke to the madness, then left and burned the stage
Nothing can save us
We're fading away
No one can help us
Fade Away we'll never be the same
Playing this foolish game
We're destined to fade away
There's nothing to reclaim
Playing this headless game
That's why we all fade away
When the hourglass is broken
And all is plain to see
That is when we're asking to be free
But It's all a grand illusion
It's already too late
Nothing can stop it, no, not even fate
Under The Ice
The sinners are waiting in line at the doorway to hell
As they're rubbing their bellies and pushing the crap that they sell
Now send us your money and we'll give you blessings by mail
We're building empires and no one will stand in our way
And they know, you're walking the endless mile
Your colours are fading, the hangman they smile
Cause you're under the ice
And now you are fated to pay the price
While heaven is waiting
The sinners are laughing alone
You are under the ice
Just like the others have been before
While heaven is waiting
You're all going under the ice, again
Follow the masses, obey like you're puppets on strings
In the eyes of the world you are sacred, it's making us kings
Call Out To The World
I’ve rushed a million miles, haven’t moved at all
Just like the rats, I will keep on going
I’ve severed all my ties, set up for my fall
And just like that, I’m back at square one
Take me, somewhere
Wake me from this nightmare
Hear me, call out to the world
Someone, somewhere
Save me if I fall, you’ll be my savior
Lead the way I call out to the world
All these countless bugs, crawling in my skin
I’m losing hope, and I’m, going nowhere
I’ve heard a million lies my patience’s wearing thin
Up to my throat, and I’ve, heard it all before
Never Again
Father, father, help me
I have sinned again
I just killed my last friend, can I go, can I go?
Father please relieve me
From this cross I bear
Couldn’t help myself, can’t we let it be?
No, never again
Never the same, my friend
I owe my lesson learned
Never again
I’ll never crash and burn again, again, again
Father, father hear me
I am on my knees
And our dirty secrets, I won’t tell, I won’t tell
I got the shortest straw here
You’re really nowhere near
To each his own, I’m better off alone
You’ll never, you’ll never learn
Just burn your bridges
I’ll never, I’ll never fall again
Not The Only
Lying awake, alone in my bed
Voices are calling from inside my head
You’d be surprised, if you knew what they really said
From my dark rooms, I’ve shut the world out
I hide from the word can’t you see,
(it’s) too painful to talk about
I’m not what I used to be
Some things we leave alone
And wish that we’d never known
And sometimes we go too far
To hide our scars
I am not the only,
The only one who runs
No, I am not the only one
And when it’s down
To wire we all run
I’m not the only one
Break down the door
Let in the light
I’m not the same anymore,
I have to come clean you know
These loose ends just got to go
Tell Me
On this dead end road
You just sold yours souls
Buying in on what they told
High and mighty you
And your washed-out smiles
Tell me now, who’s fooling who?
Won’t be afraid no more
Here you found what you’re looking for
Settle for less, round up the clowns,
Obliterate this mess
Say your prayers, little one
And tell me, yeah tell me
After all is said and done
Tell me now, tell me now
I see right through you
How you cry on cue
That’s just all you’ve left to do
Not Like You
It’s time to go,
We know there’s something calling
There’s nothing left out here at all, no…
We’re going crazy, it’s no illusion
We’ve had enough, so here we are
Who walks a thin line?
And who’s running on the edge?
This time we know it’s real
We’re falling face down, right into the ground
We are not like you, we are not the same
Not like the fools who follow and live their lives tomorrow
No, we are not like you, we are not the same
And so the story ends, we will never be like you
We’ve had enough, there must be something better
We turn our backs and walk away
We’re getting tired, of all you liars
We’ve heard it all too many times
Leave Me Alone
Name the sin, count me in
Remind me that we’re dreaming
Bleed me dry, then hang me high
And call me the fool that I’ve been
Hate this state that I’m in
Cause we’re back
We’re back to the same old story
We’re back
So leave me alone, leave me alone again
Pour me out, run me down
And bore me till I’m done for
Wash me up, say no more
Leave me what’s left on the floor
Till I Come Alive
Woke up today, no hope for tomorrow
What I thought would wash away
Needless to say, I’d kind of lost my way
So I’m right here, waiting
No more, no more
Won’t stop trying till I know I’m alive
No way, no way
No denying till I come alive
I turned on a dime,
And counted my blessings
So no more wasting time
Wiped out the slate,
And finally turned the page
And I’m right here, waiting
No, thought I still believe in nothing
Never crawling, never falling
I’ll never be like you
Strong Enough
One bad seed in this filty gravel
One bad turn on this crocked road
Took me here, to this path I travel
Made me pay for what I owed
One black cloud on my silver lining
One bad turn that I can’t through
Someone else when I look in the mirror
Someone new in the tainted glass
No, I can’t stand it
Here I go, all alone
It’s time I made it on my own
They tried to make me, tried to brake me
But I’m strong enough
Tried to mold, shape and make me
On my back, like a bad tattoo
Here I am, still torn and ragged
Half a man, that’ll have to do
Me
One, just one more drink
One last cigarette and I am on my way
Oh last night, it’s all a haze
Here I pave my way through filth and broken glass
Something is not the same
Something is different from before
Guess that I, guess I died inside
When there’s nothing more
When I’d tried it all
Come undone, when the odds were close to none
When the moment’s there
The divide I beware
Then it’s me, only me
Torn, still torn and bruised
But I’ve had my run, and I’ll, I’ll see it through
All for you, my sweet farewell
Oh, I can’t believe that I survived this hell
Pain & Pleasure
Hear you call for me
It’s too late, can’t you see?
Couldn’t help, they spit on you, and called you fool
I believe it just slipped my mind
That I left you behind
I can’t help, you died that day that I betrayed
On and on…
Pain or pleasure
There is no distinction
You will see, someday
That pain is just one step away
Pain or pleasure
There is no distinction
Wish I could explain
That pleasure is equal to pain
I am over you
I keep telling myself
Couldn’t help,
They made you plead,
Made you bleed
I am sorry for what they did
Wasn’t me, god forbid
It hit me now, I’m just like them,
Or worse somehow
Now you’re gone…
