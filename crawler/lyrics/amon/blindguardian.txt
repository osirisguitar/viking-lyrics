Halloween
Years ago I came back.
This'll be my hardest attack.
Burning fire in my brain.
I can feel the deadly flame.
You'll never make it, your blood I suck.
Your fire's burning round my neck.
Celebration, let the day.
Hunting me down, there's no escape.
There's no way out, but trying to escape.
You're just insane, can't catch me.
Halloween, I'm sent to hear his voice on Halloween.
Halloween, can feel the Kiss of Death on Halloween.
When you feel the Kiss of Death,
there's nothing you can do.
An angel sent me to destroy and kill.
Yeah.
You see the X, but it's too late.
It's in your head and you are dead.
There's no way out, they tell us.
Can feel the Kiss of Death.
There's nothing in my head but blood.
Halloween, I'm sent to hear his voice on Halloween.
Halloween, can feel the Kiss of Death on Halloween.
This gaining dawn I feel.
Just tell me how this is real.
Is it the end of me and you?
Can feel the Kiss of Death.
There's nothing in my head but blood.
Halloween, I'm sent to hear his voice on Halloween.
Halloween, can feel the Kiss of Death on Halloween.
Halloween, I'm sent to hear his voice on Halloween.
Brian
When the sky is burning,
see the Moon falling down.
On your right is lightning.
See the war in the sky.
Remember Brian,
when it's time.
Remember Brian.
All our empty heads
discover the war in the sky.
Don't need no revolution
by the birthday of Brian.
Remember Brian,
when it's time.
Remember Brian.
When the end is nearing,
see him hanging on the cross.
A war in the sky
now by the ending of Brian.
Remember Brian,
when it's time.
Remember Brian.
Dead Of The Night
Every night I hear thunder.
The shadow, can't you see?
So one night I will follow.
The dark side reigns in me.
(He) leads me to the dark plains.
The end is near, I feel.
But (I've) never seen his damned face.
My hearts pound hard in fear.
Dead of the night, take me away.
Dead of the night, he's looking for you.
A hundred solemn faces,
they look at me and laugh.
But if one wants to touch them,
they glow through nothingness.
If I come to tell you,
you look at me and laugh.
I never found the doctor,
so one day I'll be mad.
In that night I follow.
No pain, no work, no more.
He leads me on through the dark realm.
My sense grows far too dense.
Dead of the night, take me away.
Dead of the night, he's looking for you.
They will not take me easy.
No love will come through death.
I take them on and kill myself.
And just feel emptiness.
Now you see them rising,
but no one knows but me.
So, don't try (to) follow a demon
and wait for a last attack.
In that night I follow.
No pain, no work, no more.
He leads me on through the dark realm.
My sense grows far too dense.
Dead of the night, take me away.
Dead of the night, he's looking for you.
Dead of the night.
Symphonies Of Doom
In the dark night (they) defend their missiles,
where it's the night we all die.
Enthralling power, who searches to be masters.
They play their game with your life.
The burning fire comes around, the heat is on
Just for this day, it's all sad blues.
The East Sun is burning hard.
See, your life is short.
See the rainbow in the mirror.
See the rainbow in the sky.
See the desert in front of you.
See the desert of life.
Standing in the cold rain, waiting for the end.
See the shadows of the night.
I have told you, but now it is too late.
These are Symphonies of Doom.
Feel the danger, this final battle.
It will imply us all God's agony.
The endless blitzes just blind your eyes shut
And blow your life out to nothingness.
Black shadows storming in the East, but you can't see.
The liec has set that power free.
The East Sun is burning hard.
See, the life is short.
See the rainbow in the mirror.
See the rainbow in the sky.
See the desert in front of you.
See the desert of life.
I'm no sinner. I'm no fool.
I have heard these chants before.
I have told you, but now it is too late.
These are Symphonies of Doom.

Inquisition
Banish From Sanctuary
In deserts I was preaching
The hand of god was with me
Baptized with water and I praised
The one who came behind me
To save us all with the holy ghost
A prophet of the fools I've been lost
I'm sure you're there wandering around
But do you care for me I'm alone
You talk of love not for me
In my dungeon cold I could think about
All the things you've said
But I can't understand your famous son
I left the way of heaven or did you leave me from it?
No, no, turning back
I'm banished from sanctuary
The darkness in me is filling me with pain
There's no way to turn back for eternity
In shadows I'm walking and caught in loneliness
Deliverance I wait for but how long?
Are you the one who should come show me the light in you
Or should we wait for someone? Another!
Your Reich should come to this world
Your way smoothed by my blood, friend
My might will decrease but you'll get
High, yes so much higher be careful of the rats, friend
'Cause they'll never sleep before they catch you, too
The blind can see the sun,
cripples walk alone
The deaf can hear my words
they believe, just believe
They believe in me.
Look! The signs are near
To perform my task, to perform my way
To perform the way I walked
The way of the crucifix
I hear the hangman coming, I wait for execution
Damned For All Time
Conquer the whole world to satisfy
Their lust for pain and terror
Disguise their faces to hide them
In the dark Determination
The oath on the runestaff is the highest
The ruin of a nation Step by step Destiny
Damned for all time - but what's time
Tales of the one who's born to change
And as the earth was old and cold
She closed her eyes and fell to sleep
Violation ruled the world
The dark kingdom's time
He's called Hawkmoon wearing a sign
Black jewel in his head
He's the one who's forever there
He's born a thousand times
Damned for all time In every age he existed
Damned for all time In every future he'll live
For all time He's crying He's crying
Hey strange one I know you're standing there
The faces are they mine?
Are you out there?
Watch out for the day, friend I'll know your name
Hear my laughter
Oblivion - who's blowing the horn
Oblivion - who's killing the gods
 Damned...
Dark kingdom's lost now. No pain storms the land
Strange things are happening. Changing of all planes
In the universe by a bad magician
To conquer the power of this magic
A place where truth waits must be found Tanelorn
Damned for all time - who am I?
Once I've been called Erekose
I was Elric - I'll be Corum I'm the prince of the south ice
Now I'm nothing Wait for someone Wait for Ilian No! I'm Hawkmoon
Oblivion - the war is eternal
Oblivion - the battle is endless
 Damned...
Follow The Blind
Follow the blind
Your journey, your last hope, it can begin
These passing dreams were real not fantasy
There are more things than we know Come take my hand
Searching for the talisman you'll find it
On another plane far from all time
Maybe you wonder while you see The same faces
Everywhere You can find yourself in it
'cause you're a part
I'm another Strange my feelings Where I am here For a short time
I remember I had been here
I'm alone, follow me!
Calling you, follow me!
I'm alone, follow me!
Follow the blind
Follow me
Follow me it's my time
Follow me
Follow the blind
Wandering in my darkest dreams Iron shadows are lurking at me
In this desert the tyrant's calling On the run to save my love
She's full of pain The queen is lying far behind
In an endless dream
Before I thought I was dreaming
A strange voice whispers in my ears
You're the rat in the trap
Return, pain will come to you
Ref: I'm alone...No!
Hall Of The King
Alone I walk, hearing a voice, That's calling my name
No one with you, God, why I didn't care
On through death take me away
To the place time will not fade
Colder than dead, Darkness - eternity, But look out
A hundred thousand centuries The sun had never seen
So near but much too far Eternal place you know what's life
But cannot tell
I can never see you changing But you look to me
Time will never heal your wounds But you're immortal
Hall of the King a vision of the end
Hall of the King don't cry for us
Don't hear us calling Oh watch out for me Hall of the light
My last sin
You find yourself, just take a look To see you must open your eyes
Like a hawk in the sky, a wonder that dies Don't ask me why
You're the birth and you're the end
You've been hurt but you're not dead
Discovering you is what should never be
Poisoned are our souls, And dark our hearts
Ruins we have left to rule the world
Destructive are our minds, It's much too late
 Hall...
Fast To Madness
White hair and red eyes he is holding the crown
The king of the island Elric Melnibone
He's born for destruction
He's ruled by the Gods eternal hero
The scale of the universe
Blood on his hands he's born a thousand times
Why don't we feel the signs from the dragon king
Before the end of fire his journey starts
The eagle's spreading his wings following his fate
He's ruled from anywhere leads him to truth it's deep inside
Hail to the king they bless tonight He's the Saviour of our time
In a dark land far behind no one knows its name
There's a dark sword cold as ice A blade created for him
Stormbringer cries for the soul of everyone
Stormbringer cries "The ending has begun"
Run fast to madness Forever I
Run fast to madness Leave him alone
 Run...
Destiny calling him back to the island
And time? Time is standing still
Time is not real 
Armed with weapon awaiting the fight
He's leading the dragon The sun will never rise
Creatures are lurking in darkness they hide
High in the sky the dragon king is flying
Hail to the king of Melnibone
He's the Saviour of our time
Mourning desert rottenness Blade of dark will rise
Gods divine are hiding in the dark Needing Elric's hand
Stormbringer cries "I'm forged in darkest time"
Stormbringer cries "The ending has begun"
 Run...
Beyond The Ice
Valhalla
High in the sky where eagles fly Morgray the dark enters the throne
Open wide the gate friend the king will come
Blow the horn and praise the highest lord
Who'll bring the dawn he's a new god in the palace of steel
Persuade the fate of everyone The chaos can begin let it in
So many centuries, so many gods
We were the prisoners of our own fantasy
But now we are marching against these gods
I'm the wizard, I'll change it all
Valhalla - Deliverance
Why've you ever forgotten me 
Magic is in me
I'm the last magic man
Never found what I was looking for
Now I found it but it's lost
The fortress burns
Broken my heart
I leave this world
All gods are gone
So many centuries, so many gods
We were the prisoners of our own fantasy
But then we had nothing to lead our life
No, no, we can't live without Gods
 Valhalla...
Don't Break The Circle
Don't break the circle
Don't break the circle
Concentrate!
I'm your contact link across the great divide
Many voices in my ear
Hold on I think there's something coming through
From the other side. It's for all those who believe
The chain is stronger if the lifeline is unbroken
So beware the presence of The Unexpected Guest
Don't break the circle
Don't break the circle
Unexplained
Many things we thought were lost may come to light
On a higher plain in the spirit world
Where only a few of us possess the second sight
Now the messenger awaits
The chain is stronger if the lifeline is unbroken
So beware the presence of The Unexpected Guest
Don't break the circle
Don't break the circle.The circle must keep going on and on
But wait
Is there one amongst us here who believes?
A stranger to the sign
Take care, for all the things you fear
May be revealed
Within the forces of the night
The chain is stronger if the lifeline is unbroken
So beware the presence of The Unexpected Guest
Don't break the circle
Don't break the circle
Don't break the circle
Don't break the circle
The circle must keep going on and on
The circle must keep going on and on
Majesty
Now the time has come for me to leave this land
Take my charge with pride sacrifice
Running and hiding I'm left for the time
To bring back the order of divine
Hunted by goblins no Gandalf to help
With swords in the night
Oh the last part of the game
Decision of death and life
Blood for Sauron they'll call tonight
The final battle cry
Running and hiding I'm left for the time
To bring back the order of divine
There exist no tales and hobbits are crying for all
Children of death
I have a dream the things you've to hide for
Deliver our kingdom and our Reich
Don't fall in panic just give me the thing
That I need or I kill
Don't run away for what have I done
Oh majesty your kingdom is lost
And you'll leave us behind
Oh majesty your kingdom is lost
And ruins remind of your time
Now come back
Run, run, run
Cries Cries in a dark land
Hear the voice it's cold as ice
Eyes they are watching
They look for me but cannot find
Creature is following no place to escape
My last steps will find the right way
Where's the future the call of the blind
Cause there is none to find
Watch the sky you see no light
My weapons burst with fear
With the howling wolves the nazgul will die
For all Children of death
Cries Cries in a dark land
Hear the voice it's cold as ice
Eyes they are watching
They look for me but cannot find
Run Run for the whole world
It's time you cannot wait
Lost Lost in a dark world
You feel the strange but cannot see
Too many battles we carry along from the war
And too many frightens we feel from his law
For so many victories we're praising so strong
For so many blood we've lost
Run, run
Guardian Of The Blind
Extermination thunder the strange one is

Lost by our only power it's aura will grind us

We're watching our own agony many years ago
Seven little children stand against the ghost
Believing is the answer but you've lost before
Find back to your infancy it's time to die

killing for the thirst for small children sweat
I give them illusions to raise their fear
Hear the crying dying child it's music to my ears
Feel the sweetness of it's death everything's allright
But there's a new feeling I've never known
There must be a third one a mighty guardian

Once we were a circle fighting hand in hand
Our weapons were illusions to let it feel the pain
By the sweet taste of our live it call us back again
We'll find the answer it's time to die

Trial By The Archon
Wizard's Crown
Years ago I came back
this has been my hardest attack
A burning fire's in my brain
I could feel the deadly flame
Tales of the magic in my head
to a dark dream I fall in my mind
I hold the key of fortune
To feel the strange thing's in my mind
the stone of Ambar I must find
I'll take the chance that day
Halloween - The wizards crown I'll take on
Halloween
Halloween - But there is no return on Halloween
I'm the servant of the Blind to cross the
realms of death
the gate is open wide you cannot close
His dungeons deep no place to hide
The times have changed he has to fight
In magic spell I fall
Illusions falling in my mind
But where's the key I cannot find
the ritual has begun
The battle has begun
the warlocks time has come
I pay the price I've to pay
Why haven't see the signs
I'm loosing now my life
but cannot die forever life
Halloween - The wizards crown I'll take on
Halloween
Halloween - But there is no return on Halloween
Halloween - The wizards crown I'll take on
Run For The Night
There comes the last part and end of our old age
with thunder and lightning the dark lord is taking
the crown of the whole world
his creature will kill me and poisons my soul
to the end I'll fight but I know that the things
that I do are so meanless - Oh no
I see the hill but it's so far away
I know I can't reach it
but I try it again and again in my dark dreams
he's waysting my last will how long can I stay here
when the mightiest of all will now
Run for the Night burn away
the times of his fall I've to pay
Visions of darkness prepared for the last strike
and blooddlust their weapons and madness
you see their
eyes there's no way out
I'm lost in a dark dream and losing control
to the end I'll fight but I know that the things
that I do are so meanless - Oh no
I see the hill but it's so far away
I know I can't reach it
but try it again and again in my dark dreams
he's waysting my last will
how long can I stay here
who the mightiest of all will now
You see them running in the shadows of the night
It is not what it used to be
they've been scared and they've been anxiously tonight
you them running with the wind they
run for the night 
The Martyr
He was born in the past time
To take all our pain
The kingdom of heaven's near
The children of this time
Must die for his arrive
To let all the legends be true
The prophecy said they'll call king of the Jews
He is born now to take all our sins
Three kings were searching for this holy child
The journey begins, he has to die
Healing the cripples and taking our pain
He came for the sinner
But what we've said
Disciples are following
They are calling his words
Salt of the earth and light of the world
Martyr - we are following you
Bless us for eternity
Messiah - we are torturing you
When you lose the power of your words
Jump from the temple and angle will save
Show me that you are the son of our God
Now take my land with my power you get
Rulin' the world of tomorrow
Messiah liar our burning desire
He is the king without a crown
We'll set him to his throne
Give me p of silver and I'll be your man
Higher liar the fallen Messiah
Let us see his agony
The things he done are blasphemy
Mob has lost their joy on toy
So let us kill him fast
Now drink my blood for the new testament
This is my body you eat
One of you twelve is the one who betrays
Better that he's never born
Judas you're the chosen one
The world has damned your name
Begin with a kiss
At a cross it will end
The kingdom of heaven we've passed
The sky will turn black and the curtain will fall
The father's crying for his son
The tortured Messiah is finding his way
The journey has come to the end
The twelve ones are preaching the words he'd left
They're changing the way of the world but die for
Martyr - we are following you
Bless us for eternity
No
Battalions Of Fear
Can't believe the things I see
That happens in the state
By a mortal distance that I can't believe
Self destructive infernal
To save us from the breed
But I know that it is all a lie
Star wars begin now
His bombs come exploding
To bring back the death of the night
No mercy he's knowing
How strong he must show us
For the last film you all get a part
Be by my side
Or you've to die
Believe what I do is the right
Soon Armageddon
Last hours are running now
The final solution begins
The words of a madman
No children to tell them
For what they'll not see in the light
Choose by your voice
He kills and destroys
At the end you must die for the night
In earlier chess games
We're playing the part of a soldier
But now we are not qualified
To save our own life
The traps are all placed by command
They are ready to strike
We live and we'll die
By the lies to believe
Try to escape from this suicide dreams
Or past time will come back again
Hiroshima is a joke to that what will come
At the end of the game we all die
Die now
Battalions of fear
They search and they scream
For the American dreams
Battalions of fear
The way of R.R.
To show he is the star
Battalions
Star wars
With hands full of blood
He talks about peace
With snake poisoning tongue
He's praying
El Salvador and Vietnam
You soon fast forget
But you satisfy on Afghanistan
You've been the master
You kill with a laughter
Your screams of peace are wrong and loud
Cause so we are and here we are
We scream and shout!
Your laughing about all the fools
Scream and shout!
With power of evil they stand
By The Gates Of Moria
Gandalf's Rebirth
Traveler In Time
The Morning Sun of Dune
The Morning Sun of Dune
The holy war's
waiting for
the morning sun 
The morning sun of Dune
there's no tomorrow
the apparation of this land and it's dream
makes me feel I've seen it before
I can taste there's life
everywhere you can find
in the desert of my life
I see it again and again
And again, again, again, again
dark tales have brought the Dijahd
like whispering echos in the wind
and I'm a million miles from home
Traveler in time
knowing that there's no rhyme
The morning sun is near
first light of dawn is here
the morning sun is near again
The Fremen sing that
their kingdom will come
and I'm the leading one
battlefields on our crusade
filled with Sardokaurs
killing machines crying
in raising fear they're hiding
Where do we go now?
So where is the way?
When I'm a million miles from home
The morning sun I feel
all pain and sorrow
the apparition of my words in these days
makes me feel I've told them before
all my plans will come true
I'll control destiny
in the desert of my life
I've seen it again and again
By my dreams I must find the way
to stop the raging war
I've to choose now
I will leave
my body and see
and time will stand still
when I have to leave
my body and find
a way back to the world I love
when I'm a million miles from home
Welcome To Dying
Close to insanity
beyond the realms I've been
at darkest places
I'm crying
"The dragon flies"
Something savage
is yearning for me
I'm waiting afraid for the night
what will be
I've lost myself
a few days ago
it's touching my soul
and a vision of past dreams comes true
Welcome to dying
I don't let it out
Welcome to dying
Look to the mirror it shows what I am
Welcome to dying
This town must burn now
Welcome to dying
Can't you see the dragon's seed bears in me
the one who's been before
many times I terrorized this town
many times and here I start again
now I'm stronger and so cold
cold as ice
returning is my destiny
now I feel it's growing up in me
now I feel it's burning deep in me
I'm not what I was before
could I stop this dream
I'm a stranger to myself
and I cannot control
Welcome to dying
I don't let it out
Welcome to dying
Look to the mirror it shows what I am
Welcome to dying
Can't you see the dragon's seed bears in me
Welcome to dying
The dragon's breath I don't let it out
I'm a savage
it's too late for me
the other side's taking control and I know
there's one way I can walk alone
or the dragon will fly
and a growing fear's all that I feel
Welcome to dying 
Can't you see the dragon's seed bears in me
Spread my wings and fly away
I spread my wings and fly away
I spread my wings and fly away
Weird Dreams
Lord Of The Rings
There are signs on the ring which make me feel so down
There's one to enslave all rings to find them all in time
And drive them into darkness
Forever they'll be bound
Three for the Kings of the elves high in light
Nine to the mortal which cry
Slow down and I sail on the river
Slow down and I walk to the hill
And there's no way out
Mordor
Dark land under Sauron's spell
Threatened a long time
Threatened a long time
Seven rings to the gnomes in their halls made of stone
Into the valley
I feel down
One ring for the dark lord's hand sitting on his throne
In the land so dark where I have to go
Lord of the rings
Goodbye My Friend
Who can tell me who I am
who I am my friend
I'm an Alien so they say
a risk to everyone
No - Tell me what do they see
No - Tell me what do they feel
No - Tell me what do they fear
No - Tell me what do they see
I'm a dwarf but I know more than you
and I'm a key to a better life
from terror I could escape
but I need your helping hand
so far from home where I'm left alone
Did you hear my crying?
Did you hear my crying?
Goodbye my friend
I found you at the end
I say Goodbye to all
Goodbye my friend
thanks for your helping hand
I say Goodbye to all my cries
just say Goodbye
No returning nevermore
No returning nevermore
And I'll remember
Communication to you is so strange
You trust to no one no warmths reach your heart
to you I'm the stranger but you're strange to me
You destruct all what is unknown to you
We are together now
and don't you know I'll come back again
I must go now
 Goodbye...
I will go home now
I will go home now
much too long I'm forced to stay
in visions I see
so dark and so deep
mankind will destruct all life
See you again I hope I will
see you again at the end?
My tortured soul can't forget the pain
now I find my way back
I WILL GO HOME NOW
I WILL GO HOME NOW
 Goodbye...
Lost In The Twilight Hall
Awaiting my last breath
the mirror calls my name
it's showing me the way
into the dark
the bridge appears
I jump into the dark side
and hear the voice it's cold as ice
"Welcome to reality"
Where am I now?
Darkness surrounds
can't go forward
can't go back
 I see planets dying
 I fall into the light
 a new universe awakens
 I'm a Traveler in Time
 Pray for the light
 Where's the key
 To the gate
 of a new life - no
 I search for deliverance
 But I cannot find
Look behind the mirror
I'm lost in the twilight hall
once I'll be back for a moment in time
that's when the mirror's falling down
Take me away
from the place I've been
to another life
in another world
a sign of life
surrounds me now
the bridge appears in the dark
I'm free
I fly alone
leaving this darkness now, forever?
the memories of children
and the wisdom of many lifes
burns deep in me
Where will the light go to?
Where will the light go to?
Is this deliverance?
Is it the end?
 Look...
I'm back there's a new chance for me
and all my memories are gone
I can feel what's happening to me
and the mirror will burst
 Look... 
Tommyknockers
She's opening her eyes
to find the thing
by a touch she's lost
it's waiting for her a long time
the kingdom's lost
cause there's one nail missing
playing with fire
turn of the light
and she'll fall down
playing with her life
but she can't leave it
there's one rhyme in her brain
Oh, last night and the night before
Tommyknockers, Tommyknockers
knocked at your back door
Tommyknockers
The pain in my head
the cycle awakes
I'm on my way to Oz
I want to drink and she wants to dig
she's in trouble oh I know
there's something going wrong
Tommyknockers on their way
What's up in "Leighton street"?
Oh, last night and the night before
Tommyknockers, Tommyknockers
knocked at your back door
I'm the hero, I'm back
with weapons and with magic spells
I'll seddle every task
an old, ill and drunken guy
The moon is full of blood
I've found her not, not far from home
I should better get away from here
she's on her way to be another one
playing with fire
she can read my thoughts
it's too late
playing with her life
Tommyknockers brought her trouble
The ship in the earth I touch
a vibration is filling me
and music is in my head
nose is bleeding
and my fall down
filled me with pain
you'll be like a Tommyknocker
I'll be like you
but there's something going wrong
I read it in your face
Oh, last night and the night before
Tommyknockers, Tommyknockers
knocked at your back door
Tommyknockers knocked at your back door
Tommyknockers knocked at your back door
Altair 4
At Hilly's show
they didn't know
that the Ending of "Being" is near
I can feel their voices
the old man cries
"Please save the boy
he's caught in a world far behind
from home"
Monster Anne is crying out
"Feel my pain I can't escape"
Bad chances for me
Altair 4 
chosen by their whispering words
What is left behind?
When purple colors turn to black
Can you feel it?
Is there time?
Can you see it?
Is there life?
"Fly away and dream"
The Last Candle
Guardian, Guardian, Guardian of the Blind 
Have you forgotten him
Far from the land
where the sun is born
down in the wood "Caladon"
Do you know that place
where the light is never seen
and all hopes are turned
by the final cry
Turned to Stone 
Whispering tunes in the wind
all hopes are gone with the night
when the old man will never come back
remember his words and his songs
And we see the raven flying in the distance
but no wizard's singing his song
Somebodies out in the night
I fly in time
the last candle will burn
there's hope for everyone
when the last candle burns high
oh it's time for life
The elves and gnomes have to hide
when the moon is showing it's face
and raging orcs will set their traps
and all forests will burn
they hate green trees
and love the dark
they don't understand
that they're caught and left alone
they feel the magic in the wind
they just fear the old man's song
Somebodies...
Corrupted old gnome
betrayer of all
you know so much about all
what is your price?
"Too much, too much
you cannot pay with your silver and your gold
there's just a little chance to save the wizard's life
there's just a little chance for all you fools
now pay"
And so I walk across the land
and hope to hear the wizard's song
Somebodies... 
Somebodies out there
I feel there's somebody
Somebodies out there
I feel there's somebody
Run For The Night
There comes the last part and end of our old age
with thunder and lightning the dark lord is taking
the crown of the whole world
his creatures will kill me and poisons my soul
to the end I'll fight but I know that the things
that I do are meaningless - Oh no
I see the hill byt it's so far away
I know I can't reach it
but I try again and again in my dark dreams
he's waysting my last will how long can I stay here
when the mightiest of all will now
Run for the Night burn away
the times of his fall I've to pay
Visions of darkness prepared for the last strike
and bloodlust their weapons and madness
you see to their
eyes there's no way out
I'm lost in a dark dream and losing control
to the end I'll fight but I know that the things
that I do are so meanless - Oh no
I see the hill but it's so far away I know I can't
reach it
but try it again and again in my dark dreams
he's waysting my last will
how long can I stay here
when the mightiest of all will now
Run...
You see them running in the shadows of the night
it is not what it used to be
they've been scared and they've been anxiously tonight
you see them running with the wind they
run for the night 
Time What Is Time
When the moonchild is crying
And silence has broken
The darkest truth
The things she remembered
Had never been her own
Replicant or human
I know the way to show
What do I see
What will I find
Know the answer inside
It's your last step
Time what is time
I wish I knew how to tell you why
It hurts to know
Aren't we machines
Time what is time
Unlock the door
And see the truth
Then time is time again
These dreams were never mine
It's cold inside
It's gone forever
The things he saw
Who can say what's wrong or right
The vision of a free life
His eyes had seen it all
For what
He's asking
The vision, vision, vision
I know it's all a lie
I'll remember the past life
And I'll remember time
What did I see
What have I done
God I knew the answers
When he felt so tired
Time what is time
Come lock the door don't let me in
I am the one your destiny
Time what is time
Reality - it hurts me so
When time is time again
Look into my eyes
Feel the fear just for a while
I'm a replicant and I love to live
Is it all over now
Only these years
I'll leave but I'm singing
Time what is time
He saw it clearly it's too late
It does not heal but it lets us forget
Time what is time
We'll never know
So don't take care
Then time is time again
Should I forget
The way I feel
God he knows how long I tried
Feel there is no reason to cry
I live my life
In fortune dreams forever
Journey Through The Dark
Many songs I've written
About the things I saw
My inner soul's a wasteland
I can't run away from here
Try to find them
All the lost thoughts in my mind
I woke up on a hill
So many times before
Yesterday seems like a dream no more
Frozen memories laughing
They don't let me find the truth
Am I born to be a king
Or a jester of the fools
You're the mystical old bard
on your journey through the dark
Mystical old bard
Your journey through the dark
I can't remember my name
I never knew how to find my home
I can't remember my name
come tell me when will it end
I'm the chosen one
To perform all these things
But not for me
In illusions and reality
I'm on my journey through the dark
I'm on my journey through the dark
Mystical old bard
On your journey through the dark
Mystical old bard
Your journey through the dark
I can't remember
Will I ever find myself
The distance is growing
My hope has gone away
A flash of light but nothing changes
When will it end
Which part of me remains
Soon I'll be back
On my ferryboat of tales
Where oblivion reigns
It will take all of me
Mystical old bard
On your journey through the dark
Mystical old bard
Your journey through the dark
Black Chamber
I am lost in the black chamber
There's no way to turn back
It takes me down forevermore
And death would be so sweet
I'm possessed by the old creature
Who has planned all
To take my soul
Too late for me
In my hands
It lies I thought
But I failed
Now he's in me
My soul is lost
In his black chamber
I'm gone
Theatre Of Pain
The giant's lost
And all around him
Destructed for what
They all knew what it meant
But they couldn't change it
Lord they had gone too far
Leave them alone
It's all gone
What is left behind
On a desert we called earth
When the last whale went away
Did they ever see the tears
Don't fear your last step
From the theatre of pain
And the children will love your singing
From the sea
The sea is calling
Now we've to leave it
The sea was clear
On the day I was stranded
Answers I'd known
To keep this all alive
But I can't change it
Forever
Now I'm gone
And it seems that life has never existed
So we left the dark and cold
All I left behind are my tears
Don't fear your last step
From the theatre of pain
And the children will love your singing
From the sea
The sea is calling
I hear them calling
The Quest For Tanelorn
By the ruins he stands
And he's waiting for me
To enter Tanelorn
His paths seem strange
But they're always planned
Seldom he succeeds
About his own fate
He tries to conquer it
Again and again
But at last he's almost
A ruined man
Not a king or God
Who's searching for
A place called Tanelorn
Far beyond your dreams
On our quest for Tanelorn
We lose our way
On our quest for Tanelorn
He's waiting
He's waiting for me
He's waiting
He's waiting for me
Darkness falling down on me
Darkness - The eternal battle rises
I know the answers
Although they don't exist
I'm just a mortal illusion
On our quest for Tanelorn
We lose our way
On our quest for Tanelorn
So I'm his companion
Through space and through time
His eternal servant
He's calling me
So I must leave
To another life
To another world
Far beyond your dreams
To know the truth
Just for a while
He's longing for a place
Where he can find himself
Deliverance
It could be everywhere
How can he find
He's waiting for me
And for you
Tanelorn
On our quest for Tanelorn
We lose our way
On our quest for Tanelorn
We lose our way
On our quest for Tanelorn
We lose our way
On our quest for Tanelorn
We lose our way
Ashes To Ashes
Taste the poison
Feel that this is life
Hallowed be the game
Of life and innocence
God's waiting for him
Join us at the road to fate
There are two paths
Feel the pain
Which steps into his life
Agony
He'll be crucified
Death awaits
Knocking at his door
Agony
Leave him
The clock will strike the end
Hell or heaven
Reflect and fade away
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust
The life clock strikes and you obey
Like a candle light that fades
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust
When the life clock strikes you obey
Time isn't here to stay
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust
The life clock strikes and you obey
A light shows the right way
Morning is whispering in my head
Too late to say goodbye
Too late
The last breath's done
Deliverance and all
He's born to find his end
I am the one
The one who's calling
Obey my call to the cemetery
And don't be afraid
To step into the dark
Be sure that my voice
will take you home
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust
The life clock strikes and you obey
Like a candle light that fades
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust
When the life clock strikes you obey
Time isn't here to stay
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust
No hope he'd waited so long
This can't be God's will
He surrendered long ago
There was no real chance
Ashes to ashes, and dust will be dust
Ashes to ashes, you all will be dust again
The clock has struck the end
Up to heaven
Reflexions fade away
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust
The life clock strikes and you obey
Like a candle light that fades
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust
When the life clock strikes you obey
Time isn't here to stay
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust
The life clock strikes and you obey
Light shows the right way
Taste the poison
Feel that this is life
Hallowed be the game!
The Bard's Song - In The Forest
Now you all know
The bards and their songs
When hours have gone by
I'll close my eyes
In a world far away
We may meet again
But now hear my song
About the dawn of the night
Let's sing the bards' song
Tomorrow will take us away
Far from home
No one will ever know our names
But the bards' songs will remain
Tomorrow will take it away
The fear of today
It will be gone
Due to our magic songs
There's only one song
Left in my mind
Tales of a brave man
Who lived far from here
Now the bard songs are over
And it's time to leave
No one should ask you for the name
Of the one
Who tells the story
Tomorrow will take us away
Far from home
No one will ever know our names
But the bards' songs will remain
Tomorrow all will be known
And you're not alone
So don't be afraid
In the dark and cold
'Cause the bards' songs will remain
They all will remain
In my thoughts and in my dreams
They're always in my mind
These songs of hobbits, dwarfs and men
And elves
Come close your eyes
You can see them too
The Bard's Song - The Hobbit
Out in the distance
There's so much gold
The treasure that I've found
Is more than enough
Far to the hill we've to go
Over the mountains and seas
To the old hill
Where the old dragon sleeps
Blind in the dark dungeon's night
So God please take me away from here
And Gollum shows the way right out
I'm alive
The dying dragon brought trouble and pain
And horror to the halls of stone
I'll take the mighty stone
And leave the dwarfs behind
Ice and fire and forest we passed
And horror in the halls of stone
Trolls in the dark
The dawn took them all
Caught in the wood
By the wooden king's men
But now I'm alone
'Cause I've made up my mind
By the spell of gold
The king under the mountain
Will risk the great war
Oh what a fool
He's losing control
So I am trying to find a way
Blind in the dark dungeon's night
Then darkness comes from the northern side
And Thorin clears his mind
The Piper's Calling
Somewhere Far Beyond
I came from far
Beyond your reality
The ocean of time
It's the odyssey of mine
I am the narrator
And now I'll tell you
Where I've been
And what I saw
And how it ends
Welcome to the wasteland
In a world that's turning faster
Where I'm alone for a while
It's turning faster
Away from light straight to the dark
The march of time it has begun
I'm caught in an ancient dream so bright
And then the march of time begins
The man in black he waits
Behind this last task
It's full of pain
To sacrifice the only son
The legions of the lost
Wait in the old mine
They try to stop me
The battle it has begun
So I'm not afraid
To walk down the wasteland
I'm so alone on my way
And I don't fear that dusty godforsaken path
Somewhere far beyond
Somewhere far beyond
The march of time it has begun
Somewhere far beyond your reality
And then the march of time begins
Look at my soul
And behind
There are some thins
I've to hide from you
I'm following the black man
I'm losing control
And I don't care
What's happening to the boy
Welcome to a new world
One more step to the dark tower
And my whole body's in flames
I'm looking for
Those healing things to be prepared
The march of time it has begun
I'm caught in a prisoner's dirty life
And then the march of time begins
The prisoner did bring the healing spell
The queen of shadows found herself in pain
And death brings answers to us all
What will I find
When the dark tower appears
Will it be the end
Or just a new quest after all
I am the narrator
And now I'll tell you
Where I'd been
And what I saw
And how it ends
Somewhere far beyond
The march of time it has begun
Somewhere far beyond your reality
And then the march of time...
Somewhere far beyond
The march of time it has begun
Somewhere far beyond your reality
And then the march of time begins
Look around and see
The world is turning fast
Faster day by day
Somewhere far beyond
I'll try to change it
If I can - Somewhere far beyond
There's only one chance
And it lies - Somewhere far beyond
Somewhere far beyond
The march of time it has begun
The march of time it has begun
Spread Your Wings
Sammy was low,
just watching the show,
over and over again.
He knew it was time,
he'd made up his mind,
to leave his dead life behind.
His boss said to him
boy, you'd better begin
to get those crazy notions
right out of your head
Sammy who do you think that you are?
You should have been sweeping,
at the emerald bar.
spread your wings and fly away,
fly away, far away.
Spread your little wings and fly away
fly away, far away.
Pull yourself together,
'cause you know you should do better,
that's because you're a free man.
He spends his evenings alone,
in his hotelroom.
Keeping his thoughts to himself,
he'd be leaving soon.
Wishing he was miles and miles away,
nothing in this world, nothing,
would make him stay.
Since he was small,
had no luck at all,
nothing came easy to him.
Now it was time,
he'd made up his mind,
this could be my last change
His boss said to him
now listen boy, you're always dreaming,
you got no real ambition,
you won't get worried for.
Sammy, boy don't you know who you are?
why can't you be happy,
at the emerald bar?
(So honey) spread you wings and fly away,
fly away, far away.
spread your little wings and fly away,
fly away, far away.
pull yourself together,
'cause you know you should do better,
that's because your a free man.
come on honey (fly with me)...
Trial By Fire
In 1the year it came to be
Their fate decided
many miles across the sea
They told them not to fear
they couldn't be prepared.
Then came the day
that not a single soul was spared.
Too late there's no escape
The Trial has begun
Down they fly
From out of the sky
Feel the radiation burn !
The men of power
had nothing to fear.
When the finger hits the switch
they're far away from here.
Down in their sanctuary
hiding in their lair.
The sorcerers of justice
will be waiting for them there.
Too late there's no escape
The Trial has begun
Down they fly
From out of the sky
Feel the radiation burn !
I saw the people running
through all my dreams.
I heard the soldiers crying,
Mother Nature screams.
I saw destruction falling
from out of the sky.
I heard the Wise Man calling .... WHY ???????
In 1the year it came to be

Theatre Of Pain
The giant's lost
And all round him
Destructed for what
They all knew what it meant
But they couldn't change it
Lord they had gone too far
Leave them alone
It's all gone
What is left behind
On a desert we called earth
When the last whale went away
Did they ever see the tears
Don't fear Your last step
From the theatre of pain
And the children will love Your singing
From the sea
The sea is calling
Now we've to leave it
The sea was clear
On the day I was stranded
Answers I'd known
To keep this all alive
But I can't change it
Forever
Now I'm gone
And it seems that life had never existed
So we left the dark and cold
All I left behind are my tears
Don't fear Your last step
From the theatre of pain
And the children will love Your singing
From the sea
The sea is calling
I hear them calling
Imaginations From The Other Side
Where are these silent faces
I took them all
They all went away
Now you're alone
To turn out every light so deep in me
Hold on, too late
Will I ever see them back again
Or did they all die by my hand
Or were they killed
By the old evil ghost
Who had taken
The ocean
Of all my dreams
Which were worth to keep
Deep inside my heart
I wish I
Could get them back
From the everflow
Before they'll fade away
Imaginations from the other side
Far out of nowhere
It got back to my mind
Imaginations from the other side
Far out of nowhere
It got back to my mind
Out of the dark
Back to the light
Then I'll break down
The walls around my heart
Imaginations from the other side
Where's the ocean's daughter
Was Peter Pan in Mordor
No one's there to keep alive
All these fairy tales
May I return to Oz
Will I meet the "Tin Man"
"Coward Lion" where are you
Without brain the scarecrow's lost
In the middle of the lake
Stranded in the real world
Left in the world
No place for daydreams
Serious life
I fall into
I fall into a dark hole
And I can't come out
Do you know if Merlin did exist
Or Frodo wore the ring
Did Corum kill the gods
Or where's the wonderland
Which young Alice had seen
Or was it just a dream
I knew the answers
Now they're lost for me
Imaginations from the other side
Far out of nowhere
It got back to my mind
Imaginations from the other side
Far out of nowhere
It got back to my mind
Out of the dark
Back to the light
Then I'll break down
The walls around my heart
Imaginations from the other side
I hope there is a way back
With my talisman
So I look into myself
Into the days when I was just a child
Come follow me to wonderland
And see the tale that never ends
Don't fear the lion nor the witch
I can't come back
I'm lost but still I know
There is another world
Imaginations from the other side
Far out of nowhere
It got back to my mind
Imaginations from the other side
Far out of nowhere
It got back to my mind
Out of the dark
Back to the light
Then I'll break down
The walls around my heart
Imaginations from the other side
I'm Alive
I run through the dark fields
Of the plains
Reach level 99
The pain cuts deep down
Through my vain
How will I break the ice
Welcome to my reality
Dream forever
Sunlight instead of neon light
How will it be
Welcome to my grave
And feel the dream is over
Nothing can stop me
I reach out for the top
Caught in an old cage
The system failed
Built up on lies
Now I see that I'm alone
In asylum's cage
I'm left alone
I'm alive my friend
I can feel the shadows everywhere
I'm alive
I left the shadows
Far behind me
Another one is waiting in the dark
They say the system keeps
The last chance to survive
Caught in this labyrinth
Of walls and lot's of lies
Then I began to understand
There's more above then ice
To reach the top
I crept deep down
The answers given in the past
A senseless worth
In useless brains
Magic runes
Without a meaning
Besides the dark
There should be nothing left
Caught in an old cage
The system failed
Built up on lies
Now I see that I'm alone
In asylum's cage
I'm left alone
I'm alive my friend
I can feel the shadows everywhere
I'm alive
I left the shadows
Far behind me
Another one is waiting in the dark
Outside they say death is waiting
But it creeps down through the shaft
Finds pleasure in our helpless fear
Fills empty rooms with morbid thought
They've locked the door
And hold the key
Sitting beside you
When silent screams
Changing my mind and dreams
Oh, it's never ending
Caught in an old cage
The system failed
Built up on lies
Now I see that I'm alone
In asylum's cage
I'm left alone
I'm alive my friend
I can feel the shadows everywhere
I'm alive
I left the shadows
Far behind me
Another one is waiting
In the dark
I'M ALIVE!
A Past And Future Secret
Oh, I haven't been here for a while
In blindness and decay
The circle's been closed, now
My song of the end
I've seen it all
Listen crowd
I'll tell you everything
Though I have to say
I didn't know much
Talking about a past
And future secret
Most call him once
And future king
Far back in the past
I saw his ending
Long before it started
I knew his name
He's the one who took the sword
Out of the stone
It's now that ancient tale began
I hear it in the cold winds
My song of the end
I had seen it in my dreams
My song of the end
I can't stop the darkening clouds
I feel cold
When I cry out for the bark
Take him back to Avalon
Dwell on for the new age
So long sleep well my friend
Take him back to Avalon
I will wait and guard
The future king's crown
My song of the end
It was nice but now it's gone
My song of the end
It was fixed the whole time
My song of the end
I saw it all
The Script For My Requiem
Hallowed be the fatherland
God he knows
How long I'd been away
From here I did start for the search so
Full of disease
I still hear my cry outs
From the old cellar's inside
Born in the days of medieval
My inner voice
Is always asking why
I came from nowhere
Without a task, without a name
Don't fear my evil
Fate, so god please lead me through
Forgotten realms
Mysterious dreams
In sunless rooms I'd sworn
I'll finish what I started, once
I'll find the holy grail
In the holy land
Returning of the miracles
It's my own requiem
The jester's tears
They are inside me
Agony's the script for my requiem
Returning of the miracles
It's my own requiem
Is the script already written
Jester's tears I cry
Yes, I cry
I went out of my mind
In desert lands
Insanity's pawn
Out of control
Much too long I've been isolated
From my thoughts
Enclosed by the leader's spell
Bewildered to march
As a glory knight
And I tried
Still I hear the scream of thousands:
"Crucify, crucify!!!
Take it all
Our gold, our homes, our life,
But we didn't kill your Christ!!
Reach out for your holy grail
Enslave us and make us
Your god's sacrifice!!
Returning of the miracles
It's my own requiem
The jester's tears
They are inside me
Agony's the script for my requiem
Returning of the miracles
It's my own requiem
Is the script already written
Jester's tears I cry
Yes, I cry
Still I'm confused
If I was dreaming
Too late I realized
I'd been another fool
I pay the price,
I pay the price.
Returning of the miracles
It's my own requiem
The jester's tears
They are inside me
Agony's the script for my requiem
Returning of the miracles
It's my own requiem
Is the script already written
Jester's tears I cry
Mordred's Song
I've lost my battle before it starts
My first breath wasn't done
My spirit's sunken deep
Into the ground
Why am I alone
I can hear my heartbeat
Silence's all around
See hate will rise
So don't come closer
Fear your child
Born with a king's heart
But fate fooled me
And changed my cards
No one asked if I want it
If I liked it
Pain inside is rising
I am the fallen one
A figure in an old game
No Joker's on my side
I plunged into misery
I'll turn off the light
And murder the dawn
Turn off the light
And murder the dawn
Nothing else
But laughter is around me
Forevermore
No one can heal me
Nothing can save me
I've gone beyond the truth
It's just another lie
Wash away the blood on my hands
My father's blood
In agony we're unified
I never wanted to be
What they told me to be
Fulfill my fate than I'll be free
God knows how long
I tried to change fate
Pain inside is rising
I am the fallen one
A figure in an old game
No Joker's on my side
I plunged into misery
I'll turn off the light
And murder the dawn
Turn off the light
And murder the dawn
I plunged into misery
I'll turn off the light
And murder the dawn
Turn off the light
And murder the dawn!!
Born In A Morning Hall
In fact it was close to a real fallout
Everything's under control
The speaker said with a serious smile
Behind his mask
He knew the truth
I'll bring new age of better ways
The TV preacher said
Just pay today
Pay today
World's dressed in black
On earth's judgments day
And I?
I know it can't go on
Forbidden signs increase
I'm sitting still at home
And watching
Born in a mourning hall
Pale clouds of feared the unborn child
Then it grew up with growing plans
Of suicide
Born in a mourning hall
Shadows left the fear inside
The Peter Pan will never reach
The other side
It's frightening
Exciting to sit at home
And watch the burning fields get
Hypnotized by the TV snake
Obey and work hard
And feel no anger
Just sympathy for the higher class
There's no chance in changing
Things
Cause I am
Born in a mourning hall
Silent cries ran out
When the cradle breaks
Broken dreams were unheard on
The other side
Born in a mourning hall
Shadows left the fear
In the new born child
The Peter Pan will never reach
The other side
And I'm a part of a machine
A puppet on the strings
A rebel, once
Now I'm an old man
Oh, I know it can't go on
But the ghost called fear inside
Lames my tongue, my nerves,
My mind
Eternal fall down
Someone cut the strings off
I can't move
To get back courage
I've to face the truth
But not today
Goodbye
Born in a mourning hall
Caught inside a web called life
The only way to get out soon
I suicide
Born in a mourning hall
Pale souls built a frozen world
Infected brains
Will never reach the other side
The other side
Bright Eyes
Fool just another
Fool just another
I've been waiting
For signs of god
Create - enslave - behaved -
Everything is out of control
Leave me alone
Isolation bears hope
There's something else waiting
A promised destiny
Freezing me
I feel restless and low
These days full of sadness
Had joyfully changed
Into fear
My freakshow will start tonight
Don't miss the right time
Bright eyes
Blinded by fear of life
No Merlin is by my side
Everything is out of control
Everything is out of control
In my future plans
Everything is out of control
No one's left to hurt
Everything is out of control
Sorrow's gone away
Broken memories
Walking upstairs
Step by step
I see the whole world burning
The poet dies in Newerland
How it burns
Hey, mother stubborn
I really hate you
If you say yes I will say no
Ashes to ashes
But dust won't be dust
If you go there
I will go back
Bright eyes
Blinded by fear of life
Betrayed by sunrise
Bright eyes
Blinded by fear of life
No Merlin is by my side
Hey, father stubborn
You're ying
And I'm yang
I feel alone
Who really cares
Born into ashes
To lose all the games
With a smiling face
Bright eyes
Blinded by fear of life
And dark dragons rise
Bright eyes
Blinded by fear of life
No Merlin is by my side
So I sit still in my room, today
Winter's here
In summer season
Shall I say
I was wrong
If I'm right
Farewell to my last hope
Another Holy War
I am god
The only one
I will bring back
Freedom to your heart
You won't believe
That blind can't see
No one else before me ever knew
The way to paradise
For another bloody crime
I shall return
I am your light on through the night
Why am I born
Will I fail to rise again
Another Crucifixion for
Another holy war
Can't stop what's going on
Sooner or later you must understand
My words bring freedom
And rescue for man
What else,
To call me your Messiah
Oh, I wish there could be another way
Cross and nails are already prepared
My sell out
Waits till I'm crucified
I will die before my vision ends
Why am I born
Will I fail to rise again
Another Crucifixion for
Another holy war
Can't stop what's going on
Wait for the dawn
To take me away
What will be if I fail
Another golden calve
Never, never ending
Pain and agony
Hit me, nail me make me god
Why am I born
Will I fail to rise again
Another Crucifixion for
Another holy war
Can't stop what's going on
And The Story Ends
And the story ends
Insanity said coldly
Still waiting for the chance
So out of nowhere it will rise
Oh, and another journey starts
By the call of the moon
Was it really me
I saw in the mirror screaming
I swallowed hate and lies
Through a thousand cries
Someone's sucking out my energy
What can I do
On this road to nowhere
Heart of dragon lies
At the edge of time
And the story ends
Insanity said coldly
Still waiting for the chance
So out of nowhere it will rise
Oh, and another journey starts
Into insanity's claws
Come with me and join me
A new life's waiting for you
Jump through the mirror
Leave fear behind
No matter where I tried
The candle light seemed
Lost forever
Before my vision fades
-cathedral
-falling tears
We're not alone
There's someone else, too
From the mirror's other side
Reflecting the cruel part of your soul
It's time for your choice
What can I do
On this road to nowhere
Heart of dragon lies
At the edge of time
And the story ends
Insanity said coldly
Still waiting for the chance
So out of nowhere it will rise
Oh, and another journey starts
By the call of the moon
Heart of dragon lies
What can I do
On this road to nowhere
Heart of dragon lies
At the edge of time
And the story ends
Insanity said coldly
Still waiting for the chance
So out of nowhere it will rise
Oh, and another journey starts
Into sanity's claws
I'm not a king
I'm just a bard
How can I trust
If there is good and bad
The wounds of life
They will remain
At least I found a friend
War Of Wrath
The field is lost
Everything is lost
The black one has fallen from the sky and the towers in ruins lie
The enemy is within, everywhere
And with him the light, soon they will be here
Go now, my lord, while there is time
There are places below
And you know them too
I release thee, go
My servant you'll be for all time
As you command
My king
I had a part in everything
Twice I destroyed the light and twice I failed
I left ruin behind me when I returned
But I also carried ruin with me
She, the mistress of her own lust
Into The Storm
Give it to me
I must have it
Precious treasure
I deserve it
Where can I run
How can I hide
The Silmarils
Gems of treelight
Their life belongs to me
Oh it's sweet how the
Darkness is floating around
We are following
The will of the one
Through the dark age
And into the storm
And we are following
The will of the one
Through the dark age
And into the storm
Lord I'm mean
Blackheart show me
What you hold in your hand
I still hunger for more
Release me
From my pain
Give it to me
How I need it
How I need it
How I need it
I did my part
Now it's your turn
And remember
What you've promised
Lammoth
Nightfall
No sign of life did flicker
In floods of tears she cried
"All hope's lost it can't be undone
They're wasted and gone"
"Save me your speeches
I know (They blinded us all)
What you want
You will take it away from me
Take it and I know for sure
The light she once brought in
Is gone forevermore"
Like sorrowful seaguls they sang
"(We're) lost in the deep shades
The misty cloud brought
(A wailing when beauty was gone
Come take a look at the sky)
Monstrous it covered the shore
Fearful into the unknown"
Quietly it crept in new horror
Insanity reigned
And spilled the first blood
When the old king was slain
Nightfall
Quietly crept in and changed us all
Nightfall
Quietly crept in and changed us all
Nightfall
Immortal land lies down in agony
"How long shall we
Mourn in the dark
the bliss and the beauty
Will not return
Say farewell to sadness and grief
Though long and hard the road may be"
But even in silence I heard the words
"An oath we shall swear
By the name of the one
Until the world's end
It can't be broken"
Just wondering how
I can still hear these voices inside
The doom of the Noldor drew near
The words of a banished king
"I swear revenge"
Filled with anger aflamed our hearts
Full of hate full of pride
We screamed for revenge
"Vala he is that's what you said
Then your oath's been sworn in vain
(But) freely you came and
You freely shall depart
(So) never trust the northern winds
Never turn your back on friends"
"Oh I'm heir of the high lord!"
"You better don't trust him"
The enemy of mine
Isn't he of your kind and
Finally you may follow me
Farewell
He said
Back to where it all began
The Minstrel
So I stand still
In front of the crowd
Excited faces
Whar will be next?
I still don't have a clue
The Curse Of Fëanor
Taken the long way
Dark realms I went through
I arrived
My vision's so clear
In anger and pain
I left deep wounds behind
But I arrived
Truth might be changed by victory
Beyond the void but deep within me
A swamp of filth exists
A lake it was of crystal beauty
But Arda's spring went by
I've heard the warning
Well curse my name
I'll keep on laughing
No regret
No regret
Don't fear the eyes of the dark lord
Morgoth I cried
All hope is gone but I swear revenge
Hear my oath
I will take part in your damned fate
I will always remember their cries
Like a shadow which covers the light
I will always remember the time
But it's past
I cannot turn back the time
(I) don't look back
There's still smoke near the shore
But I arrived
Revenge be mine
I will take part in your damned fate
Morgoth I cried
It's my oath
So don't fear the eyes
Of the dark lord
Soon you will be free
Set your spirit free
"Suddenly I realized
The prophecies
I've never believed in
My deeds were wrong
I've stained the land
And slain my kin
(Burning Soul)
There's no release from my sins
It hurts
THE CURSE OF FËANOR RUNS LONG
Time and only time will tell us
Tell: was I right or wrong?
When anger breaks through
I'll leave mercy behind"
I will always remember their cries
Like a shadow they'll cover my life
But I'll also remember mine
(And) after all I'm still alive
Captured
You are now my guest, forever
Blood Tears
Welcome to my realm
We are both condemned to live
It's a dark fate
(I can hear your calls
I can hear your calls)
THE ETERNAL LIFE
I see it still burns
Each night I cry in pain
Alive
Though the end appears my friend
And blood tears I cry
You've searched and you've found
Cut off your old friends hand
My mind's
In frozen dreams
The rotten flesh
Of bitter lies
Welcome to where time stands still
Noone leaves and noone ever will
Can't hold it
It burns
Each night I cry in pain
And blood tears I cry
Endless grief remained inside
And blood tears I cry
Endless grief remained inside
It seems so clearly
Bent the bow
Cause life in me is gone
And a cruel wind's blowing cold
And a cruel wind's blowing cold
In blame
And life it shall wane
Each night I cry in pain
And blood tears I cry
Endless grief remained inside
Cut off your old friends hand
Mirror Mirror
Far, far beyond the island
We dwelt in shades of twilight
Through dread and weary days
Through grief and endless pain
It lies unknown
The land of mine
A hidden gate
To save us from the shadow fall
The lord of water spoke
In the silence
Words of wisdom
I've seen the end of all
Be aware the storm gets closer
Mirror Mirror on the wall
True hope lies beyond the coast
You're a damned kind can't you see
That the winds will change
Mirror Mirror on the wall
True hope lies beyond the coast
You're a damned kind can't you see
That tomorrows bears insanity
Gone's the wisdom
Of a thousand years
A world in fire and chains and fear
Leads me to a place so far
Deep down it lies my secret vision
I better keep it safe
Shall I leave my friends alone
Hidden in my twilight hall
(I) know the world is lost in fire
Sure there is no way to turn it
Back to the old days
Of bliss and cheerful laughter
We're lost in barren lands
Caught in the running flames
Alone
How shall we leave the lost road
Time's getting short so follow me
A leader's task so clearly
To find a path out of the dark
Mirror Mirror on the wall
True hope lies beyond the coast
You're a damned kind can't you see
That the winds will change
Mirror Mirror on the wall
True hope lies beyond the coast
You're a damned kind can't you see
That the winds will change
Even though
The storm calmed down
The bitter end
Is just a matter of time
Shall we dare the dragon
Merciless he's poisoning our hearts
Our hearts
How shall we leave the lost road
Time's getting short so follow me
A leader's task so clearly
To find a path out of the dark
Face The Truth
The moon, the sign of hope
It appeared when we left the pain of the ice-desert behind
We faced up to the curse and endured misery
Condemned we are
We brought hope, but also lies, and treachery
Noldor (Dead Winter Reigns)
Noldor
Blood is on your hands
Your bane's
A tearful destiny
Black clouds will carry
Rain of blood
I've seen it rain
We were lost
On grinding ice
In fear and hunger
Dead winter reigned
In Araman
(You) can't escape
From my damnation
(Nor) run away
From isolation
Guilty spoke the one
THis deed can't be undone
Hear my words
Fear my curse
I know where the stars glow
(And the) sky's unclouded
Sweet the water runs my friend
(But) Noldor
Blood is on your hands
Tears unnumbered
You will shet and dwell in pain
Your homeless souls
Shall come to me
There's no release
Slain you might be
Slain you will be
Slain you will be
And the lost
Who will not reach the
House of spirits
(Will) grow old and weary
I've seen this bitter end
As I've foreseen
The storm and ice
And I could see it
(How) a million died
And I?
The blame's on me
Cause I was not there
Dead winter reigns
And tomorrow's still unknown
Lies
Condemned and betrayed
Now everything is said
See my eyes
Are full of tears
And a cruel price
We've paid
But still I can't claim
That I'm innocent
Lost
Battle Of Sudden Flame
Oh lord here I stand
Suddely everything's gone
For all Noldor
From now on my life
Is my gift to you
Just lead my fate
To the victory
Of elves
Time Stands Still (At The Iron Hill)
Light fails at dawn
The moon is gone
And deadly the night reigns
Deceit
Finally I've found myself
In these lands
Horror and madness I've seen here
For what I became a king of the lost?
Barren and lifeless the land lies
Lord of all Noldor
A star in the night
And a bearer of hope
He rides into his glorious battle alone
Farewell to the valiant warlord
The Fate of us all
Lies deep in the dark
When time stands still at the iron hill
I stand alone
Noone's by my side
I'll dare you
Come out
You coward
Now it's me or you
He gleams like a star
And the sound of his horn's
Like a raging storm
Proudly the high lord
Challenges the doom
Lord of slaves he cries
Slowly in fear
The dark lord appears
Welcome to my lands
You shall be damned
The iron crowned
Is getting closer
Swings his hammer
Down on him
Like a thunderstorm
He's crushing
Down the Noldor's
Proudest king
Under my foot
So hopeless it seems
You've troubled my day
Now feel the pain
The Elvenking's broken
He stumbles and falls
The most proud and most valiant
His spirit survives
Praise our king
Praise our king
Praise our king
Praise our king
The Dark Elf
A dark seed of evil is grown
Thorn
A black swan
Is born that night
The misty pond
(Has) got a new king
Got a new king
So what can we do
With our lives
When it all begins
It's hard and
It's cruel
Will grace die in pain?
Will light ever rise again?
I'm trapped in darkness
Still I reach out for the stars
I'm moving in silence
I leave it all far behind
Oh at dawn
I'll face the edge of thorns
Oh at dawn
I'll pray at the edge of thorns
Oh at dawn
I'll face the edge of thorns
Let us march on
To the fields of sacrifice
(I'm) wondering why
I'll carry on
Will I betray myself
To rise
In the silence
It's time to explain
(And)
Search for truth in lies
Useful lies
Needless love's damned
What can we do with our lives
When it all begins
Come follow me
And you will see
How it will be
When all the pain is gone away
Let us march on
Though there's no hope at our side
Let us be brave
Though by glory we are denied
But
Don't you think
It's time for us
To bring to an end
Come play the song of death
The wisdom in us both
Will make it
Special guaranteed
Play the song of death
I'm lost in the depths of his eyes
I can't flee
Inner pain caused insanity
It's deep within
The fear and the hunger
Enslaved and denied
By my love and my enemies
I'm the illgotten son
The Eldar
I've seen the moon
And the first sunrise
I'll leave it to the memories
And kiss the wind goodbye
For the Eldar
I'm trapped inside this dream
Of the Eldar's
Song of doom
I've tasted poison
When I drank the wine of fate
But the fear was in my heart
I realized too late
The house of spirits call
For the Eldar
I'm trapped inside this dream
Of the Eldar's
Song of the doom
High's the fee
Soon my spirit will return
Welcome dawn
Your light will take me home
I say farewell
To the Eldar
I'm trapped inside this dream
Of the Eldar's
Song of doom
Nom The Wise
Thus he died
Nom the Wise
Lord of the caves and friend of man
Fair, and noble
Most beloved of the Noldor race
Paid the price, he redeemed the oath
Farewell my friend, farewell
When Sorrow Sang
So let me out of it
Out of the cold
To bring back light and hope for all
And so if I could get you in
Just for a little while
Into the songs of sorrow
You might understand
Where am I now
Beyond the dawn
(Where) hope's turned to dust
At all
Immortal love's
Fooled by the hands of doom
That love means death
I realized too soon
Caught in the afterlife
I've gone too far
When sorrow sang softly and sweet
The air was filled with tears
Full of sadness and grief
When sorrow sang softly and sweet
I feel like screaming
But I can't breath in
Shall I wane right now
I will not leave this
World of living
Till she has said
Goodbye
Out in the cold
I still wait for her call
And her last kiss
It shall be release
I can't forget her
Her face will not leave
From the depths of my soul
I long for her
So I heard all about it
Her voice's so clear
She's woven both themes in there
Moved me to tears
The world shall hear this sad song
Song of sorrow song of grief
Can't change the way of his kind
Can't change the way of her kind
Out On The Water
Out on the water
The island of the dead that live
There they dwelt
Until they left the world and
Still their deeds live forth in songs
The Steadfast
Now truly I am king of the world
Master of fate
Damned shall thy house be
Thou shall not question my power
Nor shall thou defy me further
A Dark Passage
I feel cold
Facing the darkness
The light's gone away
Deep in his castle he said
All land'll be mine
There's one thing for sure
The triumph of shadow is near
Deep in his castle they sang
We shall not rest
Until all will be thyne
All land is mine
You can be sure
Don't dare me
the mighty one screamed
Smashed down the light
I will not rest till I'm king
Valinor's empty now
allied the elves and men
they shall be damned
Rise of Fall
a dark tale ends
just wondering how
in the darkness
they found their way
to the right place
children of the sun
second kindred
we call their race
treat them kindly
born in the east
(are the) nightfearer
they moved westwards
towards the sunshine
(they are) morning breath like
short's their life
(like) dawn passes by
when the day comes
the field was lost
(and) hope had passed away
the sun went down
beyond the sea
dark was the hour
but day shall come again
Clean my wounds
wash away all fear
let courage be mine
noone hears me crying
no song no tale
which contains all the grief
(but)
renowned the deeds
and the victims of defeat
sit down on your chair
and look out for your kin
with my eyes you'll see
and with my ears you'll hear
you troubled my day
and you've questioned my strength
(but) don't mess
with the master of fate
I smashed down the light
and dared Valinor
I smashed down the light
revenge will be mine
Slowly marching on
still we're marching on
Final Chapter (Thus Ends...)
Thus ends the fifth battle
By the treachery of men the field is lost
The night falls and great is the triumph of evil
The league is broken
The last vestige of hope lives in the hidden king
Only he troubles the dark one's mind
Only he could bring ruin to the black foe
Though the land lies down in agony and the curse lives on
A new star shall arise
And a new day shall come, again

BLIND GUARDIAN LYRICS
Don't Talk To Strangers
Don't talk to strangers
'cause they're only there to do you harm
Don't write in starlight
'cause the words may come out real
Don't hide in doorways
You may find the key that opens up your soul
Don't go to heaven 'cause it's really only hell
Don't smell the flowers
They're an evil drug to make you lose your mind
Don't dream of women
'cause they'll only bring you down
Hey you, you know me
You've touched me, but I'm real
I'm forever the one who lets you look and see
Can You feel me? I'm danger - I'm a stranger
And I
I'm darkness, I'm anger, I'm pain
I am the master
The evil song you sing inside your brain, drive you insane
Don't talk
Don't let them inside your mind yeah
Run away, run away go
Don't let them in your mind, touch your soul
Don't dance in darkness
You may stumble and you're sure to fall
Don't write in starlight
'cause the words may come out real
Don't talk to strangers
'cause they're only there to make you sad
Don't dream of women
'cause they'll only bring you down
Run away
Precious Jerusalem
No doubt, doubt
No longer need to hide it
I've found out who I am
I'm moved around in circles
I rise and fall again
I know it well
Every word I tell
Seems to make no sense at all
Words
Will heal it
Love
Will conquer the
Hearts of the hopeless the almighty is still alive
Risin' up from the heart of the desert
Risin' up from Jerusalem
Risin' up from the heat of the desert
Building up old Jerusalem
Risin' up from the heart of the desert
Risin' up from Jerusalem
Risin' up from the heat of the desert
Heading out for Jerusalem
I've gone beyond but there's no life
And there is nothing how it seems
I've gone beyond but there's no life
There is no healing rain in Eden
The empty barren wasted paradise
Let's celebrate the dawning of the Sun
I turn to you oh my precious Jerusalem
Deny your prophets their passion and treat them like fools
I turn to you oh my poor old Jerusalem
Deny my love but you can't change fate
Son of man
(You truly are mine)
Can't stand the pain
No more grief and misery
It goes on and on and on and on and on and on and on
Father stop it now
We must stop it now
You really think you are half way up
I would not mind if you were right
(It's not sure)
I'd rather say you are half way down
So I am going to help you if I can
I've been caught in wilderness in wilderness
I've get out well
I found myself in desert lands in desert lands
But you've been on my mind
I turn to you oh my precious Jerusalem
Deny your prophets their passion and treat them like fools
I turn to you oh my poor old Jerusalem
Deny my love but you can't change truth
Rise up and follow me cause I will bring the light
Rise up and follow me wake up and clear your mind
I try to bring it back the seed of life
I try to bring it back the seal of light
So if you say there's no faith in man
You better keep in mind
That I can read between the lines
My heavy burden brings eyesight to the blind
I've been caught in wilderness in wilderness
I've get out well
I found myself in desert lands in desert lands
But you've been on my mind
I turn to you oh my precious Jerusalem
Deny your prophets their passion and treat them like fools
I turn to you oh my poor old Jerusalem
Deny my love but you can't change me
Battlefield
It cannot be seen but there's blood on the green
Only God knows I'm innocent
Take me, take me home
A dark seed reigns in me like the Storm rules over the sea
I challenge thee, do not cross this bridge alone
Don't dare me now
The threatening shadows will pass by
They're getting closer now
Open your eyes
Wake up my dear young friend
And hate shall fade away
I will not move, yet
I'll stand still instead
There on the battlefield he stands
Down on the battlefield he's lost
And on the battlefield it ends
War and anger shall reign
The clash of iron can be heard
By blindness you're driven insane
I'm lost in anguish and grief
Sorrow won't wane 'til you die
A shattered body deeply hurt
And darkness will cover the light
It's gone forevermore
The field's been left in sorrow
The father and the son they're gone
The Sun shines bright and anger rises
Lorn and lonely torn apart
Don't you think it's time to stop now
We were charmed and fooled by the old serpent's kiss
Let's pray that heaven is on our side
Through violence and horror shall honour arise
So let's pray and blessed shall be our leader
We follow the noble and bright
Don't you hear me crying, crying
Come take me away
I hallow thy name
There on the battlefield he stands
Down on the battlefield he's lost
And on the battlefield it ends
War and anger shall reign
The clash of iron can be heard
By blindness you're driven insane
I'm lost in anguish and grief
Sorrow won't wane 'til you die
A shattered body deeply hurt
And darkness will cover the light
It's gone forevermore
That's what the minstrel sing
Join in the horrible screams
Take part in murderous deeds
Renowned be the lion-hearted
Join in the minstrelsy
Wailing in endless grief
It eagerly longs for more
Broken bodies lay down on the ground
Blood sheds all over the place
The green will be stained forever
And hate reigns all over the field
They keep struggling on in anger
Fiercely intense outrageous, too blind to see
And in pain they keep on singing
We claim the land for the highlord
God bless the land and our highlord
War and anger shall reign
The clash of iron can be heard
By blindness you're driven insane
I'm lost in anguish and grief
Sorrow won't wane 'til you die
A shattered body deeply hurt
And darkness will cover the light
It's gone forevermore
Under The Ice
Run
'Til you find the answer
Time out
For our poor Cassandra
She's fairly safe inside the fire
Inside the fire
Awakes desire
Cruelly admired
They'll torture her soul
And they'll torment her heart
But won't change her mind
Would you like to see me
How I'll cut off
Her head life's a game
A lesson to learn
Don't be shy just blame me
Well, there is no
Need to feel ashamed
Remember the oath
Remember the oath
Wake up
It's time to cross the border
Is it true what they say
About the part you've played?
Enjoy your stay here
Welcome to the slaughterhouse
Release from rotten thoughts
No more pain
And no more gods
Under the ice you will believe
Under the ice you will be free
Released from rotten thoughts
No more pain
And no more gods
Please understand
It's not in our hands
Barren the land
It's all dead and gone
And still the tyrant's face is red
So witness my glory, my triumph, my fame
It's the sweetest taste
King of terror just stop wining
Hold your breath it won't take long
Realize this is your judgement day
In between the killing carry on
There are no rules here
Welcome to the slaughterhouse
Release from rotten thoughts
No more pain
And no more gods
Under the ice you will believe
Under the ice you will be free
Released from rotten thoughts
No more pain
And no more gods
Try to understand
You're the artificial enemy
An illusion we all need
For our sake
For our sake
We're not allowed to see beyond that's your skill
Will we ever learn the lesson "We can't fly with broken wings"
Break the chains
Time to change
I'm afraid to say but you won't play a part
It's been nice we now get to the climax
Your destination's unknown
Just get out of my way
Don't mind the blood here
Welcome to the slaughterhouse
Release from rotten thoughts
No more pain
And no more gods
Under the ice you will believe
Under the ice you will be free
Released from rotten thoughts
No more pain
And no more gods
Under the ice you will be free
Released from rotten thoughts
No more pain
And no more gods
And no more gods
(No more gods)
I'm afraid to say but you won't play a part
Sadly Sings Destiny
A wooden cup and a crown of thorns
Will set up the stage for the cross
I rent a room next door
There is nothing more
No further voices to hear
I'll be free
It doesn't matter anymore that someone's knocking at my door
I've known it long before the Galilean's on the floor
Shame on me, shame on me
I'm a tool and nothing more
I can feel it's getting nearer
Images they'll turn out clearer
Creeps in and out of your mind
I'm destiny personified
I know there's something more behind
But is it really justified
To sacrifice, to crucify
The rescue of the human kind
Sadly sings destiny
Sadly sings destiny
"For ages I've been waiting
Now spring is in the air
Let it in"
Sadly sings destiny
Sadly sings destiny
"For ages I've been waiting
Now spring is in the air
Let it in"
I hear them howling hear them scream
The raging mob turns mad it seems
"The king's in town
We need a crown"
I think we all know how it ends
"So we're not going take it longer"
So all I know is I don't care
"So we're not going take it longer"
Now we are aware
I can feel it's getting nearer
Images they'll turn out clearer
Creeps in and out of your mind
I'm destiny personified
I know there's something more behind
But is it really justified
To sacrifice, to crucify
The rescue of the human kind
Sadly sings destiny
Sadly sings destiny
"For ages I've been waiting
Now spring is in the air
Let it in"
Sadly sings destiny
Sadly sings destiny
"For ages I've been waiting
Now spring is in the air
Let it in"
There I tie the ass
There I tie the colt
Begging for a last chance I hear the voices say
"We get him home tonight and that's all you need to know"
I'm alone
So I can't stand it any longer
And don't want to see it all
Nazarene, your vision will come true
Will come true
They'll get you
I can feel it's getting nearer
Images they'll turn out clearer
Creeps in and out of your mind
I'm destiny personified
I know there's something more behind
But is it really justified
To sacrifice, to crucify
The rescue of the human kind
Sadly sings destiny
Sadly sings destiny
"For ages I've been waiting
Now spring is in the air
Let it in"
Sadly sings destiny
Sadly sings destiny
"For ages I've been waiting
Now spring is in the air
Let it in"
The Maiden And The Minstrel Knight
The faithful crowd is gathered here
Soon they'll appear
The high and mighty show up the king
Is in doubts
"Apart from this beggar here
There's no one like you my dear
Tasting my lips
No one but you and him"
Round the fire everyone should sing
And praise the gracious queen
Round the fire everyone should dance
And we praise the handsome knight
Forever and ever we both will be one
The maiden, the fair and the young
Fell in love
Will you still wait for me?
Will you still cry for me?
Come and take my hand
Will you still wait for me?
Will you still cry for me?
Come and take my hand
There's a moment in life when all the years will pass by
And the eyes filled with tears we once shed
We recognize failures, the desperate cries
Of the ones who believed in our lies
Whenever I'll go you'll be with me
My first though and my last
Though we'll depart in bitterness
One day you'll understand
Carry on
Beloved maiden, mine
Carry on
Or we have to pay the price
Will you still wait for me?
Will you still cry for me?
Come and take my hand
Will you still wait for me?
Will you still cry for me?
Come and take my hand
Yesterday's memories and melodies
Are gone with the wind, so sad
Snow-white her hands and golden her hair
But she's not the one
Out in the emptiness where everything's pale
There is no sign of you, I'm alone
How I wish you would be here, I'm alone
Telling me it's alright, come rest (your head)
Come rest your head
Come rest your head
Come rest your head
Come rest your head
I'm alone and sadness reigns in my heart
As long as we live it won't go away
We are one but torn apart
Will you still wait for me?
Will you still cry for me?
Come and take my hand
Will you still wait for me?
Will you still cry for me?
Come and take my hand
Proudly it stands
Until the world's end
The victorious banner of love
Wait For An Answer
I cannot say that I don't care cause I'm aware
Of everyone and everything they're everywhere
Don't be a fool
Stop spinning around
(Spinning around)
You're right it ain't safe here
Start using your brain, your brain
The cautious hare cannot be seen as a coward
He's simply aware
(He constantly) knows what's going on
That the wheel of life turns on
It won't hold on
Silent creature, filthy teacher's
Spreading the disease, a release
A vanished kingdom falls
It goes on, on and on and again
It goes on, round and round
Oh I can't get it out of my head
Wish I'd be a bird of prey
A pure and a blessed
A hawk who could ease the pain
Don't look back tell me
Is it where you belong
A place in the dark
A song without hope
Don't look back tell me
Is it where you (belong)
Oh I wait for an answer so far
Don't look back tell me
Is it where you (belong)
I will wait for an answer so far
Don't look back tell me
Is it where you (belong)
I will wait yes I will wait
Don't look back
We're the last descendants
In the line of valiant soldiers
We're mistreated angels
We are the blackbird nation, we're the chosen ones
We're the last descendants
We're the tribe of unsung glory
We are the fallen angels
Well the time is right you shall be on my (side)
I don't I don't I don't need anyone
Be with or be against me
I'm white I am chosen
There is not the slightest doubt at all
Not at all
In lower airs we're ground down by their ignorance
Hate will grow like a foul cancer
To find a foe seems to be the answer
Round and round it goes on and again oh
I can't get it out of my head
Wish I'd be a bird of prey
A pure and a blessed
A hawk who could ease the pain
Don't look back tell me
Is it where you belong
A place in the dark
A song without hope
Don't look back tell me
Is it where you (belong)
Oh I wait for an answer so far
Don't look back tell me
Is it where you (belong)
I will wait for an answer so far
Don't look back tell me
Is it where you (belong)
I will wait yes I will wait
Don't look back
Don't be a fool
Stop spinning around
(Spinning around)
Don't move it ain't safe here
They've stained holy grounds
Oh no
The hopeful he sadly admits there's no hero
No place to hide there is no shelter from the storm
The maddened crow will spread terror
But I know bitterly they will stumble
Find themselves smashed on the ground
Don't look back tell me
Is it where you belong
A place in the dark
A song without hope
Don't look back tell me
Is it where you (belong)
Oh I wait for an answer so far
Don't look back tell me
Is it where you (belong)
I will wait for an answer so far
Don't look back tell me
Is it where you (belong)
I will wait yes I will wait
Don't look back
It's you who has said there's no tomorrow
I don't know but who I am
I wouldn't sit back any longer
It's surely built in sadness
But the sadness surely will go by
So we will all know the answer
The answer's within, it's in your mind
The Soulforged
I'm not insane
That's how it seems though
Spiteful, cruel but wise beyond his age
My body fails
My soul will (rise)
The end of life's immortalized
Disease and agony
And I see death through golden eyes
(Beyond the door)
There's something more
It seems there's just one way
On through the heat
I've felt the touch of evil
I still feel
The icy claw in me
For a descent price I've banned kindness from my heart
The spirit of all truth and beauty pawned for my desire
And from the flames
As chance would have it
The Soulforged will come into light
And from the flames
As chance would have it
The Soulforged, the stainless will rise
I will never change my mind
I will leave it all behind
And through the hour glass
Everything's grey, everyone's pale
Nor colour nor beauty will enlighten my heart
The seat of life's empty and cold
Cadaverous you all seem to me
Stillborn but you're still alive
You're still alive
Truth lies in loneliness
When hope is long gone by
I'll wipe out the bliss of the new age
And welcome you precious night
And from the flames
As chance would have it
The Soulforged will come into light
And from the flames
As chance would have it
The Soulforged, the stainless will rise
>From a distant time voices echo in the hall
"Come and join us, enter life and everything is gone now"
And through the looking glass
I still fear mortality and
Its loss in the end
(Unlimited) power in my hands
("Mourn for his lost soul
He's cursed and condemned")
The claw of the dragon ascends
Each step I take mMay it hurt may It ache
Leads me further away from the past
But as long as I breathe (and) each smile on my bleak face
I'm on my way to find back to the Peace of mind
And from the flames
As chance would have it
The Soulforged will come into light
And from the flames
As chance would have it
The Soulforged, the stainless will rise
I will never change my mind
I will leave it all behind
Age Of False Innocence
Cut off the light, take a look
There's nothing beyond but pain
Suffer in the deepest void
The flame of hope is gone
What have I done?
Denied the father and the son
For a moment it seemed
There's space beyond the spheres
Aflame the night
So clear and bright
Unstable light
(You've been sacrificed in fear)
Now there's one thing for sure
I'm not afraid anymore
Day after day we've been fixed in this bowl for so long
For ages we're captured in shells and crystallized walls
Predestined or punished? By Man or God?
I cannot, I will not
Deny It's false innocence
I cannot, I will not
The age of false innocence
(Take it away from me)
(And) for a while astronomy has moved the Earth
And we've turned around the Sun
(Sanctum Officium)
Has made me believe
Has made me believe
Has made me believe
"We know for sure you're lying
Would you like to mess with holy science
You know the fear of dying
Would it be worth it to hear you crying"
I've slaughtered truth and I've shattered my heart
Far too long I have played with hellfire
And science has turned into madness
But I should have taken it higher
So I feel, so I feel
Like Judas must have felt before
That Wednesday night near by the tree
I cannot, I will not
Deny It's false innocence
I cannot, I will not
The age of false innocence
(Take It away from me)
Day after day we will gratefully suffer for more
Predestined's our part so we bleed in the name of God
Don't believe in their eternity
We're still held in blindness
And I've been turned into a liar
If there is no heaven there won't be release
I cannot, I will not
Deny It's false innocence
(I cannot) I will not
The age of false innocence
(I cannot) I will not
Deny It's false innocence
(I cannot) I will not
The age of false innocence
(Take It away from me)
Punishment Divine
It's warm and tender but very soon it will turn cold
Shadows stare down from the walls
Out of the mist it's coming closer now
It never rains -- it pours on me
So let the saints
Set up the courtyard, the unpleasant cage
The obvious point is I'm insane
Was I aware whom I has slain, I fear I was:
The faceless
The nameless
The bush set on fire
No one ever dared to speak
"Shame on me, I don't believe
The here and now Is all we're living for"
Joyful it seems but
Then suddenly
By one false move it's blown away
Joyful it seems but
Then suddenly
Their voices cease it's gone away
Vanished to the point of no return
Vanished to the point of no return
Witness my last breath
I do not regret
A word I've said
The strong will survive
The weak must die
And out of the mist
It's coming closer now
Sinner and saints --
The grateful slaves
Nature's law instead of God in heaven
From far beyond
I can hear them sing
I hear angels sing
Songs of innocence
I hear the angel sing
Despite the facts are clear
It cannot be, what we can't see
I must admit, it sounds so sweet
Joyful it seems but
Then suddenly
By one false move it's blown away
Joyful it seems but
Then suddenly
Their voices cease it's gone away
Vanished to the point of no return
Vanished to the point of no return
Angels sing
(Can hear them sing)
I hear angels sing
I hear angels sing
(Can hear them sing)
I hear angels sing
I hear angels sing
(Can hear them sing)
I hear angels sing
I hear angels sing
I hear angels sing
Far beyond I hear them sing
("It's true) it's true
We don't exist"
From far beyond I hear them sing
("It's true) it's true
We don't exist"
Well we all know there's no other side
It's good and evil
I know right between, there's no borderline
This is the punishment divine
Surrounded by night, I've been offered insight
There is none but the sin of pride
Am I wrong am I right? Am I losing my sight?
Abandoning the superior mind
Joyful it seems but
Then suddenly
By one false move it's blown away
Joyful it seems but
Then suddenly
Their voices cease it's gone away
Vanished to the point of no return
Vanished to the point of no return
(Right away)
Through the valleys grey
(I will be gone)
Through the shapeless land I walk alone
(I will be gone)
I'm left alone
(I will be gone)
Through the deepest void, a blackened paradise
(I will be gone)
I walk alone, I'm left alone
And Then There Was Silence
Turn your head and see the fields of flames
(Don't move along)
He carries along
(Cause things they will go wrong)
>From a distant place
(The end is getting closer)
He's on his way
(Day by day)
He'll bring decay
In shades of grey
We're doomed to face the night
Light's out of sight
Since we've reached the point of no return
We pray for the starlight we wait for the Moon
The sky is empty, alone in the unknown
we're getting nowhere
We have been betrayed by the wind and the rain
The sacred hall's empty and cold
The sacrifice made should not be done in vain
Revenge will be taken by Rome
We live a lie
Under the dying moon
Pale-faced laughs doom
Indulges in delight
It's getting out of hand
The final curtain will fall
Hear my voice
There is no choice
There's no way out
You'll find out
We don't regret it
So many men have failed but now he's (gone)
Go out and get it
The madman's head it shall be thine
We don't regret it
That someone else dies hidden in (disguise)
Go out and get it
Orion's hound shines bright
Don't you think it's time to stop the chase
Around the ring
Just stop running, running
Round the ring
Don't you know that fate has been decided
By the gods
Feel the distance, distance
Out of reach
Welcome to the end
Watch your step, Cassandra, you may fall
As I've stumbled on the field
Find myself in darkest places
(Sister mine)
Find myself drifting away
(Death's a certain thing)
And the other world
The other world appears
Find myself she dies in vain
I cannot be freed, I'm falling down
As time runs faster, moves towards disaster
The ferryman will wait for you, my dear
And then there was silence
Just a voice from the other world
Like a leaf in an icy world
Memories will fade
Misty tales and Poems lost
All the bliss and beauty
Will be gone
Will my weary soul find release for a while
At the moment of death I will smile
It's the triumph of shame and disease
In the end (Iliad)
Raise my hands and praise the day
Break the spell show me the (way)
In decay
The flame of Troy will shine bright
The newborn child will carry ruin to the hall
The newborn's death would be a blessing to us all
Good choice?
Bad choice?
Out of three you've chosen misery
Power and wisdom you deny
(Bad choice, bad choice)
War is the only answer when Love will conquer fear
So the judgement's been made
To the fairest the graceful says
Badly he fails
(Warning)
Fear the heat of passion, father king
(Don't let him in
Don't let her in)
Desire, lust, obsession
Death they'll bring
(We can't get out
Once they are in)
She's like the sunrise
Outshines the Moon at night
Precious like starlight
She will bring in a murderous price
(In darkness grows the seed of man's defeat)
Jealousy
(I can clearly see the end now)
I can clearly see the end now
I can clearly see the end now
(The thread of life is spun)
The coin's been placed below my tongue
Never give up
Never give in
Be on our side so we can win
Never give up
Never give in
Be on out side
(Old moon's time) is soon to come
Nowhere to run
Nowhere to hide
Nothing to lose like one we'll stand
We'll face the storm
Created by a man
Roar Roar Roar Roar
Troy (Troy Troy Troy)
And as the lion slaughters man
I am the wolf and you're the lamb
(Hallowed) Troy will fall round the walls
Faith is shattered, bodies fall
Nowhere to run
Nowhere to hide
Nothing to lose like one we'll stand
It's all for one and one for all
We live for will be wiped out
I feel that something's (wrong)
Surprise, surprise they're gone
Full moon your time goes by
And new moon's still kept out of sight
We live
Misty tales and Poems lost
(We die)
All the bliss and beauty will be gone
Will my weary soul find release for a while
At the moment of death I will smile
It's the triumph of shame and disease
In the end (Iliad)
Raise my hands and praise the day
Break the spell show me the (way)
In decay
The flame of Troy will shine bright
Roam in darkness
(Spread the vision)
Roam in darkness
(Spread the vision)
Roam in darkness
(Spread the vision)
Roam in darkness
(Spread the vision)
(Roam in darkness)
(We will be lost if you truly believe)
(Roam in darkness)
Troy in darkness
(There's a cold emptiness in our hearts)
That they've gone away
(And) won't come back
They'll tear down the wall to bring it in
They'll truly believe in the lie
Lie, lie
With blossoms they'll welcome the old foe
The vision's so clear
When day and dream unite the end is near
You better be prepared
The nightmare shall be over now, there's nothing more to fear
Come join in our singing and dance with us now
The nightmare shall be over now, there's nothing more to fear
The war it is over forevermore
No hope
The blind leads the blind
Carry on
Though future's denied
Mare or stallion
There's far more inside
We are in at the kill we'll cheerfully die
Misty tales and Poems lost
All the bliss and beauty
Will be gone
(Will) my weary soul find release for a while
At the moment of death I will smile
It's the triumph of shame and disease
In the end (Iliad)
Raise my hands and praise the day
Break the spell show me the (way)
In decay
The flame of Troy will shine bright
Holy light shines on
So the judgement's been made
We're condemned though the trial's far ahead
The crack of doom, Father
Your handsome son is heading home
Still the wind blows, calm and silent
Carries news from a distant shore
Still the wind blows, calm and silent
Carries news from a distant shore
Still the wind blows, calm and silent
(Out of mind)
Carries news from a distant shore
(Can't get it)
(Still the wind blows, calm and silent)
(Out of mind)
(Carries news from a distant shore)
(Can't get it out of my head)
(Can't get it)
(Out of mind)
(Can't get it out of my head)
Sorrow and defeat
Sorrow and defeat
Mies Del Dolor
Ella partió
Y el bosque durmió  
La doncella nunca volverá  
El sello del olvido se ha roto  
Y en pecado un amor tornará  
Nuestra vida sola baila  
Esperanza gritos cubrirá  
La verdad en el pasado  
Sueños mentiras mostrarán  
La noche vendrá  
Dolor quedará  
De repente todo se aclaró  
La venda de los ojos cayó  
Sus ojos cerró  
Y mi nombre gritó  
Ella nunca nunca mas fue vuelta  
A ver  
Mies del dolor  
Tu fruto creció  
En helada tierra de pesar  
Cuando muera la luz  
La noche invernal  
Vendrá  
Ella partió  
Y yo pierdo la fe  
Mis heridas no podrán sanar  
Traeré al ocaso  
Pese a que seré burlado yo  
Por la vida y el juicio final  
Amanece en la vida y sé  
Que pronto todo pasará  
Y enfrento las sombras de pie en soledad  
Mies del dolor  
Tu fruto creció  
En helada tierra de pesar  
Cuando muera la luz  
La noche invernal  
Vendrá
Harvest Of Sorrow
She is gone leaves are falling down
The tear maiden will not return
The seal of oblivion is broken
And a pure love's been turned into sin
At the dawn of our living time
Hope may cover all cries
Truth lurks hidden in the shadows
Dreams might be filled with lies
Soon there will be night
Pain remains inside
Suddenly (oh) it seemed so clear
All the blindness was taken away
She closed her eyes and she called out my name
She was never ever never ever seen again
Harvest of sorrow, your seed is grown
In a frozen world full of cries
When the ray of light shrinks
Shall cold winter nights begin
She is gone and I fall from grace
No healing charm covers my wounds
Fooled's the dawn and so I am
Fooled by life and a bitter doom
To bring you the end of the day
At the dawn of our living time
Hope it soon will pass by
Facing a darkness
I stand (alone)
Harvest of sorrow, your seed is grown
In a frozen world full of cries
When the ray of light shrinks
Shall cold winter nights begin
Another Stranger Me
A seed of doubt
It exists
And it grows
A glimpse of life
From somewhere deep within
Awake and understand
Is there anyone else here?
Somebody's screaming
Please help me
Let's find out now
That I am not dreaming
Welcome to my damnation
Here it comes the real me
I didn't know
I couldn't hear the answer
My mind was blank
I should've known
I hold it back but somehow
There is someone else
Another stranger me
Another stranger me
That's
When the ice
Will break away
I can't get out of here
Anymore
Cause none of my keys
Fit the door
There's fear and anger
Hate and love
I must confess
It's out of hand
It's physic
It's cynic
Still cynic
All my laughter
It's cynic
Just manic
It's cynic
All her laughter
If there's anyone in
It soon will be over
We'll burn out
Our soul's aflamed
And we're on our own now
Give up you cruel invasion
You're insane I'll show you
I didn't know
I couldn't hear the answer
My mind was blank
I should've known
I hold it back but somehow
There is someone else
Another stranger me
Another stranger me
Out and gone
Can't resist
Cold and sore
The bolt of pain
Keeps ripping through my head
I can take no more
Don't tell anyone else but I
Do not believe her
She hates me
I cloud my mind
She's a deceiver
I can feel cruel vibrations
Would you like to meet me
I didn't know
I couldn't hear the answer
My mind was blank
I should've known
I hold it back but somehow
There is someone else
Another stranger me
Another stranger me
All The King's Horses
I can feel I'm one
With the tortured land
With its solitude and decay
There's no one left
All the other men
Pass on through the night
All dead and gone
Still I don't dare to move
The imprisoned soul
Cannot find back home
Snow falls down
It covers field and blood
Snow falls down
And clears the view
It is cold
And once again
The battle's fought
Out on the plains
So rhymes spread out its glory
But
No rhyme defines its pain
I can't recall all their names
Connection broke loose
They've crossed the lake
Reach the other side
And leave me alone
With the truth
All the king's horses
And all the king's men
They've failed to damn the flood
They've failed to find the grail
Talisien, old friend of mine
Sing my song
Then once again
The battle's lost
I am to blame
Snow falls down
All dead and gone
They all are dead and gone
They've turned to dust
They've sealed the past
A long long time ago
I can't recall all their names
Connection broke loose
They've crossed the lake
Reach the other side
And leave me alone
With the truth
I can't recall all their names
Connection broke loose
They've crossed the lake
Reach the other side
And leave me alone
With the truth
Dream A Little Dream Of Me
Stars shining bright above you
Night breezes seem to whisper "i love you"
Birds singin' in the sycamore trees
Dream a little dream of me
Say nighty-night and kiss me
Just hold me tight and tell me you'll miss me
While I'm alone and blue as can be
Dream a little dream of me
Stars fading but I linger on dear
Still craving your kiss
I'm longin' to linger till dawn dear
Just saying this
Sweet dreams till sunbeams find you
Sweet dreams that leave all worries behind you
But in your dreams whatever they be
Dream a little dream of me
Stars shining up above you
Night breezes seem to whisper "i love you"
Birds singin' in the sycamore trees
Dream a little dream of me
Sweet dreams till sunbeams find you
Sweet dreams that leave all worries behind you
But in your dreams whatever they be
Dream a little dream of me
Yes, dream a little dream of me
Lionheart (Demo Version)
Just let me out of here
Speak to me
It all would be easier
I want to talk to you
Who is that?
Do I hear a whisper?
Or do I hear a cry?
Across the brown land
The stumps of time
Oh turn the wheel and heal me
Since moonlights fade
I'm empty - heal me
I'm in search of the Lionheart
I am ashamed
I myself can't make it
Drown Ulysses
Drown here in the silence
Cause down to Hades I've gone
But I cannot get out
Down below
I can't free my mind
Soon I will fade away
Down below
I can't free my mind
Soon I will fade
"Tic Tac" is the message
And the lunatic fears
He is no more
Speak to me
It all would be easier
While I'm passing by
What's that?
Do I hear a whisper?
Or do I hear a cry?
Across the brown land
The ghost arrives
Pick up my bones and
Tell me
Is this the "Lake of Fire"?
Hell?
Please
I'm in search of the Lionheart
Nobody else
But the pure can save me
Drown Ulysses
Drown here in the silence
Cause down to Hades I've gone
But I cannot get out
Ruins rule my memories
I can't recall the signs
Invite the dead
Then silence struck my mind
Silence is madness
"Tic Tac Tic Tactic"
Says the clock
Just let me out of here
Speak to me
It all would be easier
I want to talk to you
Hear me
Welcome to this sad place
And hand me what is mine
I'm the Theban prophet
The dead and blind
And from the sea you'll feel me
Then you'll breath out gently
Leave me
I'm in search of the Lionheart
I am ashamed
I myself can't make it
Drown Ulysses
Drown here in the silence
Cause down to Hades I've gone
But I cannot get out
The Edge (Demo Version)
The world turned innocent
Can you hear me?
I confess I'm no redeemer
Can you hear me?
What shall I do?
I witnessed everything
Faith won't leave me
Mind my tongue
It's like a fire
Faith don't leave me
Glow into words
This is the edge now
It's all we're living for
Rain on me
Love you will rain on me
And at the end I
Boast in the cross
And now
Love reigns -
The god incarnation
I've shaped
Out there is a world on fire
Accursed the hanged one
Divine love for free
What a fateful night
And a grateful life
The choir echoes
"Every man his price"
Price
Light my agony
And crucify me
Void the law
At the ninth hour
Void the law
At the ninth hour
This is the edge now
It's all we're living for
Rain on me
Love you will rain on me
And at the end I
Boast in the cross
And now
Love reigns -
The god incarnation
I've shaped
The world turns flesh again
Mystified are the final hours
No more fear in
No more fear in
Passover
The brook
Time it is at hand
Obscure the facts
A passion play
This is the edge now
It's all we're living for
Rain on me
Love you will rain on me
And at the end I
Boast in the cross
And now
Love reigns -
The god incarnation
I've shaped
Hallowed be thy name
Hallowed be thy name
No more fear in ...
Come take a look
The old symbols they move
Wounds still bleed
That's creed
No more fear in ...
Can you see me?
Come take a look
At the depth of my soul
This Will Never End
Once upon a time
No more words to say
Find me in the circle
Find me in the end
I am the soul collector
Dressed in ebony,
There are no rules
But only one
There's someone young sister,
Caught in the border
Let's get in contact
By the laws of mine
I have told
That this will never end (this will never end)
Things go on
But nothing will last,
Only the fool in me believes
There is sense in it.
In distant shores of grief
It's over now!
Far out in space
I ride on,
Time is chasing us all,
It's not quite how it seems,
It's just a dream.
I don't believe
In a soul out of god
It's just twisted!
Fellow
You do not understand.
Each single breath inspires
you to come to an end - expire.
Rise up my sister
Let's cross the border,
Reveal the secret
One more soul to burn
I have told
That this will never end (this will never end)
Things go on
But nothing will last,
Only the fool in me believes
There is sense in it.
In distant shores of grief
It's over now!
Something I'm close to,
something left to do
Draw near and prove yourself for brightening
Prepare yourself, don't wait for me,
Expect the day when I come
You have reached out for a while,
You may feel (down),
There's a wreck there, don't turn your eyes
Don't visions bleak,
And its colour's black,
Oh far beyond there is a star in dying sun
I have told
That this will never end (this will never end)
Things go on
But nothing will last,
Only the fool in me believes
There is sense in it.
In distant shores of grief
It's over now!
Otherland
They rule the land
They're in command
They hold all the strings in hand
They are invisible
Out of sight
They've designed
A secret place
To play their games
A world, they're in control
Divine law
Divine law
Be aware
Now
Mind your steps
We are uninvited guests,
They may find and catch us
Don't forget
Do what I say
Now connect
Don't even ask
Until we're out of it
Everything's at highest stake
Come take a look
We are in
Take a breath
But don't forget
It isn't real
It isn't true
An illusion
Nothing more
You're a part of the game
You're a slave to the grind
Oblivion
Is your key to the Otherland
You're a part of the game
You're cursed
You're damned
By now you understand
You're a part of the game
You're a slave to the grind
Oblivion
You're welcome to the Otherland
You're a part of the game
You're cursed
You're damned
By now you understand
We get closer
There's no better way
Lullaby Lane
Fade is on its way
The inner district
Is the place you need to know
It's overwhelming
So let's rest here for a while
Someone else appears
Silently
Watch me when I fall down
Everything seems real
Suddenly
Perfect simulation
Come take a look
Breathe it in
Artificial wonderlands
We are wandering around
Things shall vanish
They won't last
Now I know
You understand
This world is not true
Nothing is real
Nothing at all
It's bits and pieces
We walk through
You're a part of the game...
You're a part of the game
You're a slave to the grind
Oblivion
You've reached the promised land
You're a part of the game
You're cursed
You're damned
Welcome to the Otherland
Wait
I can feel things are not right
Do not breathe
Don't look behind,
There's someone else
The observer
A trick of light
A fading line
The entrance is gone
We can't get out of it
We are slightly losing ground
Quick
It is time
We shall go
We better leave
And don't come back,
No way to run
Nowhere to hide
I fear
We're walking aimlessly
You're a part of the game...
You're a part of the game
You're a slave to the grind
Oblivion
Welcome to the Otherland
You're a part of the game
You're cursed
You're damned
You've reached
The promised land
You've crossed the line
You've reached the end
Turn The Page
Hunter
We're here to praise your name,
Blazing sun
And a bitter death
You're a guardian
Cross the gate
Wake up it is a new dawning
Wake up the witches wait
For you
Remember the mirror
When she looked in
You were born in the void
In the middle of none
There was nobody else
There was nothing at all
Well sons and daughters
Joy's in the air
The horned one dies
Renewal
Everywhere
Turn the wheel again
A new beginning
Another end
Dried out the land needs blood
Inside the ring we're waiting
Give up yourself
Enter life
It's set out for you
Come turn the wheel
There is nothing to fear
Come turn the wheel
Come turn the page
Come turn the page
We do not believe in lies
Do not believe in lies
There is someone coming
There is someone coming
We hear a voice
From underworld
Now everything should move
When a new day begins
God of wind and god of rain
Turn the wheel
Oh you would better be aware
The mermaids
They will sing for you
The nymphs will bless the child
Reunite them
Sacrifice him
We will be with you until the end
Come move our hearts
We know
There is light beyond the dark
Dried out we cry for blood
Conquer your fear and join us
Come join us now
Time is right
It's set out for you...
A new beginning
Another end
The myth of life
You hold in your hand
We cry out
The land needs blood
The change of season
Praise to the newborn king
It's set out for you...
Fly
Stop be quite now
Out with the light and
Then up and down it goes
Fly
Out with the light
There at the door
The inspiration I've looked for
The spirit of the youth appears
No one ever dares to speak
It's nothing else but fantasy
It's make believe
Make believe
No one ever dares to speak
It's nothing else but fantasy
But one day
It all will come to life
Step out of line
And I'll teach you how to fly
Then away we'll go
Leave your mark land of mine
Leave your mark
In the land of mine
The second one to right
And then straight on
Until morning light
Stop be quite now
No irritation
No, not the slightest doubt
We got once
Quick - we better hurry
There from the road I sense
The end of fun gets near
Wonderful thoughts
And imaginations
These things will lift you up
What is it like?
You ask me, my dear
Will there be fairies
Or things to fear?
For fairies sake I'd say
You better come with me
So soon you'll see
Now up and down it goes
And round
Round and round and round
Praise
To my cleverness
They all follow me
All praise to innocence
That's everything it needs
Fly in
Fly out
They'll leave it all behind
No one ever dares to speak...
Life is a map
And it is quite confusing
The lights are up
Now let the play begin
She flies, she flies
Into the light she flies
No words like "Just" in mind
She's finding Neverland
There on the day she dies
Don't stop it now
She still enjoys the scene
Don't stop it now
Don't stop it now
Don't stop it now
Don't stop it now, now, now
No one ever dares to speak...
Carry The Blessed Home
Pale faced, the innocent
Will drown in blood
Hurt and withdrawn.
Don't dare to steal my grief
In this haze of green and gold
He's gone.
Blind my eyes
And I still
Can see through the mist
To the very end
There I'll face
What I fear the most.
Blind my eyes
But it all doesn't matter
Right now.
I would bury my dead
And keep on
'Til the end
I won't give up
I won't give up
I'll turn
To the "red fields of none"
There's a grave
There's a rose.
Drift away
I can hear me say
Soon you all shall be free.
Carry the blessed home
No one's left here but me
And I'll sing out your name.
You call me insane, I know.
I've open my heart
And my soul to you son
So pale turns the innocence
And all I feel is pain.
Suddenly I understand
He's gone.
Blind my eyes and I still can see through the mist...
But it all doesn't matter
Right now
Carry the blessed home
No one's left here but me
And I'll sing out your name.
Driven insane?
No
What I feared the most
I have faced, and that's truth.
The grey faced is not innocent
Though I cry in dismay
I will follow decay
I'll move on
Is there anyone here
Who knows
How it feels to be wrong?
Blind my eyes and I still can see through the mist...
But it all doesn't matter
Right now
Matter right now
Matter right now
Another Stranger Me
A seed of doubt
It exists
And it grows
A glimpse of life
From somewhere deep within
Awake and understand
Is there anyone else here?
Somebody screaming
Please help me
Let's find out now
That I am not dreaming
Welcome to my damnation
Here it comes the real me
I didn't know
I couldn't hear the answer
My mind was blank
I should have known
I hold it back but somehow
There is someone else
Another stranger me
Another stranger me
That's
When the ice
Will break away
I can't get out here
Anymore
Cause none of my keys
Fit the door
There's fear and anger
Hate and love
I must confess
It's out of hand
It's cynic
It's cynic
Still cynic
All my laughter
It's cynic
Just manic
It's cynic
All her laughter
If there's anyone in
It soon will be over
We'll burn out
Our soul's aflamed
And we're on our own now
Give up you cruel invasion
You're insane I'll show you
I didn't know...
Out and gone
Can't resist
Cold and sore
The bolt of pain
Keeps ripping through my head
I can take no more
Don't tell anyone else but I
Do not believe her
See hates me
Cloud my mind
She's a deceiver
I can feel cruel vibrations
Would you like to meet me?
I didn't know...
Another stranger me
Straight Through The Mirror
Can you tell me
Is there any other way?
I cannot hide it
I have doubts
I'm not afraid to stay
I'm here
When the curtain falls.
Once I've touched the rainbow,
The man on the moon will appear.
I won't show fear
I turn to you, father death
I'm begging you
Please
Consider
You may have been wrong
Just close your eyes now
Just close your eyes now
The end's a miracle
Dream on if you dare
Straight through the mirror
We'll sail on through the air
There's magic everywhere
Just be aware
Wake up when the crow will call
There is no truth
There are no rules,
There's no plot here
It's twisted
We're still on course
My friend
Down to the abyss - Orcus lane
Shelter of your memories
Shelter of your pain
The mirror shows truth
Reveals what you are
A phoenix in flames
Arise from the ashes again
We're on our way now
We're on our way now
The end's a miracle
Dream on if you dare
Straight through the mirror
We'll sail on through the air
I feel
There is something wrong.
It's twisting and turning
When everything's burning
Awake
It's not safe
And I'm coming down to you again
We'll sail our miracles and then
If you don't mind
I'll sing a song
A song of lullaby this time
When you're asleep
I'm back again
The world of miracles in hand
If you don't mind
I'll sing a song
A sort of lullaby this time
We're on our way now
We're on our way now
The end's a miracle...
Wake up when the crow will call
Lionheart
Just let me out of here
Speak to me
It all would be easier
I want to talk to you.
Who is that?
Do I hear a whisper?
Or do I hear a cry?
Across the brown land
The stumps of time
Oh turn the wheel and heal me
Since moonlight fade
I'm empty - heal me
I'm in search of the Lionheart
I am ashamed
I myself can't make it
Drown Ulysses
Drown here in the silence
Cause down to Hades I've gone
But I cannot get out
Down below
I can't free my mind
Soon I will fade away
Down below
I can't free my mind
Soon I will fade away
"Tic Tac" is the message.
And the lunatic fears
He is no more
Speak to me
It all would be easier
While I'm passing by
Who's that?
Do I hear a whisper?
Or do I hear a cry?
Across the brown land
The ghosts arrive.
Pick up my bones and
Tell me
Is this the "Lake of Fire"?
Hell?
Please
I'm in search of the Lionheart
Nobody else
But the pure can save me.
Drown Ulysses
Drown here in the silence
Cause down to Hades I've gone
But I cannot get out.
Ruins rule my memories
I can't recall the signs
Invite the dead
Then silence struck my mind
Silence is madness
"Tic Tac Tic Tactic"
Says the clock
Just let me out of here
Speak to me
It all would be easier
I want to talk to you
Hear me
Welcome to the sad place
And hand me what is mine
I'm the Theban prophet
The dead and blind
And from sea you'll feel me
Then you'll breath out gently
Leave me
I'm in search of the Lionheart...
Skalds And Shadows
Would you believe
In a night like this?
A night like this
When visions come true
Would you believe
In a tale like this?
A lay of bliss
We're praising the old lore
Come to the blazing fire and
See me in the Shadows
See me in the Shadows
Songs I will sing
Of runes and rings
Just hand me my harp
And this night
Turns into myth
Nothing seems real
You soon will feel
The World we live in
Is another skald's
Dream in the shadows
Dream in the shadows
Do you believe
There is sense in it
Is it truth or myth?
They're one in my rhymes
Nobody knows
The meaning behind
The weaver's line
Well nobody else
But the Norns can
See through
The blazing fires of time and
All things will proceed as the
Child of the hallowed
Will speak to you now
See me in the Shadows
See me in the Shadows
Songs I will sing
Of tribes and kings
The carrion bird
And the hall of the slain
Nothing seems real
You soon will feel
The World we live in
Is another skald's
Dream in the shadows
Dream in the shadows
Do not fear for my reason
There's nothing to hide
How bitter your treason
How bitter the lie
Remember the runes
And remember the light
All I ever want
Is to be at you side
We gladden the raven
Now I will
Run through the blazing fires
That's my choice
Cause things
Shall proceed as foreseen
The Edge
The world turned innocence
Can you hear me?
I confess I'm no redeemer
Can you hear me?
What shall I do?
I witnessed everything
Faith won't leave me
Mind my tongue
Faith don't leave me
Glow into words
This is the edge now
It's all we're living for
Rain on me
Love you will rain on me
And at the end I,
Boast in he cross
And now
Love reigns -
The god incarnation
I've shaped
Out there is a world on fire
Accursed the hanged one
Divine love for free
What a fateful night
And a grateful life
The choir echoes
"Every man his price"
Price
Light my agony
And crucify me
Void the law
At the ninth hour
Void the law
At the ninth hour
This is the edge now...
The world turns flesh again
Mystified are the final hours
No more fear in
No more fear in
Passover
The brook
Time it is at hand
Obscure the facts
A passion play
This is the edge now...
Hallowed be thy name
Hallowed be thy name
No more fear in
Come take a look
The old symbols they move
Wounds still bleed
That's creed
No more fear in
Can you see me?
Come take a look
At the depth of my soul
The New Order
Would you open the door
Son I know the way
Soon a flickering light
Will grow
Leave it to me now.
Unchained
Unchained
Would you open the door
Enter the here and now
A new horizon
You'll rise you'll fall
And learn to live
Keep the faith - keep the pace
Your soul's like water but
Your fate is like the wind
Here is the new order
Hope shall be your guide
Praise the new order
Now let my spirit go
Do you remember
When we were moon knights?
We've slain the dragon
In the room
Now you see the future
Your quest the truth
How will it end up
I really do not know
This is no wonderland
Just keep in mind
Like a spell in certain books
Time will change it all
Away - oh please embrace me
Away - I will be gone
I'll take a look to see
What lies beyond
The break of dawn
Would you open the door
There is so much more to say
Keep the faith
Keep the pace.
Your soul's like water, but
Your fate is like the wind.
Here is the new order...
Will you remember the old rule?
Will you fulfill this sacrifice?
Done for the future
Space for the new
How will it end up?
That's up to you
You're on the bridge -
On the borderline
No matter how
You'll never ever leave it
Here is the new order...
Times will change
The soul's like water and
Like rain it will return
Live on in healing rain
The past shall find release
All The King's Horses
I can feel I'm one
With the tortured land
With its solitude and decay
There's no one left
All the other men
Pass on through the night
All dead and gone
Still I don't dare to move
The imprisoned soul
Cannot find back home
Snow falls down
It covers field and blood
Snow falls down
And clears the view
It is cold
And once again
The battle's fought
Out on the plains
So rhymes spread out its glory
But
No rhyme defines its pain
I can't recall all their names
Connection broke loose
They've crossed the lake
Reach the other side
And leave me alone
With the truth
All the king's horses
And all the king's men
They've failed to damn the flood
They've failed to find the grail
Talisien, old friend of mine
Sing my song
Then once again
The battle's lost
I am to blame
Snow falls down
All dead and gone
They all are dead and gone
They've turned to dust
They've sealed the past
A long long time ago
I can't recall all their names
Connection broke loose
They've crossed the lake
Reach the other side
And leave me alone
With the truth
I can't recall all their names
Connection broke loose
They've crossed the lake
Reach the other side
And leave me alone
With the truth
Dead Sound Of Misery
It's dark
Let's do it now
Bring in the sirens
Cut of their tongues
Do it now
Ignore their cries
Ignore their cries
Now close the door
And leave it
Nothing went wrong
The Archangel is falling
Mourners split
Take heart of grace
A ghostly candle light
Lit my room at night
Son of man
We're breeding wastelands
Wastelands
The blood of Sirens
On my hands
I can't wash away
Still it pours
And stains our land
In bitterness
So cruel
Will ages go by
Dead sound of misery
Come share our sorrows
Be one with the Hydra
It's drown or burn
I'm exploring bedlam
The time is right to move
Furthermore
Bring out the dead
Turn your back
On the ones you have loved
Enjoy the heat of your whore
Babylon
Hear what the spirits says
There is no sense at all
Now come with me
Unfold the seals
No sense at all
No sense at all
There is no sense at all
So many times I have failed
Pure desperation
Still hear the cries
Of voices
Long gone by
They've gone abroad
And left this world behind
Leave me behind
Behind the walls I'm crying
The blood of Sirens...
So many times I have failed
Pure desperation
Still hear the cries
Of voices
Long gone by
They've gone abroad
And left this world behind
Leave me behind
Behind the walls I'm crying
The blood of Sirens...
The Ninth Wave
As dark night embraces
We are the nation
I will cleanse all your thoughts
We will cleanse them all
Now, my children
For the sake of our nation
Let us carry on
In glory
When dark night embraces
We are the nation
Be my fellowmen
We will wipe them out
Let there be light
For the sake of our nation
Precious and bright
When dark night embraces my mind
A twisted plan 
After all
Despite all burden
Life has grown
And though the curse is still alive
File 664
The golden age's vanished and more
The ingenious knight knows it's over
He no longer denies there's a real me
He'll be disgraced
Burnt and sealed
They may end
As we will rule the world
Defeat the dying old Crow
Let this fire burn
Sail on till you reach the promised land
We all drown in the fifth dimension
The ninth wave
I can feel it's coming
The ninth wave
Sail on till you reach the promised land
We all wait for a new tomorrow
We'll bring a new age
Along with the final wave
The final wave
We will rise
Burn them all, bring the damned
There's a price to pay
Burn them all, bring the damned
Do as I command
Our praise and triumph will grow
We'll defy the Nine
Delete the dying old Crow
To Muriel's fire, walk with me
Down to the Abaddon
Will you walk with me to the Sheol?
Good or bad we all meet the Abaddon
Take a look and you see it's all the same
Imaginations
Exterminate them
Imaginations
Exterminate them
An evil revelation
A wicked thought
Denied by their savior
They all prayed for
Salvation
There are no gods
So no one can save them
Until
They will redeem Belial
They will unite them all
Then many men will fall
When they will heed the call
So they'll be free
Before the final curtain falls
Belial
Bring the cursed
Bring the damned
As we will rule the world
They'll seek the dying old Crow
Let this fire burn
Sail on till you reach the promised land
We all drown in the fifth dimension
The ninth wave
I can feel it's coming
The ninth wave
Sail on till you reach the promised land
We all wait for a new tomorrow
We'll bring a new age
Reborn as aeon gods
As aeon gods
We'll break through
Further down you'll walk with me
Down to seal Avalon
Will you walk with me to the fire?
Further down we come to seal Avalon
Take a look and you see it's all the same
Imaginations
Determination
Imaginations
Determination
There is no real salvation
We will wipe them out
And nothing remains here
As we don't need salvation
We will not fade
Forever we'll stay here
Screams come from the inside
The king is gone, but
This war is not over
Cries come from the outside
Yes, void will find thee
This war is not over
Burnt and sealed they may end
As we will rule the world
Delete the dying old Crow
Let this fire burn
Sail on till you reach the promised land
We all drown in the fifth dimension
The ninth wave
I can feel it's coming
The ninth wave
Sail on till you reach the promised land
We all wait for a new tomorrow
We'll bring a new age
Reborn as aeon gods
As aeon gods
We'll break through
Twilight Of The Gods
How've they dared to be
Such misguided creatures
How've they dared to be
Of such evil nature
Spiral up to doors all sealed
No turning back
Red door to Discordia
Steal the stars
Deceive the day
A sign of evil
They're gone with a final warning
Witness the twilight of the gods
Will they ever return
A storm will take us
And then wipe us out
There's no retreat
We're trapped in twilight
While the gods will drowse
Gods will drowse
They'll wait and sleep
Until a new dawn'll save us from the dark
The damage's done
The king is gone
There is war
Wherever I'll roam
Gods will come and
Gods will go
The spinning wheel keeps turning
Now get up
Lay down your ancient faith
We're the chosen ones
Come feel the change
A way
Let me show a new way
When you dare to walk with me
Bow down
And surrender
The old gods
Black or white
To me it's grey
A sign of evil
I hail all these non-believers
Witness the twilight of the gods
Will they ever return
A storm will take us
And then wipe us out
There's no retreat
We're trapped in twilight
While the gods will drowse
Gods will drowse
They'll wait and sleep
Until a new dawn'll save us from the dark
Deliver your gods
They shall be slain
I'm their fallen son
Don't be afraid
A way
Let me show a new way
When you're going to walk with me
As one
We're infernal
What's going up
It will come down
We're here to change
There's war in Discordia
Sure as death
We all must fade
A sign of evil
Now reach for a new horizon
Witness the twilight of the gods
Will they ever return
A storm will take us
And then wipe us out
There's no retreat
We're trapped in twilight
While the gods will drowse
Gods will drowse
They'll wait and sleep
Until a new dawn'll save us from the dark
Prophecies
I can see a crow
On your judgement day
Seems like a sermon
Please come over
Don't come over
Please come over
Here
Welcome the last day of our lives
I will break the circle
Walls, I'll tear them down
And guilt will break the silence
But there is no return
No return
We shall overcome
We will bring you back
To a moment in time
We will reveal and detect
What you are
Precious truth in a cage
It has been captured but safe
And there we'll bind it and
Blind it with lies
The king will come
World will come undone
He is the center of creation
The prophecy
It's a promise to us all
A crow, a storm
Shadows will be rising soon
A crow, a storm
The Nine sing
Once upon a dream ago
We're the ones you've left alone
Now, as we speak
There's a way
There's a door
Come find us
And join us
Come see it and feel it
Doors in and out
You shall be falling
Your mind's still trapped in twilight
Now, catch a glimpse
Shall I get through
They've walked on
To the other side
But how could I know?
I'm drowning
Drowning
Where do I belong?
Drown in shadows
I am the center of creation
They prophecy
It's a promise to us all
A crow, a storm
Shadows will be rising soon
A crow, a storm
The Nine sing
Once upon a dream ago
We're the ones you've left alone
Don't blame me
Don't blame me
It's my lying toad
The Crow and the Hare
They've moved
Further into the unknown
Mark my words
They will be gone
You'll see them playing games, my dear
They've moved along
Cause one day in the afterlife
We'll meet again
They've frowning
Frowning
On your judgement day
They are shadows
They're in the center of creation
They prophecy
It's a promise to us all
A crow, a storm
Shadows will be rising soon
A crow, a storm
The Nine sing
Once upon a dream ago
We're the ones you've left alone
But don't be afraid
There's war beyond the red door
And please ignore their pleas
Just break the seal
Break the seal, find the red door
There's a red
There's a red
There's a fed door
Break the seal, find the red door
The eternal
The infernal
The eternal
We shall better get him back
The eternal
The infernal
The eternal
Will we ever see the light again
At The Edge Of Time
I step from door to door
My mind's misguided
Keep moving on and on
Forevermore
Was it real what I saw in the mirror?
Was it fear when the end got clearer?
Now as my time's passing by
What am I waiting for?
Who'll grant me wings to fly?
And will I have another try?
'Cause I would not miss my moment again
Yes, I would not miss my moment my friend
No one knows the answer
What could have been
The edge I still fear
The roads they're leading nowhere
There is no end, no end
Oh gods be with me
Carry me along 
I blindness I tried to march on 
Mystified me
Yes, it fooled me
No surrender 
Don't surrender
I hear them calling
I hear them calling
Can hear them scream
Don't be late when aeons pass
Your memories will fade
Even the purest one might fail
Here and deceive
The righteous soul
And then their world will come undone
They burn, they bleed
Till the savior will break through
In between the realms they're gathered
And from the edge of time
Once they return
They will save us all
Now break through
Recall the eclipse
There is none who survive
Defeat, defeat, defeat
There's no more
You've searched for the answer
The answer is creed
They're real no more
You cannot get over, no more
My light shall shine forever
The Nine beyond the wall
They're turning
They're burning
They now understand
I soon will seal all doors
Their stars won't shine here anymore
Their savior won't even try
He can't remember the truth
My words become real
And there's nothing they can do
They may follow a plan the one had
Deeply sad
They have chosen the wrong side
And tried to resist
All their visions and music
No longer exist
When the morrow will come
It shall all be
In between
In between the realms
In between the realms
They might move on
That's when all pureness dies in vain
There's no release
The infernal lord has won
And forevermore
Yes, forevermore
They burn, they bleed
Till the savior will break through
In between the realms they're gathered
And from the edge of time
Once they return
They will save us all
Now break through
Will I 
Yes, will I fail to believe, my friend?
What if it's all done in vain?
Don't afraid
Will it be me they blame?
See, it's a whole world
That I've once condemned
And I shattered it all
With a thought as it seems
But it all has been me
As the mirror has revealed
Now reveal
Now redeem
I will carry the storm
The savior's coming home
Yes, I'll carry the grail
And I'll wash away the pain
There's no release
The infernal lord has won
And forevermore
Yes, forevermore
They burn, they bleed
Till the savior will break through
In between the realms they're gathered
And from the edge of time
Once they return
They will save us all
Now break through
Where do you go?
Where do you go from here?
I don't look back
There's more in me
My hour shall come
The old gods are calling
Then straight ahead
A door appears
The tyrant must go down
That's when the ancient gods return
They will return
Ashes Of Eternity
The Hare once betrayed me
And so did the Fox and the Crow
Just once defied me
There's me and there's Space
Where are they?
Maybe dead
No one knows
You can't defy me
Ride all along
With me
There's no tomorrow
Now let me through
And wait for my command
Don't try to be cruel
Oh, my beautiful child
But how can you try to redeem the past?
It's not real as it seems
Now ride on your wave
And get back to that place
Scratch deeper and deeper
And soon I will be on my own
The gods will ignore your end
They'll defend the elder
The lords won't salute you
The saints they won't save you 
They'll defend their guardian
The savior won't heal your soul
Caesar
No man's world
It's the Ides of March
Then from the ashes of eternity
A new spirit will rise
A new order shall take over
Now
Raise the flag
The war seems over
And bow your head
At dawn they shall be murdered
Woes, I will not complain
The further you get
The closer's the end, dear
But now
I will try
Come and see
That things are not what they may seem
It's all written down
The savior lies bleeding
But he won't surrender
The scriptures don't lie
He'll e turned around
No one to blame
It all goes down
The gods will ignore your end
They'll defend the elder
The lords won't salute you
The saints they won't save you 
They'll defend their guardian
The savior won't heal your soul
Now go and get
Your holy grail
And don't forget
Just once you'll cross the border
Now let the saints
The saints come marching in
Whatever you'll do
Do it fast
My sweet son of decay
Now let the saints
The saints come marching in
Transform
You may pass
Rearrange it
Now change to betray
I won't lie
While bright eyes are turning pale
Your sands run low
Your light shines
My last try
It'll soon be over
No sign shall be given for ages and more
You may enter first
But from now you will be on your own
The gods will ignore your end
They'll defend the elder
The lords won't salute you
The saints they won't save you 
They'll defend their guardian
The savior won't heal your soul
You're getting your grail
But there's no place to go
Longing for a new shore
Eastern winds they blow cold
The saints you will bring them down
The savior won't take the crown
Let my spirit fly
Let it fly
Distant Memories
Now Storm come closer
Can feel you're getting near
Just stay invisible till it’s over
But still they don’t know
They're just caught in distant memories
Then these fools will fade away
They may not fear the fall
They won't be anymore
I hear their silent singing
We don't fear anymore
We don't fear him
Now don't come closer
Stand still
Don't interfere
Don’t move or things go wrong
We're trapped in twilight
Trapped in the mind of a sacrificial king
And the sun won't shine here anymore
I curse the Crow
Dear old friend
And when the time is right for changes
We will salute you
And a new age may begin
But still they don't know
They're just caught in distant memories
Then these fools will fade away
They may not fear the fall
When all the magic is gone
No need to carry it along
Whatever the cost
It will not be redeemed
And whatever may come
It will not bring relief
In the mirror
They may fail to see
What is real behind
There it ends
And there is no return
They will go down
They all will have to drown
Out of the dark
Into the grey
These fools will fade away
No matter what
I've come to say
These fools will fade away
A storm comes closer
Can feel you're getting near?
Just stay invisible, you're no savior
But still they don’t know
They're just caught in distant memories
Then these fools will fade away
They may not fear the fall
I know they reach out for someone
Reach out for the great unknown
But still they don't know
They're just caught in distant memories
Then these fools will fade away
They may not fear the fall
They've thought
It is time for changes
We will salute you
Moved on to the promised land
We will salute you
Now let it begin
They've found a new god
The Holy Grail
We, together
Change the world forever
What a cheerful sound
Synchronize me
Supervise me, mother
No more fooling around
Whatever may come
It shall be from the ashes
He shall rise, I know
And though it hurts me
Don't be surprised, dear mother
Longing to see his end
Don't call it
Hopelessly insane
I go and grasp the grail
But in a graceful way
Illegally, my aim
The grail will cross the border now
Don't tell me that you're innocent
Don't tell me it's divinely ordained by the saints
My demons, my saviors
I weep for all of them
Suffered in vain
My wayward son, you might disturb me
Carry the flame
Till dying embers will stop gleaming
There on the battlefield she sings
Praise, hallelujah
The Holy Grail's on its way now
Magna eterna
Magna eterna sings
Your journey's over
The Holy Grail's on its way now
Do as it's foreseen
Come and meet the king
There's no choice
For the word it must be
Real, my righteous brother
Fear you soon will know
So, on the fourteenth day passover
He took the firstborn sons
Execute him and now act as
Judas, the chosen one
So after all, in vain
I've met him and found the grail
Cause in a skillful way
I'll change to keep alive 
Eternal lie, I'll be the one
Key to life, be the eclipse
Voices from the river Styx
Come to be the Nemesis
Kiss of death
Crucifix and the grail
I've traveled far on hidden pathways
The Holy Grail
Who would have thought that I will hold it
The Holy Grail
There on the battlefield she sings
Praise, hallelujah
The Holy Grail's on its way now
Magna eterna
Magna eterna sings
Your journey's over
The Holy Grail's on its way now
Don't tell me that you're innocent
Don't tell me that there is a chance to be free
The grail's sent, my way ends
I creep along with the shadows
And resurrected
He comes marching in
There he is
Good lord forgive my sins
Once I've crossed the river Styx
At Sheol's gate, I know
Key to the apocalypse
I have sealed it with a kiss
Nothing that I want to do
Hades is calling
Wake the witch, who'll be the brave one?
Don't say what he's like
Full of voices comes the ninth wave
Don't say what it's like
Beyond the door
There on the battlefield she sings
Praise, hallelujah
The Holy Grail's on its way now
Magna eterna
Magna eterna sings
Your journey's over
The Holy Grail's on its way now
Norns are howling
Norns are prowling
The Throne
Get him off the throne
Moreover he's not in control no longer
The King will come, it's over
The game goes on
Someone's waiting on the other side
Trying to get over
Got to be in this hour
There on the other side
We know that someone keeps waiting
Don't you know your enemy?
Don't you know you're damned?
Release the beast
Set it free
I've come to tell you once more
Don't let him break this seal
But let me tell you once more
Peace shall come
We must serve the fire
We must confess we are liars
There must be something in the end
We're the curse
Got to feed it
We must serve the fire
Determination
Blame the light
For all must burn down in the end
We must serve the fire
We must serve the fire
Give us shelter from the storm
Give us hope
Give us shelter from the storm
Give us hope
Curse the wind
A storm from the north
Comes to divide us
Will deny us
To break your king
These were dark lands
In a dead world
Rearranged
We brought it into light
A union of the land and king
It's a new world
It is new land
But it ends here
In the here and now
Another failure once again
We will not believe in any word you may say
We will not believe in any word you may say
Now we can see the enemy
I've come to tell you once more
It's me, I hold the key
But let me tell you once more
Peace shall come
We must serve the fire
We must confess we are liars
There must be something in the end
We're the curse
Got to feed it
We must serve the fire
Determination
Blame the light
For all must burn down in the end
We must serve the fire
It's a curse we are all bound
We must serve the fire
Curse them all
They'll tear down the wall
Come to divide us
They'll defy us
Take my throne
All I am is nothing else
What you have made me
Nothing more I am
Your vision of another god
All I know is they won't give
But they will take
Your sacred light away
And still they come to praise the damned
Can't you see?
It's your innocence they'll steal away
Yes, they're coming for you
They've come to deceive
You are betrayed
You admire these liars
They'll never fool me
We will not surrender
We won't take it no more
We will not surrender
We won't take it anymore
We'll break the seal and set 'em free
I've come to tell you once more
As I will now reveal
But let me tell you once more
Peace is gone
We must serve the fire
We must confess we are liars
There must be something in the end
We're the curse
Got to feed it
We must serve the fire
Determination
Blame the light
For all must burn down in the end
We must serve the fire
It's a curse we are all bound
We must serve the fire
We're the curse
Got to feed it
We must serve the fire
Determination
Blame the light
We must serve the fire
It's a curse we are all bound
We must serve the fire
Determination
Blame the light
Blame the night
Day and night
Black and white
Take a look at yourself
There is nothing to fear no more
There is nothing to fear no more
Sacred Mind
Could not break the silence
Could not move in here
How can they stay so silent?
All the grief and violence
For all they went through
For all it breaks loose
It's bursting out 
Fire, walk with me
Fire, walk with me
The will is strong
Can I show you Fear?
Don't move
Don't turn
Don't come too close as I 
Burn down this place
My spirit will set it all on fire
Would you like to meet the tyrant in the twilight zone?
Get in, don't be late
And breathe in my reality
But first break the silence
There is more
Beyond the dawn he's rising
Where darkness grows
He traveling in disguise
Now don't look back
Now you know why
We set sail to new shores
We will meet him
Sacred mind
We build a new pleasure-dome here
Xanadu
My Xanadu
My Xanadu
Don't look back, just enter
What I call my soul asylum
Where they are playing tricks
Everybody
If you like to see
Whatever lies beyond that golden door
It seems
My frequency's turned weak
Try to remember me
Try to remember me
Then for a while
We've heard the sounds of sirens
You turn to stone
Medusa's in your sight
I tell you why
Rearranged by the ages gone by
You can change it
Sacred mind
We build a new pleasure-dome here
Xanadu
My Xanadu
My Xanadu
Sacred mind
We build a new pleasure-dome here
Xanadu
My Xanadu
My Xanadu
Chance or predestined end
Praise, hallelujah
Never mind the end
Fool the mall
Fear the demon in disguise
Keep your secret inside
Let's move on, it's time
A thousand years gone by
The pleasure-dome
What will we hear
And what will we see
All a lie
There's no boat
There's no river 
No shore
Journey's over
Sacred mind
We build a new pleasure-dome here
Xanadu
My Xanadu
My Xanadu
Miracle Machine
When they are coming
Give us guidance
For they are calling
To erase the damned
Yet, after all they praise the coming
To erase the damned
They will return
Now let me take you to the other side
Turn off the light and let it grow
They will set it on fire
They come to fool us all
They are slaves to the Fire, you know
Their fire must grow
They have to feed it
We must believe in something
That I would call a miracle
The grail will break the final seal
We must believe in something
A miracle, a miracle machine
We just hide it secretly
No belief, no belief, no belief
Give us what we need
Betrayed by the Nine
I've learned to love the shadows
And now they're coming home
That's why I need you on the other side
And then we, we may carry another light
I summon from the inside, deeper insight
They don't belong here
Though they claim they're right
Let it grow
Turn off the light
Let reason grow
They will set it on fire
They come to fool us all
They are slaves to the Fire, you know
Their fire must grow
They have to feed it
We must believe in something
That I would call a miracle
The grail will break the final seal
We must believe in something
A miracle, a miracle machine
We just hide it secretly
For they are coming
Give us guidance
Grand Parade
Let this game begin
Watch, my children
Watch me
You've all come to die
For this battle is lost
Lost
Losing their minds
Losing their souls
Hush, now hush
We don't talk
We don't care anymore
I will seal every door
We don't care anymore
I summon the Nine now
Confirm the alignment
Can I get through?
Carry on, you fools
Try to break free
When we fail
It's lost forever
When we fail
It's lost forever
It's not real, no reason to be here
No more fear and no more regrets
Don't look back and free your mind
Stay where you are till the sealing is over
Say goodbye, my friend
Here's your promised end
Be a part of the grand parade
Along we're driven
On and on, it's a grand parade
We're one, we're so sorry to say
It's all the same, you will see
On this grand parade
Damnation
Now join the grand parade
Don't be upset
I will seal every door
Every now and then
Seal every door
They'll try to awake the misguided
I will seal every door
The voices you'll hear
They will claim to be real
It's not true
Now look around
We will bring them down
The more I'll show
The less you will know
The Nine will frown
Now see how it grows
Secretly my vision comes true
It's not real
You'll hear it, you'll see it
The otherworld
The otherworld
The otherworld appears
Now round and round
We all shall lose ground
Now praise, I'm the one
We will never fear
We will never fear
We will never fear them again
Oh and here comes the son, the son
He's gone with the shadows
Along with the stars
No more gods, no more lies
No more gods, no war
We'll be free here, we are one
Our will is strong
No more lies and no more tyrants
It all becomes real when the sealing is over
Say goodbye, my friend
Here's your promised end
Be a part of the grand parade
Along we're driven
On and on, it's a grand parade
We're one, we're so sorry to say
It's all the same, you will see
On this grand parade
Damnation
Now join the grand parade
There is no return
It would be the end
We shall sing, we shall sing
Praise the day
Void
We don't fear you no more
Mother void
You can't enter no more
We don't need any hallows
We don't fear any shadows
Shadows on the wall
They're not real
Now, walk in, everyone
Here comes the sun
We will never fall
We will never fall
We will never see him again
Many
We're one
We're humanized
The time has come
This flesh is truth
This blood is real
The highest cause
It's all that we are longing for
There on the river Styx
You'll see, my friend
There on the river Styx
You'll see
They've fooled you to take it away
So no more myths
No more bliss
We are holding it in our hand
And there is nothing they can do
And so this battle ends forevermore
We don't fear anything
Nor any other race
We take control
No longer we act like fools
We're in control
Say goodbye, my friend
Here's your promised end
Be a part of the grand parade
Along we're driven
On and on, it's a grand parade
We're one, we're so sorry to say
It's all the same, you will see
On this grand parade
Damnation
Now join the grand parade
Drown one more time
While we all will say goodbye
Bright, it shines bright
Let us carry one the lie
No more lies, all a lie
One more lie
Doom
How did I get here?
What will I find here?
I've come to meet
The evil one
I understand
There is no sense
The curse lives on
My children mourn
Truth is a beast
With a sad face
A demon
The cruelest of all
Forever
Forever
I'm wondering
Who is it for?
There's nothing more
There is no door
No more lies
You won't enter
You will see
They've locked the secret place out
And day won't come again
So there's no relief
When truth shall be revealed
By now you know the answer
So there's no relief
But revenge
Abandoned, forgotten, deceived
Wherever they may roam
So faithful, so loyal
Still no one will come
You're alone
Don't call it destiny
We will remember
Skies may fade
And stars may wane
We won't forget
And your light shines bright
Yes, so much brighter
Shine on
We will remember
Until the skies will fall
We won't forget
We will remember
We all shall follow doom
It's going down
Going down
And there's nothing you can do
Look into my eyes
And see
Your seed
It may grow
This is no vision
It's the curse I set upon your kin
You'll be deceived
Their cries shall come true
It shall be me
You blame
Now watch and see
I'll set doom
Upon you
Your offspring shall bloom
Wherever they may roam
I'll bind them
I'll split them
In solitude
Sorrow shall grow
Unknown
We will remember
Skies may fade
And stars may wane
We won't forget
And your light shines bright
Yes, so much brighter
Shine on
We will remember
Until the skies will fall
We won't forget
We will remember
We all shall follow doom
There is no choice
There's repentance
'Cause nothing will grow here at all
Redeem the oath
And pay the price
If you want
Here on these fields
Where truth shall be revealed
In doom you'll find the answers
Still there's no release
You shall feel
Let's face it
Since everything's shown
You've been through this alone
The deeper the wounds
So much greater the sorrows will grow
There is no sense in it
We will remember
Skies may fade
And stars may wane
We won't forget
And your light shines bright
Yes, so much brighter
Shine on
We will remember
Until the skies will fall
We won't forget
We will remember
We all shall follow doom
Fly
Stop, be quiet now
Out with the light and,
Then up and down it goes
Fly out with the light
There at the door,
The Inspiration I´ve looked for,
The Spirit of the youth appears
No one ever dares to speak
It's nothing else but fantasy
It's make believe, make believe
No one ever dares to speak
It's nothing else but fantasy
But One day it all will come to life
Step out of line
And I'll teach you how to fly
The Away we´ll go
Leave your mark, leave your mark in the land of mine
The second one to the right
And then Straight on until morning light
Stop, be quiet now
No irritation
No not the slightest doubt
We go at once
Quick - We better hurry,
There from the road I sense
The end of fun gets near
Wonderful thoughts and imaginations
These dreams will lift you up
What is it like? You ask me, my dear
Will there be fairies, or things to fear
For fairies sake I'd say you better come with me
So soon you´ll see,
Now up and down it goes and round
Round and round and round,
Praise to my cleverness
They all follow me,
All praise to innocence
That's everything it needs,
Fly in,
Fly out,
They leave it all behind
No one ever dares to speak
It's nothing else but fantasy
It's make believe,
Make believe
No one ever dares to speak
It's nothing else but fantasy
But One day it will all come to life
Step out of line
And I'll teach you how to fly
The Away we´ll go
Leave your mark land of mine
Leave your mark in the land of mine
Life is a map and it is quite confusing
The lights are up now let the play begin
She flies, she flies,
Into the light she flies
No words like "ust" in mind
She's finding Neverland
There on the day she dies
Don't stop it now,
She still enjoys the scene
Don't stop it now,
Don't stop it now,
Don't stop it now,
Don't stop it now, now, now
No one ever dares to speak
It's nothing else but fantasy
It's make believe,
Make believe
No one ever dares to speak
It's nothing else but fantasy
But One day it will all come to life
Step out of line
And I'll teach you how to fly
The Away we´ll go
Leave your mark land of mine
Leave your mark in the land of mine
Scalds And Shadows
Would you believe in a night like this?
A night like this, when visions come true
Would you believe in a tale like this?
A lay of bliss, we're praising the old lore
Come to the blazing fire and
See me in the shadows
See me in the shadows
Songs I will sing
Of runes and rings
Just hand me my harp
This night turns into myth
Nothing seems real
But you soon will feel
The world we live in is another t´s
Dream in the shadows
Dream in the shadows
Do you believe there is sense in it?
Is it truth or myth?
They´re one in my ryhmes
Nobody knows the meaning behind
The weaver´s line
Well nobody else but the Noms can
See through the blazing fires of time and
All things will proceed as the
Child of the hallowed
Will speak to you now
See me in the shadows
See me in the shadows
Songs I will sing of tribes and kings
The carrion bird and the hall of the slain
Nothing seems real
You soon will feel
The world we live in is another Skald´s
Dream in the shadows
Dream in the shadows
Do not fear for my reason
There's nothing to hide
How bitter your treason
How bitter the lie
Remember the runes and remember the light
All I ever want is to be at your side
We gladden the raven
Now I will run through the blazing fires
That's my choice
'Cause things shall procede as foreseen
In A Gadda Da Vida
In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida, honey,
Don't you know that I love you?
In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida, baby,
Don't you know that I'll always be true?
Oh, won't you come with me
And take my hand?
Oh, won't you come with me
And walk this land?
Please take my hand!
Sacred Worlds
The realm's bleeding
it suffers -
Old an weak
No further arguing
There is war at hand
The system's failing
Engine's running
Then after all
I sense the end is dawning
These lunatics deny the truth
I know I will not fail
There'll be
War
It's now or never
We shall stand together
One by one
This world is sacred
I'm coming home
War
It's now or never
We shall stand together
One by one
This world is sacred
I'm coming home
Coming home
You chase in twilight
and you know
you will be on your own
on your own
The misery shown
I'll be alone in this hour
I face the unknown
Witness the end
I'm bleeding. I'm fading
Here in my final hour
When long lost memories return
And a voice keeps calling
"All dead and gone
it's out of hand
Life is in motion"
I'm wishing. I'm fading
"Time to wake up
face the truth"
I'm sinking
I'm drowning
There's no doubt and no regret
"Time to reveal now"
This is no illusion
It is real
Carry on the flame
It's not over now
Watch me, I will rise
Time to reveal now
I know I will not fail
Anymore
I'm the one forever
All that really matters
Blessed realm
This world is sacred
I'm coming home
War
It's now or never
We shall stand together
One by one
This world is sacred
I'm coming home
Yesterday's gone
There's no today, no tomorrow
I'm raised from the dead
The ritual failed
There at the gates
I'm left alone in this hour
Driven insane
I am left alone
And now i drown in deepest shadows
While the golden hall is sealed
I'm wishing
I'm fading
And I'm part of the machine
My eyes are the eyes of a dead man
and feel the unholy stream
The source of my power
T-energy
I'm in control
I will live forever
All that really matters
Blessed realm
This world is sacred
I'm coming home
War
It's now or never
We shall stand together
One by one
This world is sacred
I'm coming home
I spread my wings
But keep on falling
I should have known
I can see it coming
The war is over
There's whispering in the wind
Just let me out of here
There is no way
There's no end
While all the suffering goes on
All that I know
Is that I'm not insane
It's not over
Tanelorn
I travel a dusty old road
And carry on in ultimate terror
The torture will grow
While infinity's lost
The lunatic fears the unknown
Into the fire
Curse me
Unknown
Into the fire
Everything is gone
Did I miss the point
Or fail to see
That I am lost
Cause I am chosen
Crush another tower
Grind the universe
I'll fear it into pieces
Mourn forevermore
And here I
Cry for Tanelorn
Still I fear their voices
Cry for Tanelorn
No more fear, no voices
Cry for Tanelorn
Into the void this journey ends
Cry for Tanelorn
The dawn comes crashing down
Into the void
My locked up asylum
Don't turn your back
On your prodigal son
When terror is raging
Still my hate will grow
Here on my own
I've built a pyre
Oh, fire
Here on my own
I've wasted life
So weak
A dark sword
A black soul
My soulmate gets near
Deceiver
Deceiver
I'm banned from the island
Refuse my, deny me
I'm pale and I'm weak
Now I don't belong here anymore
Cry for Tanelorn
Still I fear their voices
Cry for Tanelorn
No more fear, no voices
Cry for Tanelorn
Into the void this journey ends
Cry for Tanelorn
The dawn comes crashing down
Into the void
The trouble of many I've seen
It's coming to an end
Here's my last stand
The torture at last
Will be gone with the past
Infinity. Where will I go?
Into the fire
Curse me
In war
Into the fire
Everything is gone
It's your blood I desire
The last soul I require
Right alter all the damage will down
And here I
Cry for Tanelorn
Still I fear their voices
Cry for Tanelorn
No more fear, no voices
"Feeding my void
Feeding my void
Here at the edge. I claim your soul"
Cry for Tanelorn
The dawn comes crashing down
Into the void
Stormbringer
All hail stormbringer
Road Of No Release
Please, sister, wake me up
you've traveled far
Release my mind
Sing this song of mine
Save me from drowning
Quick, cast your spell on me
I sense you're finally getting near
Can you hear me crying?
I've got to break the silence
I know they're out there
Play hide and seek
watching
My love is wasted
My worst dreams
I can't leave them
I'm the black queen
Here in barren lands
When you walk down
You may not find relief
will you go down there
I wonder
Wonder why
Here on this road of no release
Pale reign of misery
That even time cannot erase
On through my sorrows
Life will go on
Words and dreams unite
I hear an ancient voice
It's calling for me
When death and life collide
I hear an ancient song
Deep inside
I can't find myself
Can't remember at all
The past and my strange end
come guide me now
Can't remember my fall
There's something
There's someone
It's ain't over now
The void - There's more to it
It's real and still alive
I will find you
Slipping away
I'll bind you
Still I conquer the world
Take him away
Here on this road of no release
Pale reign of misery
That even time cannot erase
On through my sorrows
Life will go on
My last steps
Can't leave her
I, the old fox
Will take revenge
I cannot heal your fear and doubts
The void, It waits for us
Still, After all the ghosts are howling
You cannot run, you cannot hide
The void, it waits for us
Still after all there is no choice
Here on this road of no release
Pale reign of misery
That even time cannot erase
On through my sorrows
Life will go on
Find me, I'm drowning
Then once again
There's nothing left I fear
There's nothing more to say
And no more games to play
to play
Ride Into Obsession
Come, I show you the end
You're dammed
Cause no one can defy me
Just watch these maddened creatures
Like you they all once reached out
A war to win
But I'm gonna burn this vision down
Call me the father of lies
Just watch these saddened creatures
they've torned you into their savior
You hold your ground
Until your last breath
You'll twist then turn
and now you're falling down
The battle rages on
And forever and ever
The wheel will turn
Let ages come and go
The will turn now
The wheel will turn
Another ride into obsession
I am reborn
The wheel will turn now
And I am driven to obsession
All these dying men
try to understand
They all followed the sign
Ir's a cyrcle's end
There no hope
for a while
 From the ashes arise
Can't save her
Enjoy the flames
So precious, so pure
and you try
You're sure to fail
And madness
Is the price you've to pay
Unholy grounds
Witness your last breath
The cyrcle ends
And you're stumbling
The battle will go on
and forever and ever
It's raging on
Let ages come and go
The wheel will turn now
The wheel will turn
Another ride into obsession
I am reborn
The wheel will turn now
And I'm driven to obsession
Through the flames you'll see me
You'll be mine, believe me
This is the moment I long for
Wake up there's a storm to face and
Right now while the land lies bleeding
It's me, I conquer your soul
Still I'll be on my way
Oh light, let me out of here I pray
And over and over and over again
There is no beginning
No end
This war, it still goes on
And forever and ever
I will return
Let ages come and go
The wheel will turn now
The wheel will turn
Another ride into obsession
I am reborn
The wheel will turn now
And I'm driven to obsession
Light - so serene
True source reign over me
There's no end and
There's no beginning
"You will never be alone"
Curse My Name
The tenure of kings and their magistrates
By good men it must be deposed
The convenant made can be voided at once
Disanoint him, take his crown
They plead for their king
And they pity their lord
Put him to death, that's what I say
Though never so just these dancing divines
Endue him with reason and grace
They're gibberish
Words dissemble the facts
God's will
They falsely will claim
Let him curse my name
On these blood stained pages of misery
Let him call me a tyrant so cruel
Let him curse my name
But remember the truth
So there they come
 From everywhere
They witness revenge
Hear them calling
"You're laden with blood
It's spilled everywhere
And sorrow's everlasting
Oh you'll be aware now
That trial is near
It's close at hand
The masquerade is over
It ends
Remove his crown
and bring him down
Now we shall mourn no longer
Our prayers they've been heard
There's no more league
That will bind us to the tyrant
Our voices shall be heard
Cause we won't take it anymore
And we're one we are the nation
And we're one we are the law"
Falsely they praise
Deify his majesty
"He's blessed the anointed's
Fulfilling god's will"
Curse them all
No further he's king
Providence brought him straight into our hands
Let him curse my name
On these blood stained pages of misery
Let him call me a tyrant so cruel
Let him curse my name But remember the truth
Now let him appear
There's joy in the air
Now witness a new age is dawning
In trouble alone
He's facing despair
Awaiting his bitter ending
We all know he's guilty as charged
By punishment due to his crime
We sacrifice the wicked king
Acknowledged by scriptures and law
Let him curse my name
On these blood stained pages of misery
Let him call me a tyrant so cruel
Let him curse my name But remember the truth
On these blood stained pages of misery
Let him call me a tyrant so cruel
Let him curse my name But remember the truth
We won't take it anymore
Our voice it shall be heard
But I will remember the truth
We won't take it anymore
Our voice it shall be heard
But I will remember the truth
Valkyries
To the gods of the north, I pray
And raise my cup for the fallen ones
Then I cry
In Valhalla they'll sing
Rain
Red blood keeps pouring down
Come Valkyries, join me on that final ride
Here I lie bleeding
Odin, I await thee
The battle rages on
New lines they're weaving
The future, the past and the present
They're one
They will reveal their mask
To show me a way to survive
This bitter war
Soon it will be over
He will be the one
We'll weave in
And terror will now rule these lands
When the battle is lost
And the slain ones are chosen
Valkyries will guide us home
When the battle is lost
And the slain ones are chosen
Valkyries will guide us home
Destiny
A spinning wheel
The path of glory
Round and round
come join us
On your final ride to Asgard
Let's move on fast
allfather waits
So let's heed the final call
For now
We leave this world behind
It's over
All glory to the brave
Still blood will rain
Through storm and fire
Let war winds reign
It's the feast for the crows
Follow the light
Just follow the light
Or fade away
Soon it will be over
He will be the one
We'll weave in
and terror will now rule these lands
When the battle is lost
And the slain ones are chosen
Valkyries will guide us home
When the battle is lost
And the slain ones are chosen
Valkyries will guide us home
We'll keep on weaving
We're crushing through lines
With our battering swords
We're marching on
Assign the brave
To survive
This bitter war
Soon it will be over
He will be the one
We'll weave in
And terror will now rule these lands
When the battle is lost
And the slain ones are chosen
Valkyries will guide us home
When the battle is lost
And the slain ones are chosen
Valkyries will guide us home
We'll heed the final call
A call to arms
The valkyries will guide us home
The finally I hear them say
Carry on
For Valhalla awaits you
Control The Divine
For what I was
I'm doomed to be
The tempter and the secret foe
Cause I am hell and hell is me
Pure hate will grow
Still I claim to be the chosen one and
still I claim
This is rebellion rising
First amongst equals
We're bound to no law
There's no one before us
Ethereal sons
Now disobey
Awake and arise
You'll be free
How can we take it away
From someone who has no right?
No right to control the divine
Night shall invade
Suspicion awakes
Wherefore he's grater than I
Stay silent
Until the end of the world
So just like slaves we may deem him
Dead silence
Until the end of the world
Hence from this moment we're doomed
I feel
It hurts though
Disburdened spirits we will be
I've learned my lesson
Pure and sore
And offer divine
We're far beneath them
They consider us slaves
They steal our pride
Don't trust them blindly
Cause truth they conceal
As it seems
I'll reign
Cause here in my tower
Impassioned, I'll show you a way
I can feel your hallowed rage
Now enter my realm
Awake and arise, you'll be free
How can we take it away
 From someone who has no right?
No right to control the divine
Night shall invade
Suspicion awakes
Wherefore he's grater than I
Descend - just keep moving
all things shall proceed
It's freedom you're choosing
Preserve our hate
Eternalize
Awake and arise
To be free
How can we take it away
From someone who has no right?
No right to control the divine
Night shall invade
Suspicion awakes
Wherefore he's grater than I
How can we take it away
From someone who has no right?
No right to control the divine
Night shall invade
Suspicion awakes
Wherefore he's grater than I
War Of The Thrones
Nothing will grow here
Icy fields - blackened sorrow
Legacy of a lost mind
Feed my void
What you're waiting for
I'm too late
It is more than a game
The river reveals
Now I'm in between these lines
I cannot escape it seems
Sail on, my friend
All I ever feel is
All I ever see is
Walls they fall
When the march of the Others begins
All I ever feel is
All I ever see is
Rise and fall
When the War of the Thrones shall begin
While I sit there in silence
Come and talk to me
I can't free my mind
It is all I'm begging for
While I sit there in silence
Will it ever end?
Will I find what I'm longing for?
Will I ever walk out of shadows so grey?
I'm condemned, I am hallowed
Icy fields they won't hurt anymore
Will you walk with me?
Any further
There at world's end
It's me
I sing
I cannot escape it seems
Sadly I sing
All I ever feel is
All I ever see is
Walls they fall
When the march of the Others begins
All I ever feel is
All I ever see is
Rise and fall
When the War of the Thrones shall begin
Away
Watch the river it flows
Now and ever
I cannot believe in more
And now my time will come
Carry on
Will I ever learn from the past?
Will I fade away?
Will I ever stay where the shadows will grow?
There is luck at the gallows
I will free my mind
Soon it will show
Let it rain
There'll be no spring
My dream is a mirror
It reveals a matter of lies
All I ever feel is
All I ever see is
Rise and fall
When the War of the Thrones will begin
All I ever feel is
All I ever see is
Rise and fall
When the War of the Thrones has begun
Leave a fee for the tillerman
And the river behind
A Voice In The Dark
A sense of denial
Come witness my trial
The crow has turned into a liar
I'll live, I may die
I've failed though I've tried
But finally I fly
It is the fool
Who puts faith in false saviors
The innocent understands
He's still falling
And furthermore
He's now aware
“Come spread your wings
Awake now”
The enemy within
Will soon appear
You're trapped in my mind
Ask for the key
Don't search for fine lines
There's no release
Though I can feel its presence
There's a sign to reveal
Then after all
I'm sure I'll keep on falling
They send a sign
When dead winter will come again
There from the ruins I will rise
Fear the voice in the dark
Be aware now
Believe in dark wings and dark words
The shadow returns
Fear the voice in the dark
Be aware now
Black shadows they hide and they wait
But they soon will return
It will never be the same
And nothing remains
I can't find a way
But I'm facing it
Oh there will be no savior
I can foresee all the pain
They are about to creep in
“Curse me, hate me, hurt me, kill me”
Oh they will rest no longer
“Paralyzed and frozen
Free your mind
You're broken
Paralyzed and frozen
Learn to roam
Don't look back”
On stunning fields of mayhem
I will find no relief
It's just a dream
I wish that I could tell you
The vision fades
There is no sanctuary
What will go up
Surely comes down
Fear the voice in the dark
Be aware now
Believe in dark wings and dark words
The shadow returns
Fear the voice in the dark
Be aware now
Black shadows they hide and they wait
But they soon will return
In vain
Still I don't understand
So talk to me again
Why do I fear these words?
What keeps holding me back?
I hear a voice
It comes from everywhere
“Now find a way
Cause you're the key
Begin to understand”
The descending ends
Now I know I won't fly again
On through the mist, I'm facing ground
Fear the voice in the dark
Be aware now
Believe in dark wings and dark words
The shadow returns
Fear the voice in the dark
Be aware now
Black shadows they hide and they wait
But they soon will return
Wheel Of Time
Now there is no end
The wheel will turn, my friend
I'm in flames
Cause I have touched the light
It pulls me son
we shall be one
Forevermore
That's all I want
It's all I need
Everything is fixed
There's no chance
There's no choice
It's calling me
"Saidin"
So precious and sweet
My mind keeps fading away
It's scratching deeper
My sole reliever
How can I find you now?
Passing through the flames
I see
How terror will rise
It soon will be over
Oh Father of lies
Like foul winds at twilight
It's coming over me
What was and what will be?
What is?
I don't know
Driving me insane
Just feel the heat
Madness creeps in
I'll tear it down
There's no end
Wheel of time
It keeps on spinning
There's no beginning
Turn the wheel of time
There's no beginning
Just keep on spinning
Light - it binds me
Light - it blinds me
Light - it finds me
Light denies me now
I creep along
So desperate and tired
Let me ask you
Why?
I am what I am
Prophecies I am the chosen
"Taveren"
The flame will grow
Feel the heat
I'll keep on breathing
After all there's no tomorrow
Wheel of time
Save my soul, find a way
And if I fail, will it all be over
Oh wheel of time
The vision
So fleeting and vague
Once again I will bring down the mountain
One last glimpse
It is constantly slipping away
The young man said
"I will never give up"
The inner war
I can hold against it
My mind, my mind
My mind's in darkness
The young man says
"I will never give in"
The prophecy Behold It's true
I conquer the flame
To release the insane
I'm crying
I cannot erase
I'm the dragon reborn
and in madness
I soon shall prevail
Twice I'll be marked and
Twice I shall live
The heron sets my path
And name me true
Twice I'll be marked and
Twice I shall die
My memory's gone
But twice I pay the price
wheel of time
Save my soul
find a way
May it be as the pattern has chosen
Oh, wheel of time
Turn the wheel of time
It keeps on spinning
There's no beginning
There's no end, wheel of time
There's no beginning
Just keep no spinning
Shine on
Embrace and deny me
Turn on, wheel of time
Shine on
You've burnt, now guide me
Weave on, wheel of time
Oh wheel of time
You're The Voice
We have
The chance to turn pages over
We can write what we want to write
We gotta make ends meet before we get much older
We're all someone's daughter
We're all someone's son
How long can we look at each other
Down the barrel of a gun?
You're the voice try and understand it
Make a noise and make it clear
Whoa oh oh
We're not gonna sit in silence
We're not gonna live with fear
Whoa oh oh
This time
We know we all can stand together
We have the power to be powerful
Believing we can make it better
We're all someone's daughter
We're all someone's son
How long can we look at each other
Down the barrel of a gun?
You're the voice try and understand it
Make a noise and make it clear
Whoa oh oh
We're not gonna sit in silence
We're not gonna live with fear
Whoa oh oh
Curse My Name - Demo
Welcome to my world and then see me there.
The glory that no one denies.
You've conquered death, that's all I know.
All my love long run down.
Bring in the lion, the wizard and king.
Bring out the dead or the loved ones.
'Cause I know we all live a lie.
Where do they really belong?
We're living a life of glorious dreams.
The once and future king.
Let them curse my name
on these bloodstained pages of misery.
And the torment will never let loose.
Let them curse my name
and remember the truth.
Down below where the stories are flying high
they watch your step and then fly back to me.
All my magic's fulfilled in rhymes.
Rearranged for the way.
So I'll let you feel the way for a while,
but I will not let you down.
Alone I want to be, there's no sign of Avalon.
The elder, they all know, there's no sign of Avalon.
No tomorrow I will sing.
No tomorrow I will sing.
There I walk.
I'm afraid it's not on me.
Walk in the shadows.
My piper will come.
Curse the wind. They know my name.
Lovers don't go there, these passes to me.
Let them curse my name
on these bloodstained pages of misery.
And tomorrow will never come true.
Let them curse my name
and remember the truth.
They don't like to see.
They don't want to be.
Don't ask me what they long for.
Suddenly time runs backwards.
All my magic's fulfilled in rhymes.
Rearranged for the way.
So I'll let you feel the way for a while,
but I will not let you down.
Now I know we all live a lie,
no matter her whithering wings.
And while we walk in pouring rain
life's passing by.
Let them curse my name
on these bloodstained pages of misery.
Let them turn all the pages we knew.
Let them curse my name
and remember the truth.
The death of the king will come.
For all that I knew you would come.
It's part of the bigger seed
but we will stand proud
to my beloved time.
Tanelorn Demo
We travel in silver and gold.
We're coming from the land of the iron.
A tortured mask of the wise I behold.
My story has never been told.
Into the fire.
Curse me.
Beware.
Into the fire.
Everything's gone.
This time the battle we have won,
but we are lost 'cause we have chosen.
Take me to the tower of the universe.
Give them back to places where I should have gone.
Please let me cry for everyone.
Do not fear their voices.
Cry for everyone.
Do not fear your choices.
We have enough.
We have enough.
Feeling their voices come so clean.
Cry for everyone.
I feel I'm falling down into the storm.
Look at the siren.
I trust the fire is not what it seems.
When terror is raging.
I am not alone.
Here on my own I've left the world on fire.
Here on my own I'm wasting life so sweet.
My shadow soul, my war cry.
Someone gets near.
Deceiver.
Deceiver.
Now look at the siren.
I've turned to fire, it's raging my soul.
Terror is raging even more.
Now I cry for everyone.
Do not fear their voices.
Cry for everyone.
Do not fear your choices.
We have enough.
We have enough.
Fading, their voices come so clean.
Cry for everyone.
I feel I'm falling down into the storm.
We travel in silver and gold.
We're coming from the land of the iron.
A torture-ridden past from the wise I behold. 
My story has never been told.
Into the fire.
Tell me.
Live on.
Into the fire.
Everything's gone.
Inside the fire.
I'm called through desire.
Don't brave the children of the dark.
Please let me cry for everyone.
Do not fear their voices.
Cry for everyone.
Do not fear your choices.
We have enough.
We have enough.
Fading, their voices come so clean.
Cry for everyone.
I feel I'm falling down into the storm.
Believer.
I'm damned.
Believer.
The Voice In The Dark - Demo
Believe what I'm saying.
We all await
the shattering mind of our saviour.
We live then we die.
I won't deny.
How can't you see my mind?
Fools to believe.
Now I run to the island.
The innocent in the end.
Now I'm falling.
From far beyond and everyone.
Hear now the lord of twilight.
Awaken them.
We passed, there's no one there.
You're trapped in my mind.
Ask for release.
Don't search for fine lines.
Ask for release.
In after-realms I fall down.
There's no sign of release.
I don't believe our saviour will not tell you.
Descending here and the whole world will cry again.
The fallen angel's time to rise.
Fear the man in the dark.
He is calling.
When shadows they reign on the field
their kingdom will come.
Fear the man in the dark.
He is calling.
When shadows they reign on the field
their kingdom will come.
Would you have to find for me
a song to be sung.
No more hiding, I can't find in it.
Oh, you will be my saviour.
I've conquered fear
and I know it's my inner sleeper.
Hit me, nail me, kill me, fear me.
I know it's my inner sleeper.
Shattering the forest.
Darknest soul to harvest.
Shattering the forest.
Darknest soul call my name.
In after-realms I fall down.
There's no sign of release.
I don't believe our saviour will not tell you.
Descending here and the whole world will cry again.
The fallen angel's time to rise.
Fear the man in the dark.
He is calling.
When shadows they reign on the field
their kingdom will come.
Fear the man in the dark.
He is calling.
When shadows they reign on the field
their kingdom will come.
I'm you.
You find me on your way.
There's nothing more to say.
You find me in travelling wake of the past.
Tales so wrong, they come from everywhere.
Now call the spirit of the past
and we will find its heart.
Descending here and the whole world will cry again.
The fallen angel's time to rise.
Fear the man in the dark.
He is calling.
When shadows they reign on the field
their kingdom will come.
Fear the man in the dark.
He is calling.
When shadows they reign on the field.
I'm the Dragon reborn.
