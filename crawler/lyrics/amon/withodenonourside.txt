Blood gushes from the wound
The cut is wide and deep
And before I turn around
He falls to his knees

A clear song rings in the blade
When steel meets hardened steel.
I hear the sound of wood that breaks,
A swords cuts through my shield.

I drop the shield and grab my axe,
A weapon in each fist.
The first blow makes the helmet crack,
The axe cut to the teeth.

I rip the axe from the head,
covered in blood and brains.
Leave the body lying dead,
Ready to strike again.

My sword cuts through clothes and skin,
Like a hot knife cuts through snow.
I smile as the bastard screams,
when I twist my sword.

Sword in my hand,
Axe on my side.
Valhall awaits,
Soon I will die.
Sword in my hand,
Axe on my side.
Valhall awaits me,
When I die.
Bear skin on my back,
Wolf jaw on my head.
Valhall awaits me
When I'm dead.

I raise my axe above my head,
My eyes stare in furious rage.
Yet more blood will be shed,
This is a victorious day!

Blood gushes from the wound,
The cut is wide and deep.
As I turn around,
I fall to my knees.

Sword in my hand,
Axe on my side.
Valhall awaits,
Soon I will die.
Sword in my hand,
Axe on my side.
Valhall awaits me,
When I die.
Bear skin on my back,
Wolf jaw on my head.
Valhall awaits me
When I'm dead.


2. Runes To My Memory


We rode the rivers of the Eastern trail,
Deep in the land of the Rus'.
Following the wind in our sails,
And the rhythm of the oars.
No shelter in this hostile land,
Constantly on guard.
Ready to fight and defend
Our ship 'til the bitter end.

We came under attack,
I received a deadly wound.
A spear was forced into my back
Still I fought on.

When I am dead,
Lay me in a mound.
Raise a stone for all to see
Runes carved to my memory

Now here I lay on the river bank
A long, long way from home
Life is pouring out of me
Soon I will be gone.

I tilt my head to the side
And think of those back home
I see the river rushing by
Like blood runs from my wound.

Here I lie on wet sand,
I will not make it home.
I clinch my sword in my hand,
Say farewell to those I love.

When I am dead,
Lay me in a mound.
Place my weapons by my side
For the journey to Hall up high
When I am dead,
Lay me in a mound.
Raise a stone for all to see
Runes carved to my memory


3. Asator


Thunder rolls across the plains,
Thor rides in pouring rain.
He rides to Jotumheim to fight
Lightning strikes when Mjölner bites.

Fire! Burning in his eyes
Fire! His hate is pure, see the lightning strike
Fire! Burning in his eyes
Fire! His hate is pure, see the lightning strike

Lightning cracks the blackened sky,
Hear the thunder chariot ride
All brave men with hearts of war
Ride the path of mighty Thor

Son of thunder!
Lighting strikes
Son of thunder!
Son of thunder!
Thor Arise!
Son of thunder!

Son Of Oden
Thundergod
Master of War
Asator!

[Solo Söderberg]

Fire! Burning in his eyes
Fire! His hate is pure, see the lightning strike
Fire! Burning in his eyes
Fire! His hate is pure, see the lightning strike


4. Hermod's Ride To Hel - Lokes Treachery Part 1


[Hermod:]
Ride Sleipner
Ride for all you're worth
Faster then lightning,
To the dark realms of the world

Through valleys of darkness
On our way to Nifelheim
To the halls of Hel
Where my brother waits

Wailing voices on the wind
Urging me to turn
Distant tortured screams
Cold blue fires burn

I hear the sound of river Gjoll
Running cold and deep
It's a golden bridge shines in the dark
The bridge that Modgud keeps

Over the bridge, on through the night
Hel is getting near
There are the gates, towering high
Afflicting me with fear

In her hall, at the honor seat
My brother sits in pain
Pale and tortured Balder greats
Bound by invisible frozen chains

[Hermod:]
I have come, to bring him back with me
The whole world mourns his death!
Please set Balder free
Give him back his breath!

[Hel:]
If it's true, what you say to me
That the whole world mourns his death.
If the whole world will weep I'll give him back his breath!


5. Gods Of War Arise


Darkness flees the rising sun
The village lies ahead
It will wake to a new day soon
Soon they all be dead

We came in cover of moonless night
Fifty man at arms
Now at first morning light,
The church bell sound the alarm

Sacrifice to Gods of old
Bleed them of their lives
Fresh blood on our swords
Gods Of War Arise!

Sacrifice to Gods of old
Bleed them of their lives
Fresh blood on our swords
Gods Of War Arise!

Hear the tortured screams
Shattering the air
They awake the soothing dreams
Into their worst nightmare

Fire sweeps their homes
They feel the dragons breath
Consuming and destructive flames
Agonising death

Some seek shelter in the church
A refuge for those with faith
But we know how to smoke them out
A pyre will be raised

But those who choose to stand and fight
Will die with dignity
For the unfortunate few who survive
Waits a life in slavery

The day draws to an end
The night comes dark and cold
We return to our ships
With silver, slaves and gold

We gave them agony, as they fell and die
The gods have granted victory
For our sacrifice

The day draws to an end
The night comes dark and cold
We return to our ships
With silver, slaves and gold
We gave them agony
As they fell and die
The Gods have granted victory
For our sacrifice


6. With Oden On Our Side


Finally the storm arrives
Out wait is at an end
Under dark winter skies
We make our final stand

For each of us, there are four of them
It matters not to us
We won't leave this field in shame
We are here to crush!

[x2]
Futile to resist
You know why we have come
Futile to resist
The battle is already won!

Our hearts are full of pounding rage
Our mind hard as steel
Right before the dying day
We will have you kneel

The snow turns red from all the blood
Severed limbs and heads
A sacrifice to one-eyed God
He will claim the dead!

Under the winter skies
We stand glorious!
And with Oden on our side
We are victorious!

No retreat, no remorse
Victory will be ours
Blood on steel, sacrifice
Victory will be ours

Under the winter skies
We stand glorious!
And with Oden on our side
We are victorious!

[x2]
Futile to resist
You know why we have come
Futile to resist
The battle is already won!


7. Cry Of The Black Birds


Raise your swords up high!
See the black birds fly!
Let them hear your rage!
Show no fear!
Attack!

Charge your horses across the fields
Together we ride into destiny
Have no fear of death, when it's your time
Oden will bring us home when we die!

The ground trembles under us
As we make our thunder charge
The pounding hooves strikes blinding fear
Into their heart

Our helmets shine in the sun
As we near their wall of shields
Some of them turn and run
When they hear our frenzied screams

Draw your swords to strike
Hear the Black Birds cry!
Let them feel your hate!
Show no fear!

(Attack! Attack! Attack! Attack!)

Charge your horses across the fields
Together we ride into destiny
Have no fear of death, when it's your time
Oden will bring us home when we die!

The enemies are in disarray
Ride them down as they run
Send them to their violent graves,
Don't spare anyone
Dead and wounded lie all around,
See the pain in their eyes
Over the field an eerie sound,
As we hear the ravens' cry


8. Under The Northern Star


The icy winter is creeping near
Dark skies above us
Biting frost in the air
Darkness surrounds us

The cold piercing autumn breeze
Fills the longships sail
Soon the lakes and seas will freeze
And snow will lay its veil

Many years we've been away
Many oceans we have roamed
Now the North star guides us on our way
As we are heading home

The many hardships we've endured
Have brought us rich reward
Now the North star guides us home
With cargo full of gold

Many friends died on the way
Only few of us survived
But I would gladly take their place
In Odens hall up high

[Solo: Söderberg]

The icy winter is creeping near
Dark skies above us
Biting frost in the air
Darkness surrounds us

Soon the lakes and seas will freeze
And snow will lay its veil
And we will long for the summer breeze
Where we can set our sails


9. Prediction Of Warfare


Ships were prepared
Weapons and shields
Sails were raised
We headed out to sea!

Norway disappeared in the east
Our journey had begun
Helpful winds gave us our speed
Under a warming sun

Heading to the emerald land
A fleet of 50 ships
An army of two thousand men lead by the king

On the horizon dark clouds arose
Thor rode across the black clouds
As the night rolled in over us
We felt the wrath of the storm

That night I was haunted by dreams
An omen, of what was to come
The serpent arose from the sea

Ready to strike
With hammer in hand
The serpent in pain,
twisting in furious rage!
Fought for its life
The serpent escaped
Thor was in rage
My dreams began to fade

Woke from dreams
Sword in my hand
The break of dawn
We were closing in on Irish land
Time to attack
Grabbed our shields
We came ashore
And saw the waiting horde

The fight was short and deadly intense
The Irish fought us well
But as we gained the upperhand
Their fighting spirit quelled

Ready to strike
With swords in our hands
They struggle with heart
The Irish fell to our wrath
Fought for his life
Their king escaped
With fury divine
King Olaf threw his sword


10. Where Silent Gods Stand Guard (Live At Wacken)


[bonus disk track]

The last head falls to the ground
No one is left alive
They thought that they could take me down
But it's not my time to die
I wipe the blood from my sword
And slide it in my belt
This is the sweetest of rewards
The best rush I have felt
Ten men are dead by my feet
I smell their streaming blood
And I smile, cause it makes me...
...makes me feel so good
They were crawling on their knees
Begging for their pathetic lives
Now their souls belong to me
As well as their eyes
Each man has something that I crave
I eat their steaming eyes
And drink their blood to make them my slaves
At Oden's feat in afterlife
I bring the skulls to my shrine
Where silent Gods stand guard
Soak them in blood and in wine - A sacrificial ritual
One thousand heads are on display
Collected through years of thirst
Macabre trophies from my prey
Picked clean of flesh by Oden's birds
I am - I am - A wolf in human shape
I am - I am - A predator with flaming rage

[Lead Mikkonen]

I'm a wolf in human shape - Every man is prey
A predator with flaming rage - Blood is in my trace
I will die with sword in hand
And then my seat's secured
When Oden calls from golden hall
He will greet me at the door


11. Death In Fire (Live At Wacken)


[Bonus disk track]

The wait is soon at end
Always charge never bend
Morning is here, make your stand
Live for honor, glory, death in fire!
Total war is here
Face it without fear
Age of sword, age of spear
Fight for honor, glory, death in fire!
See the fire rise
Flames are raging high
Soon all will burn and die
Burn for honor, glory, death in fire!
Storm of lethal flames
Only death remains
Ragnarok is closing in
Die for honor, glory, death in fire!
Forces of chaos is on the move
Everyone, choose your side
And know the end is coming soon
The day for all to die
The day is here when Bifrost breaks
Nor sun or moon will rise
When the dead rise from their graves
and Surtur spreads his fire
All you know will wither away
And sink into the sea
A new world will be born one day
Where everyone is free

[Lead Söderberg]

Total war is here, face it without fear
Age of sword, age of spear
Fight for honor, glory, death in fire!
Storm of lethal flames
Only death remains - Ragnar?k is our fate
Die for honor, die for glory
Die, death in fire!

13. Hermod's Ride To Hel - Lokes Treachery Part 1 (Demo)


[bonus disk track]

thunder ride
make your time
ride for all you have
the enemy of mortal men
No time to loose
Eternal time above me
evil in the dark
as they ride to neiflheim
to bring their brother back
wailing voices haggle the wind
begging me to turn
distant tortured voices scream
cold blue fires burn
I hear the sound of river Gjoll
running cold and deep
its golden bridge burns in the dark
the bridge that Modgud keeps

over the bridge
on through the night
Hel is getting near
there are the gates towering high
I'm broken without fear
in her hall at the honor seat
my brother sits in gloom
pale and tortured baulder greets
bearing a face of doom
Oh!!!!!!

I have come to bring him back with me
the whole mourns his death
we beg of you
set baulder free
give him
back his breath

if its true
what you say to me
that the whole world mourns his death
then ill take in the whole worlds whim
I will give him back his breath


14. Once Sent From The Golden Hall (Sunlight Recording)


[bonus disk track]

Rumbling thunder cracks the sky
And rain starts pouring down
Lightning strikes a cold bright light
Upon the blooddrenched ground
The sword play is hard
And many fall
Steel bites sharp in flesh
And upon a mountain
Towering tall
Stand the messengers of death
Five horsemen in armour bright
Waiting in the flashing light
Looking down upon the field
Where Vikings fight with axe and shield
On stallions black as night
With eyes burning red
They ride with thunder to the fight
Deliverance of certain death
A warcry loud as Heimdall's horn
Echoes across the land
Enemies who hear it freeze to the bone
Friends of doom proudly stand
They ride faster than the wind
With lightning speed they strike
Black ravens follow where they've been
To feed from those who died
With power they wield their swords
As they ride down fleeing men
Sending them to Hel's dark court
To never come back again
The warriors ride once more
To the mountain from which they came
Once sent by the gods to war
And they never return in shame
