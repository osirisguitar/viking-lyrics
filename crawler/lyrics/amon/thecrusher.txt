Bastards of a lying breed
You've ruled us for too long
Truth to you are lies to me
And your right is so wrong

Moral preached by immoral fucks
All I feel is despise
Lie no more you fucking cunts
You tare me up inside

Your sons die from your abuse
But you're giving us the blame
The easy path's the one you choose
That road will lead to pain
You're trying to control their mind
And strip them of free will
They way you force them to go blind
Will surely get them killed

My mind is free and so is my soul
You can't put me in chains
I won't play the well-adjusted role
Or bow my head in shame

So throw your stones of guilt at me
Point your finger, Curse my name!
Your scapegoat I will never be
I won't take the blame!

Now we're on trial to serve your crime
And pay for your mistakes
There is no way we'll do the time
The chains of lies will break
Censorship can't stop our truth
We speak straight from the heart
There is nothing you can do
We'll tare your souls apart

So see us rise we're few but strong
We'll crack your fucking teeth
And feed you with your twisted tongue
Until you cannot breathe

The fury makes our eyes see red
It burns within our hearts
Soon you'll all be stone cold dead
We'll tare your souls apart!


2. Masters Of War


STRIKE!
Fast and hard, show no mercy for these men
The vermin of Christ, prophets of lies and their disciples
Seek them out, hunt them down
Break their spirits, crush their hearts
Not even death will set them free from this pain

CHARGE!
Ride them down as they flee from our steel
Draw their blood, make them suffer
Before they die by war-field sacrifice
Wipe them out! Burn their homes and fields
Feed the wolves with their offspring, annihilate them all!

Masters of War, torment every soul
Rape every whore that carries the cross

FIRE!
Burn them all, burn them alive
Send their souls to Deathqueen's hall
To the land of cold burning flames
Send them to the land of famine and despair
Eternally they will starve and freeze


3. The Sound Of Eight Hooves


He's running through the woods so black
A loyal servant of Christ
Dogs are barking down his back
He's running for his life

He came with words of love and peace
These heathens had to be saved
He thought that he could make them see
Instead he was enslaved

In captivity he spoke of god
To all he met he preached
But when his master's patience ran out
He knew he had to flee

Tears are running down his cheeks
As he sobbign realizes
That in this land his god is weak
And today he's going to die

He stumbles out onto an open field
Where an old oak tree grows
In the branches hang men of three
Dressed in preacher robes

His knees refuse to carry him on
Terror shines in his eyes
His faith in Christ is almost gone
His god's left him to die
Below the dead he says his prayers
To the god he thought was alive
When he hears a calm voice say:
"SHUT HIM UP AND HANG HIM HIGH!"

As his breath leaves his eyes open wide
A bright light comes from above
He greets this light with a smile
And thinks: "There is a God"

The sound of eight hooves reaches his ears
Comes from the heavenly light
Two wolves' howls fill his heart with fear
And he sees two ravens fly
Down from the sky a warlord rides
Like fire his one eye glows
And just before the preacher dies
He knows his god is false


4. Risen From The Sea 2000


Risen from the sea
The beast of hell is here
He's come to rule the earth
Kneel and obey his power

A second beast rises
Rises from the earth
Followed by an army
An army of immortals
An army of the dead

Second beast breaks from the earth
Kneel and obey his power
Fire in the rocks
Fire from the sky
Kneel and obey

Kneel or die!!
Kneel or die!!

There is wisdom with him
Who hath understanding reckon
The number of the beast for it is
A number of a man its number
Is six hundred sixty six, 666

He's risen from the sea
The beasts of hell are here
Come to rule the world
And you will be in fire

So it is written, So it has been
The beast is here, to rule the world
So it is written, So it has been
The beast is here, to rule the world

So it is written, So it has been
The beast is here, to rule the world
So it is written, So it has been
The beast is here, to rule the world


5. As Long As The Raven Flies


Men will fight and men will die
Wars will be lost and won
That's how it's been and still will be
Long after I'm gone

Doubting not I give my blood
So I may enter hall up high
The sky belongs to Asagods
As long as the raven flies


6. A Fury Divine


Death is drawing near
I know it's true but I have no fear
I know I can't escape my:

FATE! Turns it's deadly wheel
Judgement day is closing in but still I cannot feel:

REMORSE! Is for the weak
I stand silent while they speak, their accusations are all:

LIES! Spread by preaching men
I'm on trial for being who I am
And praising the Gods of my native land

I will stand firm, I refuse to kneel
The fury in me is divine
My dark grave awaits, my fate is revealed
But I'm not afraid to die

Death! The day to die is here
The sun rides high on the northern sphere
And the executioner sharpens his:

Axe! Shines in the sun
I smile when they tie me down
And hear the sound of the falling blade
Death! Sweet death, relieve me from this world
Death! Sweet death, relieve me, relieve:

So death finally came to him
The pagan man could not be turned
He faced death with a grin
Now his head rests in the dust

The proud man stood firm, he refused to kneel
Then fury in him was divine
Now he is dead, his fate has been sealed
He's brought to Golden Hall up high


7. Annihilation Of Hammerfest


All is lost and foreign kings
Rule the northern realms
Hammerfest, the last outpost
Has fallen to unbearded men

Lords of the bloody cross
Deceived or murdered all of true faith
Now the temple of Thor, where Mjolner is kept
Is under siege

They fear the power of Mjolner
The hammer of Thor
And all their efforts to destroy it have failed

From deep within the frozen ground
Comes a rumbling sound
Ravens fly and wild wolves howl
Sending shivers down Christians' spines

As if from nowhere
Dark and grim he appears
The warlord of the Gods comes with force
To retrieve The Crusher

The first man died with a gurgling sigh
When his head was crushed
Painful surprise in his eyes
As his life was snuffed

With raw and brutal force
The warlord breaks the temple doors
The weak back off in fear
On the altar it lies, he lifts the hammer high
And before it he swears:

`Allvise Ygg, Maktige Harjafader
Guda av Asars och vaners att
Hor mina ord, nar som jag svar
Att om tusen vintrar ater ta var ratt?

While he speaks his prayer
Mjolner rests in the air
As if holding breath

Frozen by fear
They gathered stand and stare
And what they see is death

A laughing cry fill the shivering night
He lets the hammer strike
A bolt of lightning bright
Rips the darkened sky
Fire of doom - Ignite!


8. The Fall Through Ginnungagap


Once I was - Now I am no more
A burst of flames threw me into oblivion

The life I knew - Seems distant and unreal
A fading dream, a memory I can't recall

Am I real - I can no longer tell
A notion tells me I still exist

Infinite dark - Through this void I float
Resting, waiting for the day
When I will live again

Eons pass or maybe I just blinked
Deeper into this hell I sink

Falling through Ginnungagap
I'm pulled towards an unseen gate
I seem to hear my name being called
I float towards these cries of fate

Faster than - the speed of light
I am falling through universe

Stars flash by - Before my eyes
The time has come to return

Out of the dark - Into the light
Back into life I am cast

By my side - A demon army rides
We ride to reclaim that once we lost

Eons have passed, I'm back from the dead
Victory lies ahead


9. Releasing Surtur's Fire


He's riding down 'cross a field familiar but nothing is the same
This place he knew as Hammerfest
When the old Gods reigned
The army of demons rides
By his side with weapons drawn
Today is the day
When Ragnarok will be spawned

There lies the mountain where the temple once stood
Where eons ago he arose to spill their christian blood

Stuck in the rock is a golden ring
That yet no one's dared to touch
The legend has it it's where the Crusher once struck

He pulls the hammer from the mountain's grip
The sign for demons to attack
He's been called upon to arise and he won't spare a single life
No, Thor (won't) spare a single soul, nor let them get away alive
They strike down on the world with overwhelming force
All resistance is brutally crushed, crushed without remorse
Dark angels descend to join the bloodfight
The slaughter brings them on, see Odin's Valkyries ride

The battle of Midgard is almost won
And the thousand years of tyranny will be forever gone
Soon a new world will be born rising from the Sea
Where Asagods again shall reign and humans will be free

He rides once more upon the black mountain of doom
Holding firm the Crusher of giants' bones
He lets the hammer strike, now everything will burn
As Surtur's fire is released upon the world


10. Eyes Of Horror


[Bonus Track]
[originally by Possessed]

Every night I see through eyes
Of a different lunatic
And every night I fantasize
In trancial mesmeric

All alone inside my head
Within my padded cell
Ruled by thoughts of another mind
Controlled by unseen eyes

In my mind I see the sun
Plunge into the sea I listen to my
Tales now I'll tell you what I see
And so the corpses
And the thrill
My mind is warped
Nothing's real

Do I dream
Or is it true
The piercing scream
She never knew

Every night I see through eyes
Of a different lunatic
And every night I fantasize
The eyes of horror
