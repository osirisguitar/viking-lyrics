1. Deceiver Of The Gods


Since I was born they have kept me down,
They have forced me to conform.
I will tear down their holy crown in a vengeful thunder storm,

I loathe their bloody righteous ways
It fills me with despise,
Fuelling flames of violent rage,
I will be their world's demise.

[Chorus:]
Asgård's always been my home
But I'm of different blood
I will overthrow the throne
Deceiver!
Deceiver of the gods!

All this rage, and all this hate,
It burns me deep inside,
And still it is, the only thing, keeping me alive.
Dark ambition within my heart and it's aching to break free
The one true nature of my soul, the giant lives in me.

Kneel!
You all shall kneel to me!
Or death will set you free!
You all shall kneel to me!

Fall!
You all shall fall to me!
Vengeance will be sweet!
You all shall fall to me!

[Chorus:]
Asgård's always been my home
But I'm of different blood
I will overthrow the throne
Deceiver of the gods!

[Chorus:]
Asgård's always been my home
I'm born from different blood
I've come to overthrow the throne
Deceiver!
Deceiver of the gods!
Deceiver of the gods!


2. As Loke Falls


Yeah!

Heimdall gazes east
A sail has caught his eye
He lifts his hand and sounds the horn
The undead army has arrived

Here comes Nagelfar
With Laufey's son on board
He brings chaos, hate and wrath
He brings the war to end all wars

Heimdall knows his fate
The end of all nine worlds
It's what the Vala has foreseen
He knows that everything shall burn

Facing Lopt's deceit
Now they finally meet
The champion and his enemy
On Vigrid's plains they'll find defeat

Their swords meet in a mighty clash
War cries sound, horns they blast
Their eager weapons whip and thrash
This day when all shall end

The lords of war are equal strong
This battle frantic and forlorn
The blades sing a macabre song
This day when all shall end

Heimdall's blade bites burning sharp
As it cuts through flesh and bone
Blood comes gushing from the wound
As Loke's head falls tumbling
Rolling to the burning ground


3. Father Of The Wolf


So he found the heart in barren land
It was beating, still alive
He held it gently in his hand
And looked up to the sky

With evil thoughts of vicious kind
And sinister disdain
His thoughts of bringing back to life
The witch that died in flames

[Chorus 2x:]
Serpent's kin
Born of sin
Dark within
Father of the wolf!

He then devoured Gullveig's heart
And she was born again
They brought to life an evil force
A beast that can't be tamed

With dark deception in his soul
Betrayal of the gods
The bane of Oden now is born
Born of evil blood

[Chorus 2x:]
Serpent's kin
Born of sin
Dark within
Father of the wolf!

They brought to life a malicious force
A vile beast that cannot be tamed
Fimbultýr's nemesis now is born
A vile beast that can't be restrained

Dark!
Deception in his
Soul!
Betrayal of the
Gods!
Oden's bane is
Born!
Born of evil blood!

[Chorus 2x:]
Serpent's kin
Born of sin
Dark within
Father of the wolf

Born of sin


4. Shape Shifter


I was born of giant's blood
Raised in Asgård, the home of gods
I am the master of disguise
For this trait I've gained your prise

Fast in thought, quicker tongue
Brawl with me and you'll get stung
I am the master of deceit
My words bind or set you free

[Chorus:]
I am the walker on the wind
The shape shifter
Two-faced words
And a lying grin
The shape shifter

You call me evil; curse my name
But you only have yourselves to blame
Order needs its anarchy
Balance through calamity

We mixed our blood in olden days
Now I wander like a stray
We were brothers, now estranged
I will have my sweet revenge

My words are poison to your ears
I say the words you fear
Still you know it is the truth you hear
Ragnarök is drawing near

There you sit in Aegir's hall
Waiting for the coming fall
Council of the now condemned
Twilight of both gods and men

Face the facts; you're old and weak
Empty words are all you speak
No escape, there's no return
The universe shall bleed and burn

[Chorus:]
I am the eagle in the sky
The shape shifter
Vicious wolf
Howling in the night
The shape shifter
I am the walker on the wind
The shape shifter
Two-faced words
And a lying grin
The shape shifter
I am the eagle in the sky
The vicious wolf
Howling in the night
I am the walker on the wind
Lying words,
With an honest grin
The shape shifter


5. Under Siege


Outside these walls
An army awaits
But in these halls
We feel safe

Countless attacks
We have repelled
They won't turn back
They cannot be quelled

[Chorus:]
Supplies are running low
Starvation now awaits
Reinforcements will not show
The day is much too late

Broken and weak
Never give in
Prospects are bleak
We can't win

There is no hope
No time for lament
End of the rope
Our lives are spent

We have held out for months
Hoping for relief
Our fortress now our tomb
And salvation now our grief
We have held out for months
Waiting for relief
Our fortune's now our own
This is destiny

[Chorus:]
Supplies are running low
Starvation now awaits
Reinforcements never showed
As the daylight starts to fade
There's nothing left to lose
We have run out of time
There is nothing left to choose
Except how we shall die

Open the gates!
Now we attack!
Ride into fate!
No turning back!

Stand by the King!
To glory we ride!
Weapons and shield!
Together we die!

All is lost now!
Show no fear now!
All the world shall know our bravery!

All is lost now!
Show no fear now!
One last charge for death or victory!


6. Blood Eagle


Yeah!

Look to my burning eyes
Plead for your worthless life
All remorse I had has died
And all I have is hate inside

You took my soul from me
You took my family
You killed them all ferociously
Now this is what I give to thee

[Chorus:]
Carved upon your naked back
Blood eagle!
Skinned alive your ribs are cracked
Blood eagle!
Still alive you gasp for air
As panic strikes your eyes they stare
Terror grips your dying heart
Blood eagle!

Helpless on the ground
Hands and feet tightly bound
In my eyes no mercy found
My sharp knife starts to carve around

Penetrate your naked skin
Rip flesh and dig within
With a pleased and twisted grin
I spread your lungs like eagle's wings

The burning grief is tormenting me
The hate I feel is destroying me
Only vengeance will give me peace
Only vengeance will set my spirit free

[Chorus:]
Carved upon your naked back
Blood eagle!
Skinned alive your ribs will crack
Blood eagle!
Still alive you gasp for air
As panic strikes your eyes will stare
Slow death grips your tortured heart
Blood eagle!
Blood eagle!
Blood eagle!


7. We Shall Destroy


Sword and spear
Wall of shields
Standing strong
On this their chosen battle field

Form the lines
Shield by shield
Side by side
We're marching into destiny

March as one
Don't look back
Oden's sons
Attack!

Unleash hell! Do not repent!
Warfare grants us no lament
Let your weapons slash and tear
This is no place for fear

Hold the lines! Move as one!
In unity our victory's won
Our shields will form a mighty wall
United we shall never fall

Fear will not pierce our hearts
Though swords and arrows will
Victory is our reward
For all the blood we spill
We didn't come to waste our lives
Like pawns in a savage game
Our spirits, spears
And shields are linked
In a much stronger chain

March as one
Don't look back
Oden's sons
Attack!

[2x]
All are one
And one is all
Side by side
The battle calls
All are one
And one is all
Shield by shield
We'll never fall

Unleash hell! Do not repent!
Warfare grants us no lament
Let your weapons slash and tear
This is no place for fear

Charge with force! Break their ranks!
No remorse, crush their flanks!
Pulverize their human wall!
We shall destroy!


8. Hel


Welcome to my humble home
Your soul is mine to keep
There are no walls of rock and stone
Yet no one ever leaves

Those who die of age and plague
Are welcomed in my court
Murderers, miscreants
Will linger here and rot

Those who die inglorious
And those who die in shame
They are all sent to my dark halls
They all shall fear my name

[Chorus:]
Here hunger is your plate
Here famine is your knife
Here you will forever dwell
I welcome you to Hel

I welcome you to Hel

Now here you are in my cold realm
You are my honoured guest
At the banquette of the dead
Your soul will never rest

Your soul is mine to keep.
Your soul is mine to keep.
And you will never leave.
And you will never leave.

[Chorus:]
Here sickness is your bed
Here ruin is your fell
Here you will forever dwell
I welcome you to
Here hunger is your plate
Here famine is your knife
Here you will forever dwell
I welcome you to Hel


9. Coming Of The Tide


Racing 'cross the arctic lands
A mounted legion
Under my command
We're a brutal force
No men can withstand
Total havoc is at hand

[Chorus:]
See the black crows circle high
Waiting for brave men to die
They sense the coming of the tide
When opposition's swept aside

The fateful message
Reached us months ago
That our home was under siege
And since that day
We've been heading north
Our kinsmen needed our relief

As we near our fortress walls
Black smoke is rising to the sky
Burnt black ruins
Of our father's halls
And corpses greet our tired eyes

What madness led them to attack
Victory could not be won
They must've known
There was no turning back
And now they all are gone
No woman, child or man was spared
Their bodies lying where they fell
Suffering, anguish and despair
As they went through living hell

So now we're on the ride again
And vengeance is
Our newfound path
We draw our strength
From grief and pain
These bastards shall know
Our endless wrath

[Chorus:]
See the black crows circle high
Waiting for brave men to die
This is the coming of the tide
When opposition's swept aside


10. Warriors Of The North


We were the warriors of the north
Notorious and brave
We'd never lost a fight in war
We feared not the grave

The ruler of this northern court
My brother, lord, king
He always had our loyal swords
But we would feel his sting

The aging king had no descendants
No heir to take his throne
It filled his soul with fear
Transcendent
That next in line was my first-born

The king's heart grew
Full of dark deception
Full of foul conspiracy
This was when dark days
Had their inception
And we fell to his vile deceit

Robbed of arms, robbed of pride
But he spared our lives
The fear he had of Oden's wrath
Held his vengeful knife

With hearts so cold we left our homes
Banished from our land
A life in shame, a life in grief
Until we rise again

Winters come, winters pass
Twenty wasted years
We're aging men, our youth is gone
We will shed no tears

Winters come and winters pass
Twenty years have gone
Like a dream we fade away
Into oblivion

We are the warriors of the north
Notorious and brave
We're old but strong as before
And we don't fear the grave

From the south an army rises
They ride under cross of gold
From the shades we're called
In a time of crisis
To defend the king now weak and old

As the flames of warfare rage higher
We feel our destiny's embrace
We are aging men of an old empire
Now we can see Valhalla's gates

We!
March again
First in line
To reach Valhalla's mighty gates

We!
March again
March to fight
To reach Valhalla's mighty
We!
March again
Give our lives
To reach Valhalla's
Mighty royal gates"Där tog en nordlig vind
skeppet, så att kungen
ombord fördes med
till strid mot två kungar
De djärva kungarna
Hälsade med pilskott
Ordlöst i striden.
Sköldarnas buller räckte."

Blood red bows plough the waves
Dragon heads grin
Twenty ships with Norsemen braves
Riding the northern wind

They left their shores at early dawn
As a red sun was rising in the east
An ancient sign of coming storm
Thunder of sword and shield

Sails appear in the south
Now every man prepare
The sea will be colored by blood
Battle is drawing near

A mighty fleet of forty ships
Two kings bring lethal steel
No words spoken between enemies
Just thunder of sword and shield

A rain of arrows darkens the sun
A cloud of wood and steel
Through shields and flesh the arrows run
Bringing warriors to their knees

A war-cry loud as heimdal's horn
Fills the vibrating air
This is the place where heroes are born
And where death is always near

Here it comes the mighty storm
Every man attacks
Now is when heroes are born
There is no turning back


2. Where Death Seems To Dwell


"Through a dark and desolate valley he walks
Pale, flickering fires light the way
Along an ice cold river lies his path
The sky is of darkest grey

A cold wind pierce through his bones
And the sharp rocks cut his feet
His clothes and skin are ripped by thorns
His eyes appear to bleed"

The land is dead and dry
The water is poisonous
Unknown creatures howling to the sky
Blood chilling and ravenous

The air is thick and dense
A smell of rotting flesh
Every breath is like one thousand knives
Cutting through his chest

Black birds of prey circle the sky
He hears the shadows moan
He sees pale faces pass him by
But he walks this path alone

Darkness fills his heart with chilling fear
A nameless fear he cannot quell
How did he ever end up here?
This place where death seems to dwell

He repeats the question in his weary mind
The riddle gives him no rest
Yet he knows the answer deep inside
He's been touched by the chill of death

Enchanting voices urge him on
Through he wants to turn around
They sing to him with soothing words
A chilling, frighting sound

A cold blue light shimmer ahead
Where a mountain reaches for the sky
Nidafiell, mountain of the dead
Terrifying it's might

He approach the gates
his heart is cold
He understands all to well
She awaits him
The truth unfolds
He's been sent to Nifelhel


3. The Fate Of Norns


I feel a chill in my heart
Like lingering winter cold
I and my son are torn apart
He was just 6 winters old

My first-born was he
And the last of my kin
The last one to carry my name
Death smiled at him its deadly grin
There is no one for me to blame

The fate of Norns await us all
There is no way to escape
The day to answer Oden's call
Or walk through hel's gate

I carry him to my ship
He seems to be asleep
But the deep blue colour of his lips
Is enough to make me weep

No man should have to bury his child
Yet this has been my share
The tears i shed run bitter and wild
It's a heavy burden to bear

His body feels so light in my arms
His skin is pale as snow
Yet his weight feels heavy in my heart
As my sadness continues to grow

Allfather!
What fate has been given me?
Why must I suffer?
Why must I feel this pain?
Allfather!
LIfe has lost it's meaning to me
I think I'm going insane!

I lay him down on a pyre
A burial worthy a king
And as I lie down by his side
I hear the weaving norns sing

The fate of Norns await us all
There is no way to escape
The day to answer Oden's call
Or walk through hel's gate

The fate of Norns await us all
I know this to be true
It's time to answer Odens's call
My son, he calls for me and you


4. The Pursuit Of Vikings


The warming sun returns again
And melts away the snow
The sea is freed from icy chains
Winter is letting go

Standing on the ocean side
We can hear the waves
Calling us out with tide
To sail into our fate

Oden! Guide our ships
Our axes, spears and swords
Guide us through storms that whip
And in brutal war

Our ships await us by the shore
Time has come to leave
Our country, family and homes
For riches in the east

Some of us won't return
But that won't bring us down
Our fate is written in the web
Woven by the Norns

A ram is sacrificed
Across the longship's bow
And as we set our sails
A strong breeze starts to blow

It carries us out to sea
With hope of fame and pride
And glorious all will be
That with sword in hand will die

Oden! Guide our ships
Our Axes, spears and swords
Guide us through storms that whip
And in brutal war

Oden! Guide our ships
Our axes, spears and swords
Guide us through storms that whip
And in brutal war


5. Valkyries Ride


Soon a new day will be spawned
Scattered fires glow
Soon first blood will be drawn
And dying ambers glow

They await the suns first rays
Anticipation running high
The Norns are counting numbered days
Hear the war-cry rise

See the Valkyries ride!
See the Valkyries ride!

They meet upon this hallowed field
Now the end is near
Two armies not about to yield
The smell of death in the air

This field has served as battle ground
Since the dawn of this world
Through the years a lot of blood
Has been poured into this earth

Warrior's eyes full of purest rage
Steel cutting flesh
Spilling guts and severing heads
Sending men to their death

Ride, ride, ride Valkyries
Ride, ride, ride Valkyries

The screams of dying men
The comfort in their eyes
Here they come, by Oden sent
See the Valkyries ride

Fallen men lie all around
Their dead eyes look to the sky
And as the swordplay rambles on
They see the Valkyries ride


6. The Beheading Of A King


A mighty fleet came across the strait
But Erik was prepared
Five hundred Germans had come to his aid
On horseback with their spears

The fleet was carrying two thousand men
Eager to draw blood
But as they were about to land
Erik released his heards

One thousand men and five hundred horsemen
Came charging down the beach
When the sea-king saw this force
He gave order to retreat

All obeyed except one ship
It held the king's own son
He despised the thought of flight
And attacked on his own

The Danish fleet had to turn around
They charged King Erik's men
But it was too late to save his son
His life was already spent

The fighting continued bloody and fierce
And the bloodshed was immense
Two thousand warriors died that day
Most of them were Danes

The Danish king was captured
Most of his guards were dead
For a ransom he was released
Then his people took his head


7. Arson


They came riding at first light
Fifty men armed to the teeth
The sounding horn called us out to fight
We went to meet them with our steel

Outnumbered yet we fought
But soon we were overrun
We took refuge in our home
Our downfall had just begun

They attacked our home, we kept them out
Defending ourselves with spear and bow
We took them out one by one
As the rising autumn sun glowed

There was twenty dead on each side
When we first smelled something burn
We heard them laughing from outside
Taunting us with spiteful words

They set the house on fire
In order to smoke us out
Only five of us were still alive
And our time was running out

Raging flames surrounded us all
Our home was under siege
Crumbling roof and burning walls
There was no way to break free

As we were all about to die
We swore a sacred oath
Revenge would be claimed if someone survived
And we sealed the oath in blood

The roof caved in and cleared a path
A way out of the flames
It was decided that I'd go first
As we made for our escaped

Suddenly the walls came down
And trapped the rest inside
My closest friends died that day
Only I made it out alive

8. Once Sealed In Blood


It's five years since I left this land
Since I left my friends to burn
Five years making bitter plans
Preparing my return

All this time my hatred's grown
The one thing on my mind
The hate in me is all I've known
The one thing keeping me alive

Bold words spreads across the land
Bragging tongues speak carelessly
Know they not what is to come
I'll hunt them down restlessly

The oath I swore, once sealed in blood
A seal between loyal friends
I swore before ancient Gods
I will have revenge

I swore! Before my Gods!
An oath! Once sealed in blood

I swore! Before my Gods!
An oath! Once sealed in blood

Now here I stand in pouring rain
As he comes riding down the path
He will learn the meaning of pain
As subject to my endless wrath

He will be the first to pay
For the bragging words he spoke
He'll regret that fateful day
My friends perished in smoke

I swore! Before my Gods!
An oath! Once sealed in blood

I swore! Before my Gods!
An oath! Once sealed in blood

I swore! Before my Gods!
An oath! Once sealed in blood
I swore! Before my Gods!
Once sealed in blood
I swore! Before my Gods!
An oath! Before my Gods!
Once sealed in blood
I swore! Before my Gods!

So here I stand on the road
With cold steel in my hand
As he looks into my unforgiving soul
His tears begins to run

One man down 29 to go
Consider yourselves warned
I'm coming for the rest of you
And will have no remorse

The first man I killed was the earl's right-hand man
When he came to take her away
I ran his own sword straight through his throat
And then I stood there, watching him fade

The first blood I spilled was the blood of a varg
I had to wipe his smile away
I was not yet a man, nor was I a boy
But still, I made that bastard pay

So I left him there, on the stable floor
Bathing in a pool of his own blood
My one and only choice was to flee this land
To leave this wretched place for good

I am an outcast
All alone
I'm a nomad without home

I am an outlaw
I'm disowned
And I am no man's son

Through the cold midwinter nights on a southbound winding path
The stars and moon my only light; and the earl's men closing fast
I swore that I'd return; that I would see him burn
I will live it in my dreams; the smell, the blood, his dying screams

To my father I was dead, he took his hand from me
He drove me away, I was shunned
My one and only choice was to leave this land
To become the pagan they would hunt

I am an outcast
All alone
I'm a nomad without home

I am an outlaw
I'm disowned
And I am no man's son

I am an outcast
All alone
I'm a nomad without home

I am an outlaw
I'm disowned
And I am no man's son

I journey through this frozen land on my own
There's no shelter anywhere down the road
When this mystic wanderer comes around
And the dying hope in my heart starts to grow

This vagrant offers help when there was none
To this outlawed murder on the run
Through the snowy mountains we roam
Mu journey towards freedom has now begun

On the run
All alone
Hope is gone
Wanderer

A blizzard hit with blinding force
The wind cut through the bone
And amidst the blur of snow
I found myself alone

Freezing winds brought me down
I laid myself to rest
In the deep, chilling cold
I knew I'd freeze to death

Left alone I had no choice
But to accept my fate
When the wanderer returned
Then I knew that my life was saved

On the run
All alone
Hope is gone
Wanderer

On the run
Not alone
Hope returns
Wanderer

Drifting alone upon the dragon ship
Eerily still, no winds that tear or whip
Silence deafens, the sea is mirror calm
Blood runs like the water from my palm

I'm standing by myself
Abiding
Just me and no one else
No hiding

Horizon crumbles under flaming skies
A shadow screams from thunderclouds up high
Nidhogg comes in winds of burning flames
Cast down war and endless pain

It's coming
Brace myself
I'm ready
It's coming
No escape
Stand steady

Out on this bloody sea I'll face my destiny
Lost in a dreadful dream I'll meet my fate

Out on this blood sea, this is my prophecy
A notion of what's to be, there's no escape

The dragon sweeps down with a roar
Sky and ocean shake
It tears up waves of blood and gore
The longship nearly breaks

Passing just above my head
A stench of putrid death
Rotting flesh of thousands dead
Dwells upon its breath

I turn around
Face myself
Yet it isn't I
With fear and rage
I run me through
As I watch me die!

Out on this bloody sea, I'll face my destiny
Lost in a dreadful dream, I'll meet my fate
Out on this bloody sea, this is my prophecy
A notion of what's to be, there's no escape

Get ready!
Stand steady!

It's coming
Brace myself
Abiding
It's coming
Certain death
No hiding

Winter's lost its grip
The ocean is set free
The ship glides through the broken ice
Out to an open sea

North winds fill the sails
They fly on frothing seas
As hope grows stronger in his heart
It's easier to breathe

Days turn into nights
Nights turn into days
His determination grows
With every breath he takes

There he stands alone, one man against all
With a sword in each hand, soon he will fall
There he stands alone, one man against all
With a sword in each hand, heeding the call

When the reach the Hano bay
There waits a ship of war
Like the bear attacks its prey
It comes at them with force

All men to the oars!
Row for all your worth!
Most likely this will be your last day
On this wretched earth!

The weak they try to run
But he's prepared to fight
One by one his friends are slain
Only he remains

He knows the end is near
They have him in their jaws
When a noble man appears
He tells them, "Withdraw!"

There he stands before him
As the skirmish quells
He offers him,
"Join our crew or join your friends in hell."

There he stands alone, one man against all
With a sword in each hand, and soon he will fall
There he stands alone, one man against all
With a sword in each hand, he's heeding the call

Victory
We fought hard and prevailed
Brutally
We were fighting

Stormy seas
Rolling thunder, piercing hail
Battlefield
Lit by lightning

Eagerly
We filled the waves with enemies
Hungrily
Ravens cawing

Home shore calls
We return on bloody seas
Twilight falls
Darkness crawling

So pour the beer for thirsty men
A drink that they have earned
And pour a beer for those who fell
For those who did not return

Raise your horns!
Raise them up to the sky!
We will drink to glory tonight
Raise your horns for brave fallen friends
We will meet where the beer never ends

No regrets
We went out to war and strife
To protect
King and country

Victory
Honor those who gave their life
Willingly
We will not grieve

So pour the beer for thirsty men
A drink that they have earned
And pour a beer for those who fell
For those who did not return

Raise your horns!
Raise them up to the sky!
We will drink to glory tonight!
Raise your horns!
Raise them up to the sky!
We will drink tonight!

Raise your horns!
Raise them up to the sky!
We will drink to glory tonight
Raise your horns
For brave fallen friends
We will meet in Valhalla again

Whirling dust in morning air
Two warriors in the ring
With the strength of two great bears
They make their weapons sing

Sparks fly high when steel meets steel
And no one can believe
That these two men are best friends
Not enemies

They lash out with ferocious force
The fight grows more intense
But each avoid the other's sword
As if by seventh sense

Their muscles ache, their bones are sore
But none of them will yield
They fight a two-man practice war
As enemies

Faster!
Stronger!
Fight until your dying breath!
Fiercer!
Harder!
This is a matter of life and death!

Full on fight in training
It's the way of vikings
Every muscle straining
It's the way of the Jomsvikings
These men aim to shatter
It's the way of vikings
This is how we battle
It's the way of the Jomsvikings

Whirling dust in morning air
Two warriors in the ring
With the strength of two great bears
They make their weapons sing

Sparks fly high when steel meets steel
And no one can believe
That these two men are best friends
Not enemies

Sun beats down with intense heat
The swordsmen start to break
Pain shoots through their tired feet
With every step they take

In this fight of iron wills
One man takes a knee
The other goes for the kill
Like an enemy

Faster!
Stronger!
Fight until your dying breath!
Fiercer!
Harder!
This is a matter of life and death!

Full on fight in training
It's the way of vikings
Every muscle straining
It's the way of the Jomsvikings
These men aim to shatter
It's the way of vikings
This is how we battle
It's the way of the Jomsvikings

At dawn's first light
Run for your lives

Viking ships come out of the mist
Ominous sight
Flee or stand fast
You won't last

Warlords invade with axe and blade
Attack at first light
Unstoppable force
No remorse

Under attack, no turning back
You cannot run
Nowhere to hide
No shelter inside

Under attack, no turning back
Slaughter's begun
Nowhere to hid
No shelter inside

Slashing, killing
Thrashing, spilling
Blood for honor, death, and glory!

Out of the night
At dawn's first light
Longships arrive
Run for your lives!

Wounds won't mend your bitter end
Death to all
Flee or fight
No one survives

Bloodshed won't stop
'Til the last drop
You will fall
It matters not how hard you fought

Under attack, no turning back
You cannot run
Nowhere to hide
No shelter inside

Under attack, no turning back
Slaughter's begun
Nowhere to hid
No shelter inside

Slashing, killing
Thrashing, spilling
Blood for honor, death, and glory!

The ships bring terror to these shores
Death and all out war
Their oars are cutting through the waves
Like spades are digging graves

At dawn's first light
Run for your lives

Out of the night
At dawn's first light
Longships arrive
Run for your lives!

They bring him to the shore
His ship is ready made
He will not see them anymore
Here he cannot stay

The brotherhood is gathered
Their faces hard as stone
They have come to take farewell
In silence they mourn

"Our king has left our ranks
a wise and noble man
We owe him loyalty and thanks
He ruled with a steady hand

He will be missed by all
His heart has now been stilled
Tonight he'll dine in Odin's Hall
There he'll drink his fill"

The ship glides gently on the waves
As day turns into night
One thousand burning arrows
Fill the starlit sky

Two ravens on the longship
They spread their pitch-black wings
And lift up to the burning sky
A send-off for a king!

Into flames! The longship burst into flames!
Black smoke is rising high
To the eternal night

Into flames! The whole world burst into flames!
Nothing will be the same
Things will forever change

The flames are raging higher
They gnaw at wood and flesh
Soon the ship will break apart
And sink into the depth

This night we wait in silence
And when the morning breaks
Our king has left this world to walk
Through Valhalla's gates

The odds are stacked against me
Outnumbered three to one
These men are seasoned warriors
But I stand my ground

Waiting
Let them come
Ready
Cut them down

No chainmail for protection
I don't have a shield
Surprise my one advantage
Keeping my sword concealed

Hidden
Out of sight
Ready
Prepared to bite

The first man's coming at me
I am not afraid
The time has finally come now
To introduce my blade

Flashing
Fear its name
Slashing
Feel the pain

This is my sword
We are one and the same
My enemies' woe
Vengeance the name

The blade is swift and ruthless
It deals in death and harm
And as he tries to grab me
It cuts through his arm

First cut
Blood is shed
Dripping
Snow turns red

I've struck fear in their hearts
Now let the slaughter start

This is my sword
We are one in the same
My enemies' woe
Vengeance the name
This is my sword
The dealer of pain
Death of my foe
Vengeance the Game

The next man over reaches
And so he winds up dead
One cut is all that's needed
I removed his head

There's only one left standing
He's lost the will to fight
I point my sword towards him
He quickly takes flight

Running
From my sword
Victory
My reward

This is my sword
We are one and the same
My enemies' woe
Vengeance the name
This is my sword
The dealer of pain
Death of my foe
Vengeance my aim

Years of wait are over now
She's almost in my grasp
Now I will fulfill my vow
She will be mine at last

I feel him near
The boy estranged has now returned a full grown man,
But still I fear that nothing's changed
He simply does not understand

Come with me
I'll set you free
And I'll show you
What your life could be

You can't see
That I am free
My life is mine, not yours.
So leave me be

Through forests deep, over mountains high
I've crossed the waves for her
In shadows dark, this cursed night
My thoughts and memories stir

I've left the memories
Of our youth behind
I don't know what he hopes to find
In the shadows he waits for me
For a dream that cannot be

Come with me
I'll set you free
And I'll show you
What your life could be

You can't see
That I am free
My life is mine, not yours.
So leave me be

She refuses to leave
So I grab her by force

I pull the knife I've concealed
I put the edge to his throat

Shocked by the attack
I can feel her final words sear

Leave and never come back
Or I'll cut you ear to ear

You can't see
That I am free
My life is mine, not yours.
So leave me be

I'll set you free
He said to me
And I'll show you what your life could be
I am free
She said to me
My life is mine, not yours.
So leave me be

A thick fog lies ahead
The ocean's deadly calm
Their ship glides on the silent waves
Into the unknown
He cannot turn around
For him it's much too late
He puts his back into the oar
And rows towards his fate

The ship cuts through
The milk white mist
Through the blind they clearly hear
The oar strokes of their mighty fleet
Battle's drawing near
His heart pounds loud and wild
He's waited for this day
Then suddenly a dragon's head
Appears out of the haze

Back on the Northern shores
Just as he once swore
He vowed to return
And to make them burn

Then a Northern wind picks up
It sweeps the mist away
A might viking fleet appears
Patiently they wait
"Death or victory!"
Words by which they stand
No turning back! In for the kill!
Led by thy command!

"All men grab your swords and shields
The enemies lay ahead!
We'll make this bay our battlefield
and fill the waves with dead!"
Darkness then descends
Day turns into night
A massive cloud of thousand arrows
Fills the misty sky

With violent force
The two fleets crash
The battle now begins
Cries of war as weapons clash
Uncertain who will win

Thunder rolls 'cross the waves
Lightning cracks the sky
Clouds release hail big as grapes
As arrows are let fly

Hear the berserks roar!
They call to mighty Thor!
The fury in their raging eyes
Will burn forever more
Hear the weapons sing!
Feel the arrows sting!
They climb onto the Earl's great ship
And begin to swing

The fight is fierce as they attack
With sword and axe, no guts, no glory!
Arrow pierced, they won't back down
They battle on with heart and fury
Then it turns
The flanking ships give way
And soon they are embattled
Standing firm! Fight 'til death!
They refuse to die like cattle

Fighting for his life
No holds barred
So close to revenge
Close but yet so far

Then he stands before him
It's like the battle fades
He sees his father's eyes
As he's struck into the waves

Back on Northern shores
Just as he once swore
He has met his fate
In these cold dark waves

He looks to clouds up high
A dead and distant stare
She comes out of the light
See the chariot flare
Standing on the shore
He hears her silent call
Freja leads him through the door
Into the great hall
As his life's blood leaving
I hold my son, my only son
And tears fill my burning eyes

While his skin turns pale as snow
Butchered he lies here bleeding in my arms
Slewn by the men of the single god
Hatred burns in my chest

Rain falls from a raging heaven
The wind howls like wolves at the moon
I will seek my vengeance for my son
I swear I'll avenge my first born one
I ride fast through the woods
My friends are by my side
Dark hatred burns in my eyes
"Slaves of hvitekrist today you die!"

"Mäktiga gudar,
i gyllene salen.
Hjälp mig i striden
mot sondräparna,
Den höge skall
för huggen hämnas
och blod skall gäldas
i blod"

Our cloaks fly in the wind
As we ride in the cold dark night
We're closing in our enemies
We rage in our hearts burning bright

The clouds scatter in the northern wind
A full moon rides the pitch black sky
"Now, hounds of Hvitekrist,
your time has come to die!"

"Kneel before my sword!
No mercy! Your time has come to die!
This is the ride for vengeance!"


2. The Dragon's Flight Across The Waves


Alone he stands in the doorway
His family still asleep
Gazing at the starlit horizon
And the moonsparkling sea
When dawn comes he must leave them
His home, his children and loved
For his destiny beyond those waves
Known only to the Norns

He's already dressed ready to leave
His four friends are waiting by the shore
Each with a dragon ship
And one hundred men prepared for war

He returns to his bed kissing
His sleeping wife goodbye
And as he leaves his youngest son
A tear rolls from his eye

They set sail with the first morning rays
Heading for glorious wars
And as the five ships steer out from the bay
Their hearts pound like never before

The wind is strong, the sun is warm
Their Dragons fly across the waves
No greenfaces are seen here onboard
Only a crowd of braves

Many nights pass
And days long as a year
They await the battle
They await without fear

On the morning of the fifth day
Before the sun arose
They hear bells chime and see pyres
Torched at a nearby coast

"LOWER THE SAIL, GRAB YOUR OARS,
NOW MEN IT'S TIME TO ACT!
ROW LIKE THE WIND TO THE SHORE,
ROW LIKE THE WIND TO ATTACK!"


3. Without Fear


I see
Without fear my destiny
As the raging skies begins to fade
Pouring rain
Licks my wounds as my blood flows
From my torn flesh!

As I die
I hold my sword
My only friend
And pray that Oden
Will take me home

The battle rages
But I hear only raindrops falling
Like in slow motion to the ground

Death release me
Free me from my earthly pain
Oden I ask thee please
Take me home

Without fear I die!

As I look
To the sky the heaven is lit
And Valkyries in shining armour
Descend

I rest my head
On the ground
And close my eyes
I know that Oden's sent for me
As I die

Without fear I die
I hold my sword
And die
Without fear


4. Victorious March


Ten heavy feet
Walk the bloodsoiled ground
With rhythm these
Five warriors march

No matter how much
The bleeding wounds
From enemy swordcuts
Hurt to the bone

The revenge they sought
Was taken in blood
No mercy was showed
No mercy was showed

They ignore the pain
That hammerlike pounds
From falls, off slain horses,
To the ground

No signs of weakness
No signs of weariness
Not even a glimpse
Of remorse in their eyes

They slew men ruthless
Fed the wolves with flesh
And now they leave
This land side by side

Now they're headed home
Five swordsmen who fought repentlessly
Their story will be told
Of five brave men endlessly

All sorrow is left
For the women to bare
The children cries
They live in fear

No man was spared
No house or farm remains
No christian woman unraped
Their church consumed by flames

Their steel shines red
With enemy blood
It sings of victory
Granted by the Gods
And as they return
Bleeding but proud
The horizon burns
And the song is ringing loud


5. Friends Of The Suncross


Salt water licks my face
and wind fills the sail
We head for wars on distant shores

My friends are all with me
And so they'll always be
We'll never bend untill the end

We cross the open waves
On course to far off lands
Thor guides our ships
With his strong hands

Across the waves our seasnakes fly
Carried like ravens in the sky
By heavens breath on wings of death

Blood will run red
As we sever bodies from their heads
We maim and kill by pure will

We hail our Gods
Sacrifice in blood
Our altar is the battlefields

Death is something we don't fear
Though it's always near
Ygg brings us home when time has come

We are five of us
Friends of the suncross
Strong and brave to the grave!


6. Abandoned


They came riding down the slopes
Five fearless men prepared to fight
We heard with fear the rumbling earth
In the mid-day light

Surprised we saw all terrified
The brave northmen's run
The fearless five with power ride
Attacking us in the mid-day sun

Their charge was fast, no alarm was sound
They broke right through our lines
I felt the cut it threw me to the ground
And now I feel has come my time

I lie here in my blood
And see my family get killed
I feel abandoned by my god
I fear death's chill

I see Hel's gates
Towering high
And dark are they
I don't want to die

Oh no! I was wrong
Denied the true gods
And now I'm doomed
I trusted foreign men
And their god's son
But now when I need them
They are gone

I see Hel's gates
Towering high
And dark are they
I die!

They ride across the planes
And punish those of false belief
All resistance is in vain
As they caress them with cold steel

They are the punishers
And they will never bend
They are power the five of them
From Asgard they are sent

The power they have in all they do
The Christians non will feel
No one can escape them no
They will make them kneel

Their fight is through, they must return
No one here survived
And as the blood red sky begins to burn
To Valhall they will ride


7. Amon Amarth


A storm rolls in from the sea
Covering the land with black thunder clouds
Rain whips the ground at their feet
As they come ashore in this foreign land

Thunder brakes the silence
Of fivehundred men assembled ashore
Gazing through the misty rain
At the mountain not a mile away
So dark and silent it stands there
The mighty AMON AMARTH
Reaching for the cloudcloked skies
So grim and fearful in might

With the wind in their backs they start walking
Decisive men of the north
They strive through this darkened land
With only mount doom in their sight
The closer they get to the mountain
The clearer their eyes can see
A forest of one thousand spears awaiting
Awaiting the battle that will be

A cry of war emerges
Echoes over the field
Warriors run, like wolves up the sloaps
Boldley charging the enemy lines

With weapons so fearsome and sharp in their hands
And shields of oakwood and steel
They slit open stomachs and split skulls to the jaw
Intestants cover the field

The defenders are weak in this brutal war
The northmen have power and guts
A bloodshed like no one has seen here before
None can escape their cuts

Arrows with fire fly through the air
Touching houses and shields
The Vikings can feel victory is near
As the enemy headlessly flees

A gust of wind blows in from the north
Clearing the clouds away
As twilight falls and the stars come forth
And the seawolves return to the bay

Corpses lie scattered all over the field
For the ravens to eat as they please
The mountain is now left there behind
As they sail with the first morning breeze


8. Once Sent From The Golden Hall


Rumbling thunder cracks the sky
And rain starts pouring down
Lightning strikes a cold bright light
Upon the blooddrenched ground

The sword play is hard
And many fall
Steel bites sharp in flesh
And upon a mountain
Towering tall
Stand the messengers of death

Five horsemen in armour bright
Waiting in the flashing light
Looking down upon the field
Where Vikings fight with axe and shield

On stallions black as night
With eyes burning red
They ride with thunder to the fight
Deliverance of certain death

A warcry loud as Heimdall's horne
Echoes across the land
Enemies who hear it freeze to the bone
Friends of doom proudly stand

They ride faster than the wind
With lightning speed they strike
Black ravens follow where they've been
To feed from those who died

With power they wield their swords
As they ride down fleeing men
Sending them to Hel's dark court
To never come back again

The warriors ride once more
To the mountain from which they came
Once sent by the gods to war
And they never return in shame(Balder) Nightmares
Demons haunt my taunted mind
I'm scared
My death's forseen ungloryful
Plase Father
Make my demons disappear
Please Mother
Death is everywhere

(Odin) My son I've seen your fear
I have felt your pain
No harm will come to you
An oath has been sworn

(Balder) The evil forces around us
Still wants to destroy me
Who is the evil slayer
I cannot see

Loke the deceitful God
Discover the arrow of death

Pointed for the Hoder the blind
by the jealous Loke
The arrow cut through the skin
And into the heart of the bright one

Silence spread throughout the hall Aesir
As the God of Light fe to his knees dying!

Sorrow throughout the nine worlds
The bright God is gone
Sent to Nifelheim by the deceitful...


2. The Arrival Of The Fimbul Winter


The bleak fimbul winter arrived
Raging across the world
With a fury that defied the memory of man
Terrible wars where fought,
the like had never been seen
Men slew without a thought
The ties of kinship were no more

Skoll and Hati, the ravenous wolves
Arose and devoured the sun and the moon
Darkness descended upon the earth
And the stars fell from the skies
Loud blows heimdall the horne's in the air
Odin quests the head of Mim
Now shakes the holy ash where it stands
The ancient tree moans, Fenris breaks free

How are the Aesir?
How are the Alves?
Loud sounds Joutunheim
Aesir comprise
By the stonedoors dwarfs are moaning
The mountains wise men
Know you now or not?

With his shield at hand
Hrym travels from the east
The serpant is turning, enormous in rage

The serpant breaks the waves
The eagle screams
Nidhoggs tearing corpses
Free comes Nagelfar

Loke leads the legions of the dead
In holy war
Against the justice made by Aesir


3. Burning Creation


Surtur comes from the south
With red hot fire wargods swords
shines like the sun
Mountains breaks, men on hel-road
The heaven crumbles, Ragnarok is at hand

Then to Hlin appears
Another grief when Odin goes to fight
The evil Fenris
And the brave and glory Frey
goes against Surtur
Then will Friggs beloved one die
Vidar,Odin's mighty son,
he will come to slay the wolf
The sword runs into the
heart of Hverdrungs son
So he avenges his father

So comes Llodyns noble son
Thor he goes to fight the snake
In anger he slays the guardian of Midgaard
Nine steps dying walks Odin's son
Away from the snake who misdeeds not fear
Dying from it venom

When all are gone
Only Surtur remained
Passing his hand of fire
across the whole world
Consuming all of creation


4. The Mighty Doors Of The Speargod's Hall


[Music/Lyrics: Amon Amarth]

A battle on a distant shore
Seawolves' wrath sweeps the land
Down from the sky Valkyries ride
And walk the field, hallowed by Tyr

The fight is hard, axes swung
Swords bite sharp, men are slain
The ground turns red, blood-soaked field
Dead man's last bed and Oden sees

Vikings fall, in blood they lie
The web of Horns
They've met their fate
With shield and sword
They're brought in pride
To mighty doors of the Speargod's hall

The gates open and into the hall of braves
They silently walk
The one-eyed sits in glory might
Raises his cup and says:

"Pl vida faltet
Harman svingat
Det blankat svardet
Oeh banen mott
Till den hoges sal
De i ara forts
Oeh vid mjodet hor
Oden kvada"

Dawn breaks. The Einherjer goes to
Relive their last fight
With passion, swords held high
As they ride in the morning mist

The sun warms the air
War cries sound
"Tor Hjelpe!"
The battle begins

Charging horses with fire in breath
Rush to battle - in glory die!

Swords sing in joy
Again they cut
With shining edges
Blood-stained steel

Axes shine, again they're swung
Ripping flesh - death be done

The cold night comes
With charging darkness
To Oden's hall
The Einherjer return

A feast awaits until the next day
When warriors' eyes again shall burn


5. Under The Grayclouded Winter Sky


[Music/Lyrics: Amon Amarth]

Grey clouds - cover the winter sky
Cold snow - falls like autumn leaves to the ground

The icy wind
Pierces the skin of waiting warriors
Like spears
Will pierce their bodies in battle

Frosted
Beards on pale grey faces
Eyes of death
Are burning with rage

Glancing across the fields of Tyr
In the early morning light

Grey clouds - cover the winter sky
Cold snow - falls like autumn leaves to the ground

The icy wind
Pierces the skin of waiting warriors
Like spears
Will pierce their bodies in battle

War cries break the silent wait
Charging warriors rush to kill
Swords are swung in the air
The gods of war are called

Vikings with fire in soul
Clash on the open field
Slaying with powerful strokes
The snow is turning red

Hooves gallop the plains
Warlords on horsebacks
Ride into battle
With a thunderous roar

The storm wind of death
Blows across the field
Sweeping with it
Everything in its way

So the battle settles
Alone stands just one man
Under the grey-clouded winter sky - alone. . .War, the very first war of our world,
When the treacherous witch was killed
Three times burned and three times born,
By searing flames was Gullveig torn.

Death, Odin hurled his spear off with great force
Deep into the great vana-fyrd
battle horns gave up their sound
And Asgard walls razed to the ground.

The Vanir felt deceived
Hœnir was a fool
without Mímir at his side
Hœnir could not rule
In a fit of violent rage
Mímir's blood was shed
and to Odin's court they sent Mímir's severed head

Truce, so a brittle and frail peace was forged
And to ensure that the peace remained.
Njordr and Freyr to Asgard came
and Hön' and Mim to Vanaheim

Death, see the furious gods wanting blood,
Odin knew that a raging war
would not bring them any gain
Just leave a black and bitter stain.

Odin tog huvudet och
smorde det med örter
som hindrar det
från att ruttna
han kvad sedan
trollsånger över det
så att Mimer åter
kunde tala till honom

[English translation:]
Odin took the head, and anointed it with herbs
which prevents it from rotting
he sang his magic songs over it
so that Mimer be able to speak to him

The Vanir felt deceived
Hœnir was a fool
without Mímir at his side
Hœnir could not rule
In a fit of violent rage
Mímir's blood was shed
and to Odin's court they sent Mímir's severed head


2. Töck's Taunt - Loke's Treachery Part II


You come to me, eyes full of grief
you ask of me to shed all my tears
to let him return from kingdom of fears
Why should I weep? or lose any sleep?
He never brought me pleasure or glee
so why would I help to set Balder free

You come to me,eyes full of grief
all of your tears mean nothing to me
so why will you not just leave me to be
am I to blame? Well, I'm not ashamed!
Oh how I smiled when I heard the tale
Of Loke the sly, so clever and brave

Höder the fool,Lopt's willing tool
he held the twig that cut Balder's skin
Lopt aimed the shot
that killed Höder's twin
leave me alone
don't come here and moan
I've never wished to see Balder's well
so let his soul remain down in hel

My name is Töck and I won't cry
I won't let Balder return
Let hel keep her treasured prize
let his soul forever burn

You come to me and cannot believe
that this old crow now talking to you
is Loke not Töck you bloody dawn fools
you come to me and you do not see
all of your tears mean nothing to me
why will you not just leave me to be

[solo: Mikkonen]

My name is Töck,and I won't cry
I won't let Balder return
Let hel keep her treasured prize
let his soul forever burn


3. Destroyer Of The Universe


I rise up from muspelheim
My fury is sublime
The sword I bring burns violently
With wild and lethal flames

I march against the asagods
To bring the end of time
I am pure and endless pain
And Surtur is my name

See me rise, the mighty Surt
Destroyer of the universe
Bringer of flames and endless hurt
Scorcher of men and earth

[Solo: Södenberg]

Swordless frej with horn in hand
Rises to his final stand
He doesn't stand a single chance
I'll split his living corpse in half

And yet he stabbed me in the eye
He drove the horn in deep
The overwhelming, raging pain
Is driving me insane

The waves of flames that
I've unleashed will eat us all alive
The rage that burns within my heart
Is uncontrolled and wild
And now everything shall die!
Massive waves consume us all, the ocean is released
Our dying world quakes underneath
And sinks into the sea
And now nothing will survive!
Extinction waits for everyone
For gods and men alike
When all are gone of the old world
A new one will arise

[Solo: Södenberg]

See me rise, the mighty Surt
Destroyer of the universe
Bringer of flames and endless hurt
Scorcher of men and earth

See me die, the mighty Surt
Destroyer of the universe
Drowning in waves that floods the earth
The beginning, of a new rebirth


4. Slaves Of Fear


They speak of love and tolerance
They thrive on people's ignorance
To make you all slaves of fear

They feed on your anxiety
To build their dead society
They've kept you down for a thousand years

They nurture prejudice and hate
Condemn the wars that they create
In the name of whatever god

They gladly sacrifice your lives
Increasing power is their prize
Without regrets they'll spill your blood

They're feeding you lies
With calculating smiles
Enslavement of the human mind
As long as you kneel to their authority
Religion is what makes you blind

They're treating you as mindless fools
And use you as obedient tools
It's time to set your spirit free

This world we cannot tolerate
It's time to seal all preachers' fate
And let them hang from Oden's tree

Your minds are restrained
Obedience is the chain
They've locked you up and thrown away the key
Your souls are for sale,
And you're the ones who pay
But still you'll never be set free

They're feeding you lies
With calculating smiles
Enslavement of the human mind
As long as you kneel to their authority
Religion is what makes you blind


5. Live Without Regrets


From birth we're taught how to survive
We're taught how war is waged
And there are no men now alive
Who stops our wild rampage

Light at heart we bide our bane
whatever death awaits!
Norsemen live without regrets
We accept our woven fates

So fearlessly we charge ahead
There is no time to hesitate

Don't despair, show no fear
Live your life without regrets
Don't despair and show no fear
In the face of a certain death

A coward thinks he'll always live
If it keeps himself from strife
Old age leaves no rest and peace
though spears may spare his life

We don't mourn a friend that fell
or dread the day we'll fall ourselves
Warriors don't go to Hel
'cause we know Ygg will greet us well!

Fearlessly we charge ahead
There is no time to hesitate

Don't despair, show no fear
Live your life without regrets
Don't despair and show no fear
In the face of a certain death

So raise your horns to those who died
Let's drink to fallen friends tonight
Let's celebrate their glory life
We'll meet again in Valhall when we die
When we die!
When we die!


6. The Last Stand Of Frej


See him rise, from land of flames
our destruction is at hand.
It is time to make stand
now I face, and awesome foe
I will always stand my ground
To this end my fate is bound!

This fight is mine and mine alone
and there's no help from anyone!

His wrath burns!
With insane heat
all his fury is unleashed
there is no way to defeat!
The forces and the power that he wields

My hand holds the horn so firm
I am calm and ready to die
Everything around me burns
And I know that I will not survive

See him rise from land of flames
in this wild and barren land
I will make my final stand
My death awaits, I have no fear
To this end my fate is bound
though I'm doomed
I'll stand my ground!

This fight is mine and mine alone
and there's no help from anyone!

[Solo: Simon Solomon]

I go forth to meet my doom
but I will die in vain
perdition waits for everyone
The world will die in flames

With all my strength I run the horn
deep into his eye
And as he swings his burning sword
I die with a tired smile!

[Solo: Simon Solomon]


7. For Victory Or Death


Time!
has come to wash our shame away
to erase the image of defeat
We!
have licked our wounds,restored our strength
and our vengeance will be oh so sweet

They thought they had us down
that we'd never rise again
they will learn that they were deadly wrong
what's owed will be repaid

Again we'll feed the wolves
and then vengeance will be ours
we'll split their skulls and spill their guts
upon the frozen ground
Yeah,we'll never kneel again
not to deity nor men
now they'll taste our bitter hate
what's owed will be repaid

So raise the flag once more
and the eagle will be fed
once again we march to war
for victory or death

They arrived with talk of hvitekrist
by force they wanted us to kneel
with their swords held to our throats they preached
but we will make them pay we'll take their lives away

[solo: Mikkonen]

So Raise!
raise the flag once more
in the east the eagle will be fed
March!
again we march to war
we will march for victory or death
Pain!
the pain and suffering
is but a bleak and distant fading dream
Shame!
our disgrace; a withering thought
finally our names will be redeemed


8. Wrath Of The Norsemen


My head hurts like hell
Can't open my eyes
My clothes are all wet
And I'm freezing right through
Don't know where I am
Or how to get home
My arms they're so numb
And it's hard to get up

My muscles they ache
With every move
I stand on my feet
But my knees feel so weak

[Chorus:]
Somebody wake me
From this horrible dream
Somebody save me
From this terror I feel

[Solo: Söderberg]

I stumble around
on the soft muddy ground
I call out the name
of the friends I can't find
but only the wind
And the ravens reply

With every gasp
with every breath
smoke fills my lungs
and my intestines wrench
With every gasp
the sweet taste of death
The air is full of a thick
pungent stench

[Solo: Söderberg]

So comes then rain
it's colder than ice
I wash off my face
and open my eyes
And then I see
but wish I were blind

They are all dead
there's blood everywhere
The Norsemen they left
only death and despair
A stench of flesh
that fills the Autumn air

[Chorus:]
Somebody wake me
From this horrible dream
Somebody save me
From this terror and pain
No one can save me
From this horrible dream
No one can hear me
Or my heart-wrenching screams


9. A Beast Am I


Conceived was I
From chaos and hate
Of malice, deceit and blood
And how would they know
My fate is to rise
Against the Asagods
My being is full, full of a rage
An evil that can't be tamed
It darkens my soul
And blackens the blood
A fire that fills my veins

So how
Did I ever end up here?
Humiliated, broken and weak
I've waited
For a thousand years
To break these chains apart and
To finally break myself free

I bit the hand, off the mighty Tyr
When I couldn't, tare my ties
Now banished I dwell
A sword in my jaw
awaiting the end of time
In darkness I drown
Consumed by my hate
Longing for revenge
Allfather will pay
For his deceit
At the battle
Of Ragnarök

A beast am I
So vicious and grim
They fear my mean
Grinning teeth
I bide my time
my sweet revenge
Soon my ties will fall
And finally I will be free

So when you hear me howling
You'll know that I have come for you
When you hear me call your name
Your life will end in nameless pain

[Solo: Simon Solomon]

Conceived was I
From chaos and hate
Of malice, deceit and blood
And how would they know
My fate is to rise
Against the Asagods
My being is full, full of a rage
An evil that can't be tamed
It darkens my soul
And blackens the blood
A fire that fills my veins

A beast am I
So vicious and grim
They fear my mean
Grinning teeth
I bide my time
my sweet revenge
Soon my ties will fall
And finally I will be!
Finally break myself!
Finally I will be free!


10. Doom Over Dead Man


The autumn clouds are caving in
And night comes crawling, black as sin
Lightning strikes, and rain begins
A storm that tears my soul

I toss and tumble in my bed
My thoughts are spinning in my head
Darkness nears, soon I'll be dead
I'm losing all control

I've spent my life in foolish quests
for gold and riches, I confess
And now I'm left with just regrets
Too late to change my ways

My life, it seems, has slipped away
I leave no legacy to praise
Nothing more for me to say
My life has been a waste

When!
My time has come for me to leave
When!
When judgment's passed upon my life
When!
A cold dark grave will wait for me
Will!
Will my name live endlessly?
When!
My time has come for me to leave
When!
When judgment's passed upon my life
When!
A cold dark grave will wait for me
Will!
Will my name live endlessly?

So I die
But won't be mourned
Broken and alone
I wish that I were never born

So I die and won't be missed
No rune stone will be raised
As my body rots away

Die!
All friends and cattle pass away
Die!
And death will come for every man
Die!
But I know one thing never dies
Doom!
The sentence passed upon the dead
Now!
The time has come for me to leave
Now!
When judgement's passed up on my life
Now!
Now I will rest in my dark grave
Will!
They speak my name with reverence?

My life has been a waste
No rune stone will be raised
So I die, but won't be mourned
I wish that I were never born
I rest here in my shallow grave
As my body rots away
Making way through blades and spears
We attack at dawn
The glory scene is near
From northern gods we're spawned

Defender's fighting spirit crack
Torching house of single god
We leave land burnt black
And bodies floating in blood

War to us is holy
We sacrifice our blood
War to us is holy
We bleed for ancient Gods

Blasting forth with rage in our war eyes
We burn with hate
Cut our way through hordes of weak Christian flesh
Cast them into death
WAR!

War to us is holy
We sacrifice our blood
War to us is holy
We bleed for ancient Gods

Burn away the false and untrue ones
We make them kneel
To the only true and powerful Gods
And then we kill
WAR!


2. The Last With Pagan Blood


We storm ahead with swords and shields
For victory we ride
We fight the world on these battlefields
To re-erect the pagan pride

We draw the blood of those in our way
It's 'victory or die
With pounding, raging fury we slay
The Christian hounds will pay

Charge ahead, no retreat
No mercy, none shall live
To us there is no defeat
No remorse to give

A wind of power blows from the north
The enemy shivers to the core
We slay with strength, pushing forth
Silence before the storm

The gates of Valhalla open up
The ground beneath us shakes
As Odin leads the Gods to war
The Rainbow Bridge cracks

Nothing can stop this final attack
We carve up all in our path
Now there is no turning back
Final battle is here at last

A feast awaits us when we return
Awaiting all that fought in wrath
By the long fires we sit in glory
And beer will cool our soar throats

We are few but strong in will
The last with pagan blood
We fought the world with burning steel
Now we sit in Hall of Gods

Pride and glory in our hearts
Pride and glory in our hearts


3. North Sea Storm


Above my heads mighty men battle
Flashing blades rip through the air
Cracking shields with rumbling thunder
Rolling over the waves

Blood pours like rain onto the sea
As it wind-whipped foams
Warlords in shining helmets
Send men screaming to their death

Clouds of black cover the sea
Day turns into night
Infinite darkness beckons me
No more sun, no more light

Ships tied stern to stern
A battle on the north sea waves
Hearts of braves brightly burn
Berserks swing their metal-blades

Battle hammers hit with force
Crushing helmet covers heads
Dying men tumble over board
Foaming waves colored red

Memories invade my mind
As my harness brings me down

My body's getting cold and numb
As the ocean pulls me down

Above my head my brave friends battle
Their flashing blades rip through the air
Sending men screaming to join me
As I die in these cold north sea waves


4. Avenger


My pale face face glows in the light of fire
My hollow eyes see but cannot see
I stare deep into the glowing inferno
The loss I feel is breaking me

I heard their screams
Through flaming walls
Walls, I could not tear down
I could not help them

I'd been away for two full years
Only to return too late to save them
Helplessly I watched my life go up in flames

I pull the sword from the glowing fire
And hammer-beat in on the anvil
Forging it with rage and hate
I will seal my enemy's fate

I engrave the blade with magic runes
And summon Gods by sacrifice in blood
Pure blue hate shines within this sword
This magic sword will cut only once

No sword has ever been like this one
The Avenger is its name

Now my sworn enemy
Vengeance will belong to me
A year has gone by
Now my sworn enemy
It's your turn to die
It's your turn to die!
Die!
To die!
Die, die!
Die, die!
Die, die, die, die, die!

The sword cuts through his throat
His head tumbles to the ground
The headless body lays gently down
Down to sleep in a pool of blood

The Avenger has lost its shine
The magic is now drained
Dull and useless it rests in my hand
Its purpose is soon fulfilled

Now hate is gone but emptiness remains
So I turn the blade around
And run it through my stomach veins
And I fall to the ground


5. God, His Son And Holy Whore


Serpent tongue speaks to me
Of a man from southern land
How ancient Gods are enemies
But I don't understand

Hippocritic voice of love talks of peace and Christ
Blasphemer of Gods above
One thousand years of lies

They hold their swords to out throats
And force-feed us with faith
'Bout god, his son and holy whore
But now we retaliate

Prophets of a false believe talk with tongue of ice
Threaten us with hell beneath
Now they all shall die

Turn the blade around, put the oppressors down

Free yourselves from the chains
Of lies that hold you down
Arise to be free again
We'll fight till we have won

Priests of hippocratic love talk of peace and Christ
Power is their only goal
Now they all shall die

Turn the blade around, put the oppressors down

Mess with us and you will feel
A pain so true yet so unreal

Yeah, use your hate, uncreate
Christian state will meet its fate

God, his son and holy whore
Now you will meet your fate


6. Metalwrath


Wrath, hate, pain and death
The code we live by
It's in our souls
Metal is the way

We fight the world
With glowing metal
Now the falses will pay

Our fight has just begun
We're sent from hall of gold
Messengers of death

We're coming after you
You can't escape us
We'll take away your breath

See us ride for vengeance
Friends of the sun cross
We are born of steel

See us ride down
The Amon Amarth
The last sight you'll ever see

So as you stand there
Under gray-clouded skies
Abandoned by your god
You know you're gonna die

You feel a sorrow
Surrounding you
As of the nine worlds
Screaming pain you feel
Your soul vaporizes
As your hearts burst

We charge without fear
Your time has come
Your Fimbul winter's arrived

A chilling wind of ice
Whirls through your heart
Pierces your bones and spine

We are all
Gazing to the skies
We'll make the false hammer fall
And we'll make Thor arise

Our quest is done
Your creation burns
Now we return to Odin's hall

Our dragon's fly
Across the waves
As twilight begins to fall

In victory we ride
We enter the mighty doors
Of the spear-god's hall

As Ygg salutes us
We raise our beers
And drink in honor of our cause

We are all
Greeted by the Gods
We made the false hammer fall
And Thor arose in blood


7. Legend Of A Banished Man


Run for your lives, death has arrived
Try save your soul, run from the sound of rowing oars

Out of the mist
Breaks a dragon ship
Even more feared
Than the nail-ship "Naglfar"

A bear-coated man stands in the bow
Cold-eyed he gazes towards the shoer
The dragon's head is grim and red
All covered with blood, a gift to the mighty Gods

Warshields are raised, the Gods are praised
The people stare paralyzed with fear

The legend tells of a man that fell
From grace of his baptised king
As a banished man he fled his land
But solemnly sworn to return with holy war

But no one knows how the legend goes
'Cause no ones survived
That's gazed into his eyes
'Cause no one's returned that's met his fire

They say wolf-skinned men follow him
Berserks whose eyes burn with flames of ice

Some say mighty Thor
Guides their blades in war
They say they cannot be killed
Nor can their blood be spilled

So run for your lives
Death has arrived
The legend has come
To take the lives of the deceitful ones

Run for your lives
The death ship's arrived
There's no way you'll live
To tell of meeting his fire
Bastards of a lying breed
You've ruled us for too long
Truth to you are lies to me
And your right is so wrong

Moral preached by immoral fucks
All I feel is despise
Lie no more you fucking cunts
You tare me up inside

Your sons die from your abuse
But you're giving us the blame
The easy path's the one you choose
That road will lead to pain
You're trying to control their mind
And strip them of free will
They way you force them to go blind
Will surely get them killed

My mind is free and so is my soul
You can't put me in chains
I won't play the well-adjusted role
Or bow my head in shame

So throw your stones of guilt at me
Point your finger, Curse my name!
Your scapegoat I will never be
I won't take the blame!

Now we're on trial to serve your crime
And pay for your mistakes
There is no way we'll do the time
The chains of lies will break
Censorship can't stop our truth
We speak straight from the heart
There is nothing you can do
We'll tare your souls apart

So see us rise we're few but strong
We'll crack your fucking teeth
And feed you with your twisted tongue
Until you cannot breathe

The fury makes our eyes see red
It burns within our hearts
Soon you'll all be stone cold dead
We'll tare your souls apart!


2. Masters Of War


STRIKE!
Fast and hard, show no mercy for these men
The vermin of Christ, prophets of lies and their disciples
Seek them out, hunt them down
Break their spirits, crush their hearts
Not even death will set them free from this pain

CHARGE!
Ride them down as they flee from our steel
Draw their blood, make them suffer
Before they die by war-field sacrifice
Wipe them out! Burn their homes and fields
Feed the wolves with their offspring, annihilate them all!

Masters of War, torment every soul
Rape every whore that carries the cross

FIRE!
Burn them all, burn them alive
Send their souls to Deathqueen's hall
To the land of cold burning flames
Send them to the land of famine and despair
Eternally they will starve and freeze


3. The Sound Of Eight Hooves


He's running through the woods so black
A loyal servant of Christ
Dogs are barking down his back
He's running for his life

He came with words of love and peace
These heathens had to be saved
He thought that he could make them see
Instead he was enslaved

In captivity he spoke of god
To all he met he preached
But when his master's patience ran out
He knew he had to flee

Tears are running down his cheeks
As he sobbign realizes
That in this land his god is weak
And today he's going to die

He stumbles out onto an open field
Where an old oak tree grows
In the branches hang men of three
Dressed in preacher robes

His knees refuse to carry him on
Terror shines in his eyes
His faith in Christ is almost gone
His god's left him to die
Below the dead he says his prayers
To the god he thought was alive
When he hears a calm voice say:
"SHUT HIM UP AND HANG HIM HIGH!"

As his breath leaves his eyes open wide
A bright light comes from above
He greets this light with a smile
And thinks: "There is a God"

The sound of eight hooves reaches his ears
Comes from the heavenly light
Two wolves' howls fill his heart with fear
And he sees two ravens fly
Down from the sky a warlord rides
Like fire his one eye glows
And just before the preacher dies
He knows his god is false


4. Risen From The Sea 2000


Risen from the sea
The beast of hell is here
He's come to rule the earth
Kneel and obey his power

A second beast rises
Rises from the earth
Followed by an army
An army of immortals
An army of the dead

Second beast breaks from the earth
Kneel and obey his power
Fire in the rocks
Fire from the sky
Kneel and obey

Kneel or die!!
Kneel or die!!

There is wisdom with him
Who hath understanding reckon
The number of the beast for it is
A number of a man its number
Is six hundred sixty six, 666

He's risen from the sea
The beasts of hell are here
Come to rule the world
And you will be in fire

So it is written, So it has been
The beast is here, to rule the world
So it is written, So it has been
The beast is here, to rule the world

So it is written, So it has been
The beast is here, to rule the world
So it is written, So it has been
The beast is here, to rule the world


5. As Long As The Raven Flies


Men will fight and men will die
Wars will be lost and won
That's how it's been and still will be
Long after I'm gone

Doubting not I give my blood
So I may enter hall up high
The sky belongs to Asagods
As long as the raven flies


6. A Fury Divine


Death is drawing near
I know it's true but I have no fear
I know I can't escape my:

FATE! Turns it's deadly wheel
Judgement day is closing in but still I cannot feel:

REMORSE! Is for the weak
I stand silent while they speak, their accusations are all:

LIES! Spread by preaching men
I'm on trial for being who I am
And praising the Gods of my native land

I will stand firm, I refuse to kneel
The fury in me is divine
My dark grave awaits, my fate is revealed
But I'm not afraid to die

Death! The day to die is here
The sun rides high on the northern sphere
And the executioner sharpens his:

Axe! Shines in the sun
I smile when they tie me down
And hear the sound of the falling blade
Death! Sweet death, relieve me from this world
Death! Sweet death, relieve me, relieve:

So death finally came to him
The pagan man could not be turned
He faced death with a grin
Now his head rests in the dust

The proud man stood firm, he refused to kneel
Then fury in him was divine
Now he is dead, his fate has been sealed
He's brought to Golden Hall up high


7. Annihilation Of Hammerfest


All is lost and foreign kings
Rule the northern realms
Hammerfest, the last outpost
Has fallen to unbearded men

Lords of the bloody cross
Deceived or murdered all of true faith
Now the temple of Thor, where Mjolner is kept
Is under siege

They fear the power of Mjolner
The hammer of Thor
And all their efforts to destroy it have failed

From deep within the frozen ground
Comes a rumbling sound
Ravens fly and wild wolves howl
Sending shivers down Christians' spines

As if from nowhere
Dark and grim he appears
The warlord of the Gods comes with force
To retrieve The Crusher

The first man died with a gurgling sigh
When his head was crushed
Painful surprise in his eyes
As his life was snuffed

With raw and brutal force
The warlord breaks the temple doors
The weak back off in fear
On the altar it lies, he lifts the hammer high
And before it he swears:

`Allvise Ygg, Maktige Harjafader
Guda av Asars och vaners att
Hor mina ord, nar som jag svar
Att om tusen vintrar ater ta var ratt?

While he speaks his prayer
Mjolner rests in the air
As if holding breath

Frozen by fear
They gathered stand and stare
And what they see is death

A laughing cry fill the shivering night
He lets the hammer strike
A bolt of lightning bright
Rips the darkened sky
Fire of doom - Ignite!


8. The Fall Through Ginnungagap


Once I was - Now I am no more
A burst of flames threw me into oblivion

The life I knew - Seems distant and unreal
A fading dream, a memory I can't recall

Am I real - I can no longer tell
A notion tells me I still exist

Infinite dark - Through this void I float
Resting, waiting for the day
When I will live again

Eons pass or maybe I just blinked
Deeper into this hell I sink

Falling through Ginnungagap
I'm pulled towards an unseen gate
I seem to hear my name being called
I float towards these cries of fate

Faster than - the speed of light
I am falling through universe

Stars flash by - Before my eyes
The time has come to return

Out of the dark - Into the light
Back into life I am cast

By my side - A demon army rides
We ride to reclaim that once we lost

Eons have passed, I'm back from the dead
Victory lies ahead


9. Releasing Surtur's Fire


He's riding down 'cross a field familiar but nothing is the same
This place he knew as Hammerfest
When the old Gods reigned
The army of demons rides
By his side with weapons drawn
Today is the day
When Ragnarok will be spawned

There lies the mountain where the temple once stood
Where eons ago he arose to spill their christian blood

Stuck in the rock is a golden ring
That yet no one's dared to touch
The legend has it it's where the Crusher once struck

He pulls the hammer from the mountain's grip
The sign for demons to attack
He's been called upon to arise and he won't spare a single life
No, Thor (won't) spare a single soul, nor let them get away alive
They strike down on the world with overwhelming force
All resistance is brutally crushed, crushed without remorse
Dark angels descend to join the bloodfight
The slaughter brings them on, see Odin's Valkyries ride

The battle of Midgard is almost won
And the thousand years of tyranny will be forever gone
Soon a new world will be born rising from the Sea
Where Asagods again shall reign and humans will be free

He rides once more upon the black mountain of doom
Holding firm the Crusher of giants' bones
He lets the hammer strike, now everything will burn
As Surtur's fire is released upon the world


10. Eyes Of Horror


[Bonus Track]
[originally by Possessed]

Every night I see through eyes
Of a different lunatic
And every night I fantasize
In trancial mesmeric

All alone inside my head
Within my padded cell
Ruled by thoughts of another mind
Controlled by unseen eyes

In my mind I see the sun
Plunge into the sea I listen to my
Tales now I'll tell you what I see
And so the corpses
And the thrill
My mind is warped
Nothing's real

Do I dream
Or is it true
The piercing scream
She never knew

Every night I see through eyes
Of a different lunatic
And every night I fantasize
The eyes of horror1. Twilight Of The Thunder God


[featuring Roope Latvalan]

There comes Fenris' twin
His jaws are open wide
The serpent rises from the waves

Jormungandr twists and turns
Mighty in his wrath
The eyes are full of primal hate

Thor! Odin's son
Protector of mankind
Ride to meet your fate
Your destiny awaits
Thor! Hlödyn's son
Protector of mankind
Ride to meet your fate
Ragnarök awaits

Vingtor rise to face
The snake with hammer high
At the edge of the world

Bolts of lightning fills the air
as Mjölnir does it's work
the dreadfull serpent roars in pain

Thor! Odin's son
Protector of mankind
Ride to meet your fate
Your destiny awaits
Thor! Hlödyn's son
Protector of mankind
Ride to meet your fate
Ragnarök awaits

Mighty Thor grips the snake
Firmly by its tongue
Lifts his hammer high to strike
Soon his work is done
Vingtor sends the giant snake
Bleeding to the depth
Twilight of the thundergod
Ragnarök awaits
Twilight of the thunder god
Twilight of the thunder god
Twilight of the thunder god
Twilight of the thunder god

Thor! Odin's son
Protector of mankind
Ride to meet your fate
Your destiny awaits
Thor! Hlödyn's son
Protector of mankind
Ride to meet your fate
Ragnarök awaits


2. Free Will Sacrifice


See them gathered on the plains now
See an army strong and vast
As long as one of us remains here
None of them will ever pass

Here they come so raise the shields high
Like wolves they show their teeth
None of us will ever yield now
To the scavengers beneath

We're outnumbered ten to one here
Still, I love the odds
We will sacrifice them one by one
Send them off to the gods

Soon we will be gone
A free will sacrifice
As free men we are born
And free we shall die

Here they come ten thousand strong
Charging up the hill
This day will be both hard and long
They move in for the kill

Hold the line don't let it break
Use your sword and spear
A glory death, for all awaits
All who knows no fear

Hordes of men they hit the shields
Like waves they break away
We face our woven destiny
And we don't fear the grave

Soon we will be gone
A free will sacrifice
As free men we are born
And free we shall die


3. Guardians Of Asgaard


Standing firm against all odds

4. Where Is Your God?


The enemy has come for you
Hear the pounding thunder hooves
There's no time to run or hide
Draw the weapon from your side

When they ride out
From morning mist
With sharp blades in mighty fists
One hundred warriors on horse
An awesome brutal force

You feel weak and scared
Fear has gripped your heart
You will soon be over run
You will soon be torn apart

Now, where is your god?
Does he hear your prayers?
Does he even care for you?
His silence speaks loud and clean

Raid is done!
See the country burn
All are gone!
Only misery remains
Raid is done!
The warriors return
All are gone!
All that's left is pain

The Vikings strike
So fast and hard
Those who run won't make it far
And those who chose to stand and fight
They have made the choice to die

The weapons tear through flesh and bone
Dying men that scream and moan
With severed limbs
To the hall of death

The battlefield is full of death
Feel the stench of rotting flesh
When the entire country burns
As the warriors return

And they came out
From morning mist
With sharp blades in mighty fists
They leave this land
All burned and scorn
Those alive will mourn

Now, where is your god?
Does he hear your prayers?
Does he even care for you?
His silence speaks loud and clean

Raid is done!
See the country burn
All are gone!
Only misery remains
Raid is done!
The warriors return
All are gone!
All that's left is pain
Raid is done
See the country burn,
Only misery remains
All are gone
Warriors return,
All that's left is pain
Where's your god?
Does he hear your prayers?
Does he even care?
Where's your god?
Does he hear your prayers?
A silence loud and clear!


5. Varyags Of Miklagaard


Miklagaard has been our home
For twenty years or more
We've lent our axes, spears and swords
In service of the emperor

We are loyal warriors
That's the oath we gave
To protect the emperor
Even to a violent grave

Our loyalty was always firm
We kept our given word
On these southern battlefields
Our northern war cries roared

Battles have been fought
Many gave their lives
But all who died by axe and sword
Were called to hall up high

Our time here
Is now at end
Can't help but reminisce
A cold spring day
So long ago
When we set out to sea

We!
Set out from Svitjod's
Shores!
With dreams of fame and
Gold!
And!
The work of weaving
Norn's!
Was for us unknown

We were loyal warriors
That's the oath we gave
To protect the emperor
Even to the grave

It's time to take farewell
We have been resolved
From the sacred oath we gave
It's time to go back home

Out time here
Is now at end
Our memories will stay
Of Miklagaard
Our southern home
Until the end of days

We!
Set out for Svitjod's
Shores!
With honor and
Rewards!
We return back
Home!
We return back
Home!
With honor and
Rewards!
We return back
Home!


6. Tattered Banners And Bloody Flags


There comes Lopt, the treacherous
Lusting for revenge
He leads the legions of the dead
Towards the Aesir's realm

They march in full battle dress
With faces grim and pale
Tattered banners and bloody flags
Rusty spears and blades

Cries ring out, loud and harsh
From cracked and broken horns
Long forgotten battle cries
In strange and foreign tongues

Spear and sword clash rhythmically
Against the broken shields they beat
They bring their hate and anarchy
Onto Vigrid's battlefield

There comes Lopt, the treacherous
He stands against the gods
His army grim and ravenous
Lusting for their blood

Nowhere is longer safe
The earth moves under our feet
The great world tree Yggdrasil
Trembles to its roots

Sons of Muspel gird the field
Behind them Midgaard burns
Hrym's horde march from Nifelheim
And the Fenris wolf returns

Heimdal grips the Giallarhorn
He sounds that dreaded note
Oden rides to quest the Norns
But their web is torn
The Aesir rides out to war
With armor shining bright
Followed by the Einherjer
See Valkyries ride

Nowhere is longer safe
The earth moves under our feet
The great world tree Yggdrasil
Trembles to its roots

Sons of Muspel gird the field
Behind them Midgaard burns
Hrym's horde march from Nifelheim
And the Fenris wolf returns


7. No Fear For The Setting Sun


I'm out of breath
And all my muscles ache
It feels like spikes
With every step I take

My heart beats
It's about to burst
This day my luck
Turned to the worse

There's nowhere to run
Darkness is closing in
I don't fear the setting sun
Or the twilight that it brings
Dark clouds fill the sky
My fate is close at hand
Today is the day that I die
Today I make my final stand

I fought so hard
For taste of victory
The war is lost
But I refuse to kneel

I can't go back now
There is no retreat
I will fight hard for
All that I believe

I'm out of breath
And all my muscles ache
It feels like spikes
With every step I take

I can't go back now
There is no retreat
I will fight 'til death
I make my final charge

I, make my final charge
I; have no fear in heart
I will no longer run
I, do not fear the dark

There's nowhere to run
Darkness is closing in
I don't fear the setting sun
Or the twilight that it brings
Dark clouds fill the sky
My fate is close at hand
Today is the day that I die
Today I make my final stand


8. The Hero


The blade I swing
Is black as night
Black as my soulless heart
It bears the burden
Of many lives
But I don't feel remorse

I lent my sword
To anyone
Willing to pay the price
No regrets for
What I've done
A mercenary's life

But there i was
On battleground
Until I felt the jaws of death
Cut into my flesh
Defending old and weak
But I did not retreat

Now, here I lie
In my own blood
And strangers cry for me
I'm prepared to meet the gods
I wish they'd let me be

I don't deserve
Their sympathy
I know who I am
My soul is death and misery
I am an evil man

I rest in my blood
Soon I will face the gods
Strangers cry for me
I wish they'd let me be

Show no sympathy
Shed no tears for me
I know who I am
I am an evil man

I know who I am
I am an evil man


9. Live For The Kill


[featuring Apocalyptica]

The pack of wolves
Are closing in
Now, hear the howling beasts
They move fast
Through winter woods
And soon it's time to feast

A vicious hunt
On through the night
The prey is short of breath
They feel the sting
Of burning eyes
That's fixed upon their necks

A predator's heart
Knows no remorse
It lives for the hunt
A predator's heart
Knows no remorse
It lives for the hunt
A natural force

They show their sharp
And grinning teeth
As howls are getting higher
Sending chills
Down fleeing spines
Their blood runs hot as fire

The vicious chase
Is soon at end
They're hunted until death
They feel the pain
Of sharpening steel
That's cutting through their flesh

Fearless warriors
Feed the wolves
Now hear the howling beasts
They move fast
Through winter woods
See the grey-backs feast

A natural force
It knows no remorse
And lives for the kill


10. Embrace Of The Endless Ocean


I stroke the blade with my hand
the sharp edge cuts the skin
blood drips to the rain wet sand
my journey can begin

Once a slave but now I'm free
my honor is restored
once again I'll ride the seas
free at last from whip and oar

I slide the sword into the sheath
the ocean god is hailed
and as we push out to the sea
we raise the red striped sails

I've missed the breeze of my home shores
the frozen lakes and winter snow
but now my dreams start to unfold
father, I'm coming home

The storm came down without remorse
and water crashed the rails
the ship was thrown back and forth
as strong winds ripped the sails

The icy waves embrace my skin
I am going numb
The endless ocean swallows me
This will be my cold wet tomb

Won't feel the breeze of my home shore
nor see the lakes or winter snow
my hopeful dreams lie ripped and torn
father, I die aloneRising up to reek havoc on this land
A beast straight from hell with burning steel in hand
White heat, blinding lights as the molten lava flows
Total devastation as the power hammer blows

Burning anvil of steel
Cast by demons that dwell
Burning anvil of steel
Forged in the furnace of hell

Hammered down, a crushing force of weight
Razor sharp feel the metal penetrate
Grinding pain, the sparks that rip and blind
As Armageddon is brought upon mankind

Burning anvil of steel
Cast by demons that dwell
Burning anvil of steel
Forged in the furnace of hell

Burning!
Burning!
Burning anvil of steel!
Burning!
Burning!
Burning anvil of steel!

Burning anvil of steel
Cast by the demons that dwell
Burning anvil of steel
Forged in the furnace of hell


2. Satan Rising


In the deep and darkest forest
Night has reached its final hour
Pagans dance 'round brimstone fires
Lucifer comes to call

Evil rites are getting higher
Spinning fast hands to the sky
Unholy chants around the pyre
Heathens call, "Satan" they cry

Sacrificial rites
From the trees a blood-rain's falling
The end of all mankind
Satan stirs; he's heard their calling

From the underworld
Comes the beast arising
Demons gather to behold
From the shadows Satan's rising


3. Snake Eyes


Life is just a lottery
No matter how you choose
But that has never bothered me
'cause I was born to lose

It doesn't matter what the cost
You know I won't give in
And I don't care about the odds
Because I play to win

[Chorus:]
You know I am a gambling man
And I have paid the price
Luck has never graced my hand
When I roll the dice
Snake eyes!

I trust the way I live my life
The choices that I make
To the rolling of the dice
No matter what's at stake

Some will call me fatalist
And some will call me freak
But hidden in my throwing fist
The fortune that I seek

You know I am a gambling man
And I have paid the price
Luck has never graced my hand
When I roll the dice
Snake eyes!

I caught your eye in a New York bar
You were looking down at me
An angel in black measuring in
At just over seven feet

Some fellas like their women short
Some fellas like 'em round
But me I like the kind of girl
That makes me stand up to go down!

Stand up! To go down!
No man will throw her around
Stand up! To go down!
When we make out I can't reach the ground

We took a cab, you got in the back
But the front seat had to come out
The car shook, the car bounced
As you ground me pound for pound
But back at your place you took the reins
And saddled up, you rode me around
And just as I reached the finish line
You made me stand up to go down!

Stand up! To go down!
No man will throw her around
Stand up! To go down!
When we make out I can't reach the ground

Stand up! To go down!
I'm going down but I'm upward bound
Stand up! To go down!
In a crowd she's easily found
Stand up! To go down!
No man is gonna throw her around
Stand up! To go down!
When we make out I can't reach the ground
The wait is soon at end
Always charge, never bend
Morning is here, make your stand
Live for honor, glory, death in fire!

Total war is here
Face it without fear
Age of sword, age of spear
Fight for honor, glory, death in fire!

See the fire rise
Flames are raging high
Soon all will burn and die
Burn for honor, glory, death in fire!

Storm of lethal flames
Only death remains
Ragnarok is closing in
Die for honor, glory, death in fire!

Forces of chaos is on the move
Everyone, choose your side
And know the end is coming soon
The day for all to die

The day is here when Bifrost breaks
Nor sun or moon will rise
When the dead rise from their graves
And Surtur spreads his fire

All you know will wither away
And sink into the sea
A new world will be born one day
Where everyone is free

[Lead Söderberg]

Total war is here,
Face it without fear
Age of sword, age of spear
Fight for honor, glory, death in fire!

Storm of lethal flames
Only death remains
Ragnarok is our fate
Die for honor, die for glory
Die, death in fire!


2. For The Stabwounds In Our Backs


Silently we bide our time
Soon we'll pay you back
For all the wrongs you've done our kind
For the stabwounds in our backs

You think you're safe. Well, live your lie
There's no way you'll escape
The day that all things living die
The day we rise again

Then Fenris' father will summon us
And we will rise from the death
One million warriors with foaming mouths
To challenge life itself

A horrid ship of dead men's nails
Will bring our ranks ashore
The eastern wind will fill our sails
And your son will hold the oar

You think you're safe. Well, live your lie
There's no way you'll escape
The day that all things living die
The day we rise again

Our rusty swords will never rest
So send the best you've got
Into our grinning jaws of death
We'll make their suffering short

So sit there on your golden throne
Soon we will arise
Time for vengeance is coming soon
The time for all to die!


3. Where Silent Gods Stand Guard


The last head falls to the ground
No one is left alive
They thought that they could take me down
But it's not my time to die

I wipe the blood from my sword
And slide it in my belt
This is the sweetest of rewards
The best rush I have felt

Ten men are dead by my feet
I smell their streaming blood
And I smile, cause it makes me...
...makes me feel so good

They were crawling on their knees
Begging for their pathetic lives
Now their souls belong to me
As well as their eyes

Each man has something that I crave
I eat their steaming eyes
And drink their blood to make them my slaves
At Oden's feat in afterlife

I bring the skulls to my shrine
Where silent Gods stand guard
Soak them in blood and in wine - A sacrificial ritual

One thousand heads are on display
Collected through years of thirst
Macabre trophies from my prey
Picked clean of flesh by Oden's birds

I am - I am - A wolf in human shape
I am - I am - A predator with flaming rage

[Lead Mikkonen]

I'm a wolf in human shape - Every man is prey
A predator with flaming rage - Blood is in my trace

I will die with sword in hand
And then my seat's secured
When Oden calls from golden hall
He will greet me at the door


4. Vs The World


One we were scum of the Earth
Now we've cleared our names
In Nifelheim came rebirth
Baptized in Mount Doom's flames

A decade now we've fought this war
Never yielding from our path
Our journeys take us to foreign shores
Where we let our metal blast

We've been battered and left for dead
We've been beaten and we have bled
But we always made it through - Vs the world
This may be our last quest
Before we're put to rest
The end is coming soon - Vs the world

Warriors of the grave took us south
Hell bent on genocide
They made us face the brutal truth
This would be no easy ride

Grotesque creatures of the sky
Met with us on winter fields
Christian god cast aside - Massacre of hallowed eve

We've been battered and left for dead
We've been beaten and we have bled
But we always made it through - Vs the world
This may be our last quest
Before we're put to rest
The end is coming soon - Vs the world

Persian demons brought us south
On merciless campaign
We've raided the western shores
Always going against the grain

All these years we've fought to win
And sometimes almost died
I tell you now we won't give in
Without a vicious fight

We've been battered and left for dead
We've been beaten and we have bled
Versus the world


5. Across The Rainbow Bridge


My days are numbered: soon I have to leave
The Norns have stretched my living thread
The notion of my demise won't leave me be
Why cannot death just set me free!

I've lived a life or prosperity
But I'm not as young as I used to be
Down the road waits misery
Why cannot death just set me free!

Countless armies have I attacked
Not once have I backed down
And though I've spilled a lot of blood
I never once received a mortal wound

I've raided shores in many lands
I cannot count the men I've killed
So many friends died with sword in hand
But the warrior's death was never granted me

I dress myself in battle clothes
Alone I make the final ride
My sight is blurred, by whipping snow
I seek to end my life

I want to walk across the Rainbow Bridge
And see my fathers in the golden hall
They beckon me to join their feast
In my dreams I hear their call


6. Down The Slopes Of Death


Down the slopes of death he rides
The eight hooves pound like drums
Darkness reigns the crumbling sky
Invasion has begun

Fields of flames greets his eye
He smells the fear and pain
Of dying men in agony
It can drive a man insane

All enemies flee his spear
No bow nor axe do harm
Allfather rides out on fields of fear
When Heimdal sounds the alarm

But on the field waits his fate
Foretold in ancient times
A beast with sharp yellow teeth
And hateful burning yes

Today he'll draw his final breath
The wisest God of all
His son will avenge his death
Iormundr's brother will fall

He knows now what is to come
No use to try and run
What is to be, let it be done!
What is to be, let it be done!

Today he'll draw his final breath
The wisest God of all
His son will avenge his death
Iormundr's brother will fall

Down the slopes of death he rides
The eight hooves pound like drums
Darkness reigns the crumbling sky
Invasion has begun

Down the slopes of death he rides
The eight hooves pound like drums
Darkness reigns the crumbling sky
No more is the sun


7. Thousand Years Of Oppression


He hung on the windswept world tree
Whose roots no one knows
For nine whole days he hung there pierced
By Gugnir, his spear

Swimming in pain he peered into the depths
And cried out in agony
Reaching out he grasped the runes
Before falling back from the abyss

He gave himself unto himself
In a world of sheering pain
So that we all may live our lives
By the wisdom that he gained

You doubted him, and spread their lies
Across the world, with sword in hand
You raped our souls, and stole our right
All for the words of mild-mannered man

You listened to mild-mannered god
And put your faith in deceitful words
Your powertrip was paid by blood
In kindness' name you spilled our blood

I refuse to submit
To the god you say is kind
I know what's right, and it is time
It's time to fight, and free our minds

Let me die without fear!
As I have lived without it
So shut your mouth and spare my ears
I'm fed up with all your bullshit

After a thousand years of oppression
Let the berserks rise again
Let the world hear these words once more:
"Save us, oh lord, from the wrath of the Norseman"

Our spirits were forged in snow and ice
To bend like steel forged over fire
We were not made to bend like reed
Or turn the other cheek

He grasped the runes, they're ours to use


8. Bloodshed


Midgard's cold and hatred reigns
Hunger and disease
Fenris is set free again
Chaos is unleashed

The storm of death sweeps the shores
Famine sweep the land
Ties of kinship is no more
Sons die by their father's hand

Two men meet on battleground
Their eyes are full of hate
By sacred oaths both are bound
Death will be their fate

They share the blood of once proud men
Yet foes they have become
One fights for truth, the other for faith
Perish has begun

Here comes the - Bloodshed
It's the age of - Bloodshed
Here comes the - Bloodshed
It's the age of - Bloodshed

Two brothers meet in battle heat
Both will die to day
No victory and no defeat
Death is their only way

In their eyes is no remorse
They make their final charge
Thrusting their swords with mortal force
Piercing each other's hearts

[Lead Mikkonnen]

Here comes the - Bloodshed
It's the age of - Bloodshed
Here comes the - Bloodshed
Prepare for - Bloodshed


9. ...And Soon The World Will Cease To Be


The Northern wind brings snow and ice
Humans starve and freeze
The Fimbul winter has arrived
And soon the world will cease to be

Brother will be brother's bane
No one shall be spared
All will die. None remain
That is mankind's share

The southern sphere is set ablaze
Muspel's fire is set free
The sun is on its final chase
And soon the world will cease to be

Across the western sky he runs
A wolf so grim and mean
Devours the eternal sun
And soon the world will cease to be

The North Star falls from the sky
Into the deep cold sea
The first of all to fall and die
And soon the world will cease to be

Muspel's flames lick the sky
Hidhægg eats the dead
The Aesir meet in hall up high
And Oden 'quests Mimer's head

Land is swallowed by the waves
Rocks and mountains break
Dead men on the path to Hell
And Yggdrasil quakes

[Lead Mikkonnen]

From the East comes a ship
Loke holds the oar
A demon army with swords that rip
Will join the final war

The army of the dead arrives
Heimdal blows his horn
Calling Gods out to die
Before the world can be reborn


10. Siegreicher Marsch (Victorious March)


[Bonus track]

Zehn schwere Stiefel
ber Grund blutgetränkt
Im Gleichschritt marschieren
Diese fìnf Krieger

Es ist Ihnen gleich
Wie sehr Ihre Wunden
Von feindlichen Schwertern geschlagen
Bis auf die Knochen schmerzen

Die herbeigesehnte Rache
Begangen in Blut
Keine Gnade gezeigt
Keine Gnade gezeigt

Den Schmerz verleugnend
Der wie ein Hammer pocht
Erlitten durch Stìrze
Von erschlagenen Pferden

Kein Anschein von Schwäche
Noch Behutsamkeit
Nicht einmal ein Funke
Von Reue in Ihren Augen

Sie erschlugen die Männer
Nährten Wölfe mit Fleisch
Und jetzt verlassen Sie
Dieses Land Seite an Seite

Jetzt auf dem Heimweg
Fìnf Krieger die ohne Reue kämpften
Diese Geschichte von fìnf tapferen Männern
Wird ewiglich erzählt werden

Nur das Leid bleibt
Nur den Frauen allein
Die Kinder wehklagen
Von nun an lebend in Furcht

Kein Mann bleibt verschont
Kein Haus kein Hof verblieb
Keine Christin ungeschändet
Ihre Kirche von Flammen verzehrt

Rot scheint Ihr Stahl
Von Feindesblut
Erzählend vom Sieg
Der von den Göttern geschenkt

Als Sie wiederkehren
Blutend doch stolz
Brennt der Horizont
Und das Lied erklingt laut

[English translation:]

Ten heavy feet
Walks the bloodsoiled ground
With rhythm these
Five warriors march

No matter how much
The bleeding wounds
From enemy swordcuts
Hurts to the bone

The revenge they sought
Was taken in blood
No mercy was showed
No mercy was showed

They ignore the pain
That hammerlike pounds
From falls, off slain
Horses, to the ground

No signs of weakness
No signs of weariness
Not even a glimce
Of remorse in their eyes

They slew men ruthless
Fed the wolves with flesh
And now they leave
This land side by side

Now they're headed home
Five swordsmen who fought repentlessly
Their story will be told
Of five brave men endlessly

All sorrow is left
For the woman to bare
The children cries
They live in fear

No man was spread
No houses or farm remains
No christian woman unraped
Their church consumed by flames

Their steel shines red
With enemy blood
It sings of victory
Granted by the Gods
And as they return
Bleeding but proud
The horizon burns
And the song is ringing loudBlood gushes from the wound
The cut is wide and deep
And before I turn around
He falls to his knees

A clear song rings in the blade
When steel meets hardened steel.
I hear the sound of wood that breaks,
A swords cuts through my shield.

I drop the shield and grab my axe,
A weapon in each fist.
The first blow makes the helmet crack,
The axe cut to the teeth.

I rip the axe from the head,
covered in blood and brains.
Leave the body lying dead,
Ready to strike again.

My sword cuts through clothes and skin,
Like a hot knife cuts through snow.
I smile as the bastard screams,
when I twist my sword.

Sword in my hand,
Axe on my side.
Valhall awaits,
Soon I will die.
Sword in my hand,
Axe on my side.
Valhall awaits me,
When I die.
Bear skin on my back,
Wolf jaw on my head.
Valhall awaits me
When I'm dead.

I raise my axe above my head,
My eyes stare in furious rage.
Yet more blood will be shed,
This is a victorious day!

Blood gushes from the wound,
The cut is wide and deep.
As I turn around,
I fall to my knees.

Sword in my hand,
Axe on my side.
Valhall awaits,
Soon I will die.
Sword in my hand,
Axe on my side.
Valhall awaits me,
When I die.
Bear skin on my back,
Wolf jaw on my head.
Valhall awaits me
When I'm dead.


2. Runes To My Memory


We rode the rivers of the Eastern trail,
Deep in the land of the Rus'.
Following the wind in our sails,
And the rhythm of the oars.
No shelter in this hostile land,
Constantly on guard.
Ready to fight and defend
Our ship 'til the bitter end.

We came under attack,
I received a deadly wound.
A spear was forced into my back
Still I fought on.

When I am dead,
Lay me in a mound.
Raise a stone for all to see
Runes carved to my memory

Now here I lay on the river bank
A long, long way from home
Life is pouring out of me
Soon I will be gone.

I tilt my head to the side
And think of those back home
I see the river rushing by
Like blood runs from my wound.

Here I lie on wet sand,
I will not make it home.
I clinch my sword in my hand,
Say farewell to those I love.

When I am dead,
Lay me in a mound.
Place my weapons by my side
For the journey to Hall up high
When I am dead,
Lay me in a mound.
Raise a stone for all to see
Runes carved to my memory


3. Asator


Thunder rolls across the plains,
Thor rides in pouring rain.
He rides to Jotumheim to fight
Lightning strikes when Mjölner bites.

Fire! Burning in his eyes
Fire! His hate is pure, see the lightning strike
Fire! Burning in his eyes
Fire! His hate is pure, see the lightning strike

Lightning cracks the blackened sky,
Hear the thunder chariot ride
All brave men with hearts of war
Ride the path of mighty Thor

Son of thunder!
Lighting strikes
Son of thunder!
Son of thunder!
Thor Arise!
Son of thunder!

Son Of Oden
Thundergod
Master of War
Asator!

[Solo Söderberg]

Fire! Burning in his eyes
Fire! His hate is pure, see the lightning strike
Fire! Burning in his eyes
Fire! His hate is pure, see the lightning strike


4. Hermod's Ride To Hel - Lokes Treachery Part 1


[Hermod:]
Ride Sleipner
Ride for all you're worth
Faster then lightning,
To the dark realms of the world

Through valleys of darkness
On our way to Nifelheim
To the halls of Hel
Where my brother waits

Wailing voices on the wind
Urging me to turn
Distant tortured screams
Cold blue fires burn

I hear the sound of river Gjoll
Running cold and deep
It's a golden bridge shines in the dark
The bridge that Modgud keeps

Over the bridge, on through the night
Hel is getting near
There are the gates, towering high
Afflicting me with fear

In her hall, at the honor seat
My brother sits in pain
Pale and tortured Balder greats
Bound by invisible frozen chains

[Hermod:]
I have come, to bring him back with me
The whole world mourns his death!
Please set Balder free
Give him back his breath!

[Hel:]
If it's true, what you say to me
That the whole world mourns his death.
If the whole world will weep I'll give him back his breath!


5. Gods Of War Arise


Darkness flees the rising sun
The village lies ahead
It will wake to a new day soon
Soon they all be dead

We came in cover of moonless night
Fifty man at arms
Now at first morning light,
The church bell sound the alarm

Sacrifice to Gods of old
Bleed them of their lives
Fresh blood on our swords
Gods Of War Arise!

Sacrifice to Gods of old
Bleed them of their lives
Fresh blood on our swords
Gods Of War Arise!

Hear the tortured screams
Shattering the air
They awake the soothing dreams
Into their worst nightmare

Fire sweeps their homes
They feel the dragons breath
Consuming and destructive flames
Agonising death

Some seek shelter in the church
A refuge for those with faith
But we know how to smoke them out
A pyre will be raised

But those who choose to stand and fight
Will die with dignity
For the unfortunate few who survive
Waits a life in slavery

The day draws to an end
The night comes dark and cold
We return to our ships
With silver, slaves and gold

We gave them agony, as they fell and die
The gods have granted victory
For our sacrifice

The day draws to an end
The night comes dark and cold
We return to our ships
With silver, slaves and gold
We gave them agony
As they fell and die
The Gods have granted victory
For our sacrifice


6. With Oden On Our Side


Finally the storm arrives
Out wait is at an end
Under dark winter skies
We make our final stand

For each of us, there are four of them
It matters not to us
We won't leave this field in shame
We are here to crush!

[x2]
Futile to resist
You know why we have come
Futile to resist
The battle is already won!

Our hearts are full of pounding rage
Our mind hard as steel
Right before the dying day
We will have you kneel

The snow turns red from all the blood
Severed limbs and heads
A sacrifice to one-eyed God
He will claim the dead!

Under the winter skies
We stand glorious!
And with Oden on our side
We are victorious!

No retreat, no remorse
Victory will be ours
Blood on steel, sacrifice
Victory will be ours

Under the winter skies
We stand glorious!
And with Oden on our side
We are victorious!

[x2]
Futile to resist
You know why we have come
Futile to resist
The battle is already won!


7. Cry Of The Black Birds


Raise your swords up high!
See the black birds fly!
Let them hear your rage!
Show no fear!
Attack!

Charge your horses across the fields
Together we ride into destiny
Have no fear of death, when it's your time
Oden will bring us home when we die!

The ground trembles under us
As we make our thunder charge
The pounding hooves strikes blinding fear
Into their heart

Our helmets shine in the sun
As we near their wall of shields
Some of them turn and run
When they hear our frenzied screams

Draw your swords to strike
Hear the Black Birds cry!
Let them feel your hate!
Show no fear!

(Attack! Attack! Attack! Attack!)

Charge your horses across the fields
Together we ride into destiny
Have no fear of death, when it's your time
Oden will bring us home when we die!

The enemies are in disarray
Ride them down as they run
Send them to their violent graves,
Don't spare anyone
Dead and wounded lie all around,
See the pain in their eyes
Over the field an eerie sound,
As we hear the ravens' cry


8. Under The Northern Star


The icy winter is creeping near
Dark skies above us
Biting frost in the air
Darkness surrounds us

The cold piercing autumn breeze
Fills the longships sail
Soon the lakes and seas will freeze
And snow will lay its veil

Many years we've been away
Many oceans we have roamed
Now the North star guides us on our way
As we are heading home

The many hardships we've endured
Have brought us rich reward
Now the North star guides us home
With cargo full of gold

Many friends died on the way
Only few of us survived
But I would gladly take their place
In Odens hall up high

[Solo: Söderberg]

The icy winter is creeping near
Dark skies above us
Biting frost in the air
Darkness surrounds us

Soon the lakes and seas will freeze
And snow will lay its veil
And we will long for the summer breeze
Where we can set our sails


9. Prediction Of Warfare


Ships were prepared
Weapons and shields
Sails were raised
We headed out to sea!

Norway disappeared in the east
Our journey had begun
Helpful winds gave us our speed
Under a warming sun

Heading to the emerald land
A fleet of 50 ships
An army of two thousand men lead by the king

On the horizon dark clouds arose
Thor rode across the black clouds
As the night rolled in over us
We felt the wrath of the storm

That night I was haunted by dreams
An omen, of what was to come
The serpent arose from the sea

Ready to strike
With hammer in hand
The serpent in pain,
twisting in furious rage!
Fought for its life
The serpent escaped
Thor was in rage
My dreams began to fade

Woke from dreams
Sword in my hand
The break of dawn
We were closing in on Irish land
Time to attack
Grabbed our shields
We came ashore
And saw the waiting horde

The fight was short and deadly intense
The Irish fought us well
But as we gained the upperhand
Their fighting spirit quelled

Ready to strike
With swords in our hands
They struggle with heart
The Irish fell to our wrath
Fought for his life
Their king escaped
With fury divine
King Olaf threw his sword


10. Where Silent Gods Stand Guard (Live At Wacken)


[bonus disk track]

The last head falls to the ground
No one is left alive
They thought that they could take me down
But it's not my time to die
I wipe the blood from my sword
And slide it in my belt
This is the sweetest of rewards
The best rush I have felt
Ten men are dead by my feet
I smell their streaming blood
And I smile, cause it makes me...
...makes me feel so good
They were crawling on their knees
Begging for their pathetic lives
Now their souls belong to me
As well as their eyes
Each man has something that I crave
I eat their steaming eyes
And drink their blood to make them my slaves
At Oden's feat in afterlife
I bring the skulls to my shrine
Where silent Gods stand guard
Soak them in blood and in wine - A sacrificial ritual
One thousand heads are on display
Collected through years of thirst
Macabre trophies from my prey
Picked clean of flesh by Oden's birds
I am - I am - A wolf in human shape
I am - I am - A predator with flaming rage

[Lead Mikkonen]

I'm a wolf in human shape - Every man is prey
A predator with flaming rage - Blood is in my trace
I will die with sword in hand
And then my seat's secured
When Oden calls from golden hall
He will greet me at the door


11. Death In Fire (Live At Wacken)


[Bonus disk track]

The wait is soon at end
Always charge never bend
Morning is here, make your stand
Live for honor, glory, death in fire!
Total war is here
Face it without fear
Age of sword, age of spear
Fight for honor, glory, death in fire!
See the fire rise
Flames are raging high
Soon all will burn and die
Burn for honor, glory, death in fire!
Storm of lethal flames
Only death remains
Ragnarok is closing in
Die for honor, glory, death in fire!
Forces of chaos is on the move
Everyone, choose your side
And know the end is coming soon
The day for all to die
The day is here when Bifrost breaks
Nor sun or moon will rise
When the dead rise from their graves
and Surtur spreads his fire
All you know will wither away
And sink into the sea
A new world will be born one day
Where everyone is free

[Lead Söderberg]

Total war is here, face it without fear
Age of sword, age of spear
Fight for honor, glory, death in fire!
Storm of lethal flames
Only death remains - Ragnar?k is our fate
Die for honor, die for glory
Die, death in fire!


12. With Oden On Our Side (Demo)


[bonus disk track]

Finally the storm arrives
Out wait is at an end
Under dark winter skies
We make our final stand
For each of us, there are four of them
It matters not to us
We won't leave this field in shame
We are here to crush!

[x2]
Futile to resist
You know why we have come
Futile to resist
The battle is already won!

Our hearts are full of pounding rage
Our mind hard as steel
Right before the dying day
We will have you kneel
The snow turns red from all the blood
Severed limbs and heads
A sacrifice to one-eyed God
He will claim the dead!
Under the winter skies
We stand glorious!
And with Oden on our side
We are victorious!
No retreat, no remorse
Victory will be ours
Blood on steel, sacrifice
Victory will be ours
Under the winter skies
We stand glorious!
And with Oden on our side
We are victorious!

[x2]
Futile to resist
You know why we have come
Futile to resist
The battle is already won!


13. Hermod's Ride To Hel - Lokes Treachery Part 1 (Demo)


[bonus disk track]

thunder ride
make your time
ride for all you have
the enemy of mortal men
No time to loose
Eternal time above me
evil in the dark
as they ride to neiflheim
to bring their brother back
wailing voices haggle the wind
begging me to turn
distant tortured voices scream
cold blue fires burn
I hear the sound of river Gjoll
running cold and deep
its golden bridge burns in the dark
the bridge that Modgud keeps

over the bridge
on through the night
Hel is getting near
there are the gates towering high
I'm broken without fear
in her hall at the honor seat
my brother sits in gloom
pale and tortured baulder greets
bearing a face of doom
Oh!!!!!!

I have come to bring him back with me
the whole mourns his death
we beg of you
set baulder free
give him
back his breath

if its true
what you say to me
that the whole world mourns his death
then ill take in the whole worlds whim
I will give him back his breath


14. Once Sent From The Golden Hall (Sunlight Recording)


[bonus disk track]

Rumbling thunder cracks the sky
And rain starts pouring down
Lightning strikes a cold bright light
Upon the blooddrenched ground
The sword play is hard
And many fall
Steel bites sharp in flesh
And upon a mountain
Towering tall
Stand the messengers of death
Five horsemen in armour bright
Waiting in the flashing light
Looking down upon the field
Where Vikings fight with axe and shield
On stallions black as night
With eyes burning red
They ride with thunder to the fight
Deliverance of certain death
A warcry loud as Heimdall's horn
Echoes across the land
Enemies who hear it freeze to the bone
Friends of doom proudly stand
They ride faster than the wind
With lightning speed they strike
Black ravens follow where they've been
To feed from those who died
With power they wield their swords
As they ride down fleeing men
Sending them to Hel's dark court
To never come back again
The warriors ride once more
To the mountain from which they came
Once sent by the gods to war
And they never return in shame
1. Når Hammeren Heves
Skjult bak tidens slør
Fins en tid vi ei minnes
Der ulmer fortidens glør
De er slukket
Men de finnes
Vaart land forsatt blør
Til korset det er bundet
Men vi kjemper til vi dør
Til korset er forsvunnet

Hammeren heves
Mot korset skal den slå
For over Norges land
Skal ei kvitekrist rå

Med sverd og skjold og kraftig hand
Skal han knuses av de få
Sanne sønner av vårt land
Som skal engang Valhalls porter nå
Kvitekrist sin tid skal ende
Med ham går den falske tro
Vi skal mot det gamle budskap vende
Som Valfars land vil vårt land gro

Under hammerens tegn vi lever
Økser ,sverd og skjold vi bærer
Stolt vår fane høyt vi hever
Odin og de hoeye æser vi ærer
Valkyrier som over de ærede haller svever
Skal bringe oss inn i de falnes hærer

2. Når Aftensolen Rinner
Fjorders dyp og dalers sokk
Gaper opp mot Nordstjernen
Stillhetens kryptiske lat trer frem
Nar aftensolen rinner
Huldra vandrer under Gnipaheller
Trollsang gjaller i asers sider
Lyn farer austfra
I gnisters inferno

I fra nord ser man lyset fra himmelens hvelv
Det nordre skimmer apenbares i kveld

Opp fra skogtjern stiger nokken
For barn a lokke med felespill
Og hente dem ned i tjernets dyp
Dette er Norge nar aftensolen rinner

Ulvar og Grimar vandrer i nordnattens dyp
Sprer vold og ve i sin vei
Jager barskogs skapninger og husmann med
Deres oyne lyser i gulglods galskap

Thonar rir over Jotunheim
Dodsguden har sitt aerend
Snart skal jotuns skitne blod
Dekke jotuns mark
Nidhogg flyger lavt
Over ulend mark under stjernehimmel
Nattens dad er fullendt
Lik henger i hans fjaer

EINHERJER LYRICS


1. Dragons Of The North
As blood for wolves for riches and lust
Onward with hammers to chest
Villages burn, burn citys to dust
And for fun they tortue the rest

Cold, blue steel through a nice day's breast
An avalanche of heathnes set sail
To show to the world of which men is beast
To conquer where others would fail

Odin is working to eagerly form
A great heathen fist from the north
Pray for your life when there's signs of a storm
But praying won't help when the dragons com forth

Roaming the bow, the berserks, the fierce
They know not fear of pain
Women and children are swimming in tears
While the berserks are going insane

Scholared embodies by blood and the mound
The clink of sword sound death chord
Bearslough and wolfslough are shaking the ground
Embraced by might, great northern horde

Odin, great warlord, I greed you with hail
This new god is weaker of class
Grant me thy powers, your secrets unveil
And I'll kick this christ right in the ass

2. Dreamstorm
For ages I have drifted
Through storms & mists of grey
With knowledge I've been gifted
path to lead me way
Alone in realms of shadows
My solitude I seek
I poison therefore my arrow
aim it at the weak

Silently I welcome
The glorious mis of dreams
Time to send the heroes home
Their end justify my means
Dawn of death, tears of chaos
Echoes in my mind
It pleased me, I am satisfied

Closing in on death's desire
Through I am not alone
With me comes my fear & fire
a destiny unknown
My twilight affects me
Drifting still in dreams
A gate appears in front of me
Weary visions floats in streams

Come my winds - My Dreamstorm
Soon shall I forever sleep
Pale have I become
Who shall for my fading weep
For faded I have done

3. The Forever Empire
I still dream of paradise
I still wake up crying
I've seen the sun, of tomorrow rise
I felt like I was dying
I still dream of forever
I still see me wave
From the deepest pits of never
Another soul to save

I still long for the sun to rise
I still fear the dark
I've seen the signs of our last goodbyes
Another submerging ark
In bitterness I've tasted my tears
A burnt out soul of emptiness
I loneliness I've touched my fears
closed my eyes for hopelessness

Sail the waves of lunacy
Bring my presence out of never
The forever waves of my time to be
I set my sails for forever
Sail the waves of silent sea
In empty winds under rainbow fire
The forever winds won't let me be
Wake me up from my forever empire

I am my paradise
Through my damnation you'll fall
I am the wise
In my eternity I am all
You ask of me my sanity
Divided you shall fall
Your soul shall burn most certainly
Below me you will crawl

I am my own eternity
My creations will not fall
Dream or not it's real to me
Your becoming I prevail
From my fists burns my fire
The emperor of my empire
Butt where will be a better day
Even I am doomed to fade away

Sail the waves of lunacy
Bring my presence out of never
The forever waves of my time to be
I set my sails for forever
Sail the waves of silent sea
In empty winds under rainbow fire
The forever winds has left me
I am fading through the stars, my desire

4. The Conquerer
Waiting for the morning
For the sun to climb the mountains
For the wind & the waves to answer my call
My sword lays beside me
My ship lays ashore
But few to fight by my side

The snow is slowly falling
And gently caress my skin
Where the steel ripped my flesh
Mu quest is now ended
My home for my awaits
Where she prays for my return

When the winds are calling me
I raise my sword with pride
Full of hate & agony
Through the storms I ride
Fear is not yet known me
Fight me & you'll see
The vikingblood is strong in me
The conqueror I'll be

Rans web is avoided
Tall mountains salute me
Home is home again to me
I know by now
What matters to me
And those involved knows to...

Thunderstorms are raging
Across the churningsea
Towards the northern sky
Awaits the northern stars
The four winds are gathered
Legions of pride awaits me
As I hail the land of frost

5. The Fimbul Winter
On the other side we'll stand
We're the strong
In another world we'll meet
You'll be suffering one
On the other side we'll fight
With swords of steel
In another world we'll win
You'll worship us and kneel
You'll be the suffering one
On the other side we'll fight
With swords of steel

Then a storm shall arise
Turning the skies black
Send up a howling wind
Across the churning sea
That's just the beginning of
What awaits us all
The next three years shall be
Without summer or joy to man

The sign shall be - The blazing sky
The sign shall be - The grimmest cold
The sign shall be - The freezing winds of frost
The sign shall be - The Fimbul Winter

On the other side you'll meet
Blades of steel
In another world you'll meet
Axes swung by hatred strong

On the other side you'll fight
The gods alliged
In another world you'll fall
Our wrath will find you all
Axes swung by hatred strong
On the other side you'll fight
The gods alliged

With fire and frost
We'll tear your limbs apart
With hammers and swords
We'll crush your warrior
With wisdom and strength
We'll conquer your troops
With hunger and pain
You will remember us

Bright shall shine the sun divine
And unsowed field shall grow
Trees shall grow and rivers flow
Through woods as green as man
Has ever seen
Brighter every day she'll shine
The Mother of our lives
Though I don't want to live to see
The day Ragnarok take our lives away

6. Storms Of The Elder
Awaken thou one eyed God
Rise again from the slumber!
Give us a touch of the elder strenght
Flowing in your veins
And give us again the courage to crush
The embers of the faded ones

A lightning ripped the sky
The signs of ancient beliefs enlighten
The inner chambers
Of forbidden knowledge
Oh, rise the storm of elder

Let again Gungnir fly
Into the chests of Giants,
And release again thte power
Of your eight-leggend horse
Ride again in front of the Oskorei
And lead fear into hearts of men
Enlighten the path for those of the elder spirit
And quide them into glory

We entered a long gone and forgotten valley
It's habitants flames of lie long gone
Ceased by a dark and ancient plague
In the heart of this forbitten place
We awakened the spirit of the past
And we entered the dawn
Of the slumbering one

Odin opened his eye
And looked out into the world
He lifted his arms to the sky
And called for he other gods
And commanded them to awaken
From their ages of slumber
Again their rose from the ground
For there where still embers
Of the lost faith of them
In the halls of Valhalla

7. Slagel Ved Hatrsjord
Hørte du i Hafrsfjord hvor hardt de sloss der,
Storættet konge og Kjotve den rike?
Knarrer kom øsfra, lystne på kapplek,
Med åpende kjefter og krot på staunen

De var lastet med hærmenn og hvite skjold
Med vestrøne lanser og velske sverd
Berserker remjet der striden raste,
Ulvhedner ulte og jernvåpen skalv

De fristet den framdjerve, han lærte dem flykte,
Østmenns storkonge, som Utstein bor
Da strid var i vente, snudde han havhestene,
På skjold det hamret, før Haklang falt

Lei av å verge landet for Luva,
Den halsdigre kongen tok holmen til skjold
De drog seg under setene, de som var såret,
Satte stjerten til værs, stakk hodet i kjolen

På baken lot de blinke blanke skjoldtak,
De tenksomme segger, da steinene slo dem;
Austkylvene aste avsted over Jæren,
Hjem fra Hafrsfjord - husket på mjøddrikken

[English translation:]

The Battle At Hafrsfjord1

Did you heard how noisily they fight in the Hafrsfjord
The noble-kin king and Kjotvi the rich?2
Ships came from east, craving for battle-game
With opened mouths and sculpture on the prow

They were loaded with warriors and white shields
With western lances and celtic3 swords
Berserkir roared where the fight rose
Ulfhednir howled and shook the iron-weapons

They wanted to defy him, but he taught them to flee
The bold western king , that lives in Utsteinn
Then the fight was awaiting, he threw the sea-horses5
On the shields he hammered, before Haklang6 fell

Tired of standing beyond the land of Lufa7
The stout-neck king8 took as shield an isle
They cast themselves under the seats, those who were wounded
Put buttocks to the air, stuck the head in the keel

They let shine on their back bright palace-tile9
Thinking of being wise, when then stones hit them,
The eastern clubs10 hasted away by Jaeren,
Leaving the Hafrsfjord - thinking about the mead

8. The Ballad Of The Swords
Across the moor
We Norsemen rode
& skalds to us sung
That days of glory
Soon should be
When swords bloodred were swung
"One-eyed father
Give us the strength
My brave kinsmen & I
In Valhalla I
Your mighty men will meet
If in this battle I die
From the sky
Your ravens watching me
Both of them I see
Thank you father
For letting me know
You watch over me"
At the moor
The ravens spoke to me
While skalds did their song
A bitter loss
Was soon to come
For those I were among

Across the moor
We Norsemen rode
& skalds to us sung
That days of glory
Soon should be
When swords bloodred were swung
I say to you I ask you to
For once be your own lord
Come with me
Be part of my
Ballad of the swords

A sudden clash
Where swords were drawn
Was the beginning of my end
With a norsemans pride
& courage I fought
I would to Hel them send
Instead I felt
Cold chilling steel
Stab me from behind
A cravens deed
Indeed it was
Peace he should not find
Faded I did
Strange beauty I met
The dream for me came true
Brought up I were
Bifrost I saw
My mortal life were through
Your mortal life
With children & wife
Wouldn't have no value
If you knew as I
About life up here
You would die to be here forever

EINHERJER LYRICS


1. De Sorte Sjøers Land
[Lyrics by Rune Bjelland]
[Music by Gerhard Storesund]

Min søkens hjemmel
Mitt sorte hjertes savn
er kommet til en ende
Mitt øye har funnet
Mitt nordre dunkle dyp
En lang tids vandring er omme
her ved de sorte sjøers land
vil mitt sinn bebo

De eldste skoger er lagt meg bak
Deres langstrakte skygge legger seg
Som det dype teppe det er over meg
Og skjuler meg og min sjel
Her ved de dystre sjøers rike
Hvor det hinsidig mørke rår

Som jeg synker ned i det sorte gap
Gir de frosne dyp meg sitt kalde kjærtegn

Det hinsidiges mørke haller hilser meg med sitt silkesorte
Det slukker omsider mitt legems glør , som bor langt her inne
i mitt sorte hjertes slør.
Det gamle riket jeg nå har funnet
Min tilfredsstillelse er dyp

En gyllensvart stjernehimmel åpenbarer seg
for mine stålblå øyne
Men jeg skjønner nå at alt hva jeg må er tilbake
Til de dype sjøers land

[English translation:]

The Land Of The Black Lakes

The heaven of my search
The loss of my black heart
Has reached an end
My eye has found
My northern dark depth
A long time wandering is over
Here, in the land of the black lakes
My soul will live...

The oldest forests are far behind me
Their long shadows lay down
As the deep carpet it's over me
Hiding me and my soul
Here in the land of the gloomy lakes
Where the beyond darkness rules

As I'm sinking down into the black gap
The frozen depths give me their cold caress.

The beyond darkness’ halls hail me with their silk black
It finally stops the sparks of my body, that live in here.
In my black heart.
The old kingdom, I've now found it
My satisfaction is deep.

A golden black starry sky makes itself visible.
To my steel blue eyes
But now I understand, that everything I have to, is to get back.
To the land of the deep lakes.

2. Aurora Borealis
[Lyrics by Frode Glesnes]
[Music by Gerhard Storsund & Frode Glesnes]

A freezing winter sweeps the land
A creeping frost sets in
The fog encircles the castle
Surrounded by a total silence
Black clouds weigh upon from above
The candles are the only lights
The trance is getting deeper
Reaching upon thy mighty thrones
Then an iceblue shimmer hits the wall
The wind whistles a melancholy tune
Feel their presence
Oskorei

During dark and stormy nights of winter
You may see the lights of Thule
Aurora Borealis

Crossing the wastes of the northern fields
Frozen by the cold that paralizes the will
Enter the darkest depths of the northern woods
Tormented by the heat of the hellburning flames
Black moon rising from the sea way up north
Wotan rides across the sky
His fallen warriors hails him high
A freezing winter
A creeping frost
Black moon rising
Thy mighty thrones

3. Witchking
[Lyrics by Rune Bjelland]
[Music by Gerhard Storesund]

On the northern winds I ride
Under a dead and pale sky
With a black cloak of ravenwings
That carry me over the gloomy hemisphere
In the darkness of destruction
Lays an old and cold creature
Maimed by the power of the witchking
Bearer of the floods of heathen sorcery

An aerial servant meets me there
Beyond the dimension of fear
And guide me to this darkened place
Of heathen sorcery

The witchking is drawing nearer
Slowly returning from his tomb of hellburning horror
Demons of demensions turn their their heads
To the mist avoiding his eyes of delusion
A blast of a fireball burns my suffering soul of madness to dust
I can no longer see but I hear the snearing laughter as I slowly cease
Possessed by the power of darkness
Brought to him by the ancient crafts of pagan fears

4. Einherjer
[Lyrics by Rune Bjelland]
[Music by Gerhard Storesund & Frode Glesnes]

Fra sin sjels side han vandret
Over heden han gikk
Med valkyriene ved sin side
Til Vahall der han ære fikk

Inn i haller av sten han entret
Her inne bak livets speil
Tyr trådte frem og tok ham med
For å lære ham opp og en einherjer han ble

Valkyrienes sang vekket ham opp
En einherjer han ble

Tappert han kjempet
Ved sine frenders side
All motstand av jotner
Knust av en mektig hær

Einherjer - Styrt av Tyr
Einherjer - Odins vakter
Einherjer - Valhalls hær

[English translation:]

From the side of his soul he wandered
On the other world he went
With the valkyries at his side
To Valhalla, where he got honour.

In halls of stone, he went in
In here, behind the mirror of life.
Tyr thread before him, and took him with him.
To teach him, and a einherjer he became.

The valkyries' song woke him up.
An einherjer he became

Bravely, he fought.
At his friends' side
Every resistance of Giants
Crushed by a powerful army

Einherjer - Controlled by Tyr
Einherjer - Odin's guards
Einherjer - Valhalla’s army

EINHERJER LYRICS


1. Out Of Ginnungagap
When Ymir lived
A long time ago
Was no sand nor sea
Nor surging waves
Nowhere was there earth
Nor heaven above
Only Ginnungagap
And grass nowhere
The sons of Bur
Then built up the lands
Created the great
Midgard to be

Out of emptiness
Out of Ginnungagap
Came Yggdrasil
Came life
Out of emptiness
Out of Ginnungagap
Came all of what is today

The sun turned from the south
Sister of Moon
She did not have
Nor Had the Moon
A notion of what
Powers they had
A counsil were gathered
Where names were given
The night and the nightfall
And the morning they named
The mid-day, mid-winter
For the assigning of years

Bur had three sons Vile, Ve and Odin
They killed the giant Ymir and founded what we know
They gave us life, spirit and wisdom
Odin owns us all and we owe all to him

When Ymir lived
A long time ago
Was no sand nor sea
Nor surging waves
Nowhere was there earth
Nor heaven above
Only Ginnungagap
And grass nowhere
The sons of Bur
Then built up the lands
Created the great
Midgard to be

Out of emptiness
Out of Ginnungagap
Came Yggdrasil
Came life
Out of emptiness
Out of Ginnungagap
Came all of what is today

2. Clash Of The Elder
I saw creation
Laws of the nature
I saw the world with pride

I saw the fire
Scorching flames of Muspell
I saw the darkest tide

I seek the wisdom
The nature of Yggdrasil
I sought and gave my eye

I saw the Vanir
Granted the twisted truth
I felt the world to die

Ride, Gods of war,
death to the Vanir

Swordsting and axe of blood
Dance with us now
Swordsong will roar to call

[Angerboda:]
"Wonders of my vision
We crave a bloodred mound
A thousand deaths to them all"

Brothers of vengance
The world is a wound
A wound that bleeds and burns

I saw my brothers
Fall of creators
All for what greed thus learns

Ride, Gods of war,
death to the Vanir

Weapons of wonders
Crafted by dwarves
Clouds break from the sky

Fall to your knees now
Bow before me now
Those who deny will die

Spit in this jar of wisdom
Those who swear alligiance
Brave or just ready to die

Thus was created
A scent of wits and poetry
Storyteller of the High

Ride, Gods of war,
death to the Vanir

3. Odin Owns Ye All
I sit by the fires gleam all by myself
Four empty chairs & one've been kept warm
I drink to my kinsmen who sails now with Njord
I drink to my kin who'll drink here no more

Odin owns ye all

I sing to them songs I wish their best on their way
I'm sure a valkyrie found them in the battle that day
I drink to my kinsmen who fought bravely at sea
I drink to my kin who'll be missed not just by me

Odin owns ye all

To arms To arms - The kinsmen said
They've chosen to meet us in battle today
Fight Fight - The kinsmen said
If we show true norse courage they'll soon run away
Wrong Wrong - The kinsmen thought
You cowards are fourty men may you rot in Hel
Rise Rise - The valkyries said
Odin decided this day you would die

I drink to my kinsmen
Who sails now with Njord
I drink to my kin
Who'll drink here no more
I drink to my kinsmen
Who fought bravely at sea
I drink to my kin
Who'll be missed not just by me

Odin owns ye all

4. Remember Tokk
I am the one of battles reason
I left this world my mothers corpse
I am the eyes and heart of treason
My lullabye the screams of horse
I am the haunting and the hurting
I read the walls of memory
I am the fist in the face of glory
I grow and my fire with me

Hark! Is that the battles horn
Has Ragnarok been born
Fire runs my passion burns
Love cries as death comes
Is that the frost and fire
Giants of south and those up higher
Fire runs my passion burns
Fear breakes and chaos rules

I am the incarnation of all ages
I've seen it all & of reason
Some of you may trust in me
And some of you may know that;
Stones & earth swore an oath
As did iron and all kinds of ore
Some cried tears but Tokk did not
She did what she could why ask for more

Hark! Is that the battles horn
Has Ragnarok been born
Fire runs my passion burns
Love cries as death comes
Is that the frost and fire
Giants of south and those up higher
Fire runs my passion burns
Fear breakes and chaos rules

My children might be known to you
Some might even met them too
Guilt is mine in words not felt
Wisdoms sons presence lack
Mother father which am I
Ask my sons wolf or death
I will guarantee
This is not the last you've heard from me

I've felt the taste of poison
Water wet I breathe like air
I caused the earth to rumble
And soon the end of all you know
Some of you may recognize
My skills in lies and betrayal acts
The very same might find it strange
My brother is the wisdoms face

Hark! Is that the battles horn
Has Ragnarok been born
Fire runs my passion burns
Love cries as death comes
Is that the frost and fire
Giants of south and those up higher
Fire runs my passion burns
Fear breakes and chaos rules

5. Home
Across the brigde of colours born
Of fire water and air
Dressed in crimson armours
In hand are bloodwet spears
Reach the entrance heavens gate
Honoured by the brave
See the hall with golden roof
The home allfather gave

Welcome to the hall of death
Great Odin we hail him
Come in, enjoy the glorious afterlife, my friend
Here we fill the ranks of Tyr
Battle is our way
Every morning day and night till the winter fiercest come

Cattle die
All men are mortal
But word-fame never dies
Nor a noble name
Kinsmen die
All men are mortal
But one thing never dies
The glory of the great dead

Enough of tears, enough of wail!
Not to lament in was Valhalla made
The wind as fresh as the air is clear
The greatest of men are here
All einherjer in Odin's court
Fare to fight each day
Select the slain, then leave the battle
Sit after at peace in the hall.

Welcome to the hall of death
Great Odin we hail him
Come in, enjoy the glorious afterlife, my friend
Here we fill the ranks of Tyr
Battle is our way
Every morning day and night till the winter fiercest come

Cattle die
All men are mortal
But word-fame never dies
Nor a noble name
Kinsmen die
All men are mortal
But one thing never dies
The glory of the great dead

6. The Pathfinder & The Prophetess
[The Prophetess:] 
Who is this man, who for me is unknown
Who forces me to go such a hard way
I am covered with snow, beaten by rain
I am wet through by dew
& death I have known for a long time

[The Pathfinder:]
I am the pathfinder, accustomed to battle
For whom is the hall decked here in Helheim
Silence not prophetess, I seek your answers
Who shall bring death to the son of Odin

[The Prophetess:]
For Balder the mead
A drink for the noble
I was forced to speak
Now silence is my name
Hod shall guide him
Shall be his bane
I was forced to speak
Now silence is my name

[The Pathfinder:]
Tell me this, who shall punish this deed
Kill Balders killer and place him on the pyre
[The Prophetess:]
A child, one night old, shall kill Balders killer
Not wash his hands nor comb his hair
Until the fire burns
[The Pathfinder:]
Tell me this; What maidens are those,
Who weeps such heavy tears?
[The Prophetess:]
You are no Volve, but a mother of giants.
Right you are Odin
See you after the wolf

[The Prohetess:]
For Balder the mead
A drink for the noble
I was forced to speak
Now silence is my name

Hod shall guide him
Shall be his bane
I was forced to speak
Now silence is my name

7. Inferno
Cold this night as you feel your fright
The horns of doom resound
White knight shines and you know why
The sky burns the giants light
Winter ends but what will come
The wolf the serpent the end
This the time for You and I
All Einherjer are gathered to fight

See the ship from Helheim comes
See the dead with Hel in front
I can't believe - Then the sun went down
Hear the roar - The wolves age
The clink of sword - death's rage
Brothers shall be brothers bane
In the end you kill in vein
Do you believe

An old oak shakes and its wisdom too
Waves are eager to feed
Gods falls as men so do men
The children of Loke the same
Some will be missed some will not
Some live forever in memory
The sun turns black as our mother drowns
The sky is touched by flames

See the ship from Helheim comes
See the dead with Hel in front
I can't believe - Then the sun went down
Hear the roar - The wolves age
The clink of sword - death's rage
Brothers shall be brothers bane
In the end you kill in vein
Do you believe

Now death is the portion of all doomed men
Shields clash and sharp swords bleed
Yggdrasil trembles it groans in woe
Red with spilt blood giants as gods
Garm howls at Gnipaheller
Fumes reek, into flames burst
The heavens split open
Well, would you like to know more...

I can't believe - Then the sun went down
Hear the roar - The wolves age
The clink of sword - death's rage
Brothers shall be brothers bane
In the end you kill in vein
Do you believe

8. A New Earth
She sees arise
A second time
Earth from the sea
Dressed evergreen
Fairier than all
Waterfalls flow
As from a dream
For us it still is

Once again strangely wonderful
Golden chessmen be found again
On the ground where brave men fought
Owned by Gods a long time ago

Future will meet
The present and past
Speak of winters
The first and the last
Tales of what's been
And what to come
In remembrance of Odin
And the runes of the past

Once again strangely wonderful
Golden chessmen be found again
On the ground where brave men fought
Owned by Gods a long time ago

She sees a hall
Fairier than the sun
Thatched with gold
For trust to dwell
There shall innocence
Forever live
A life of joy
Until the dragon reappears

EINHERJER LYRICS


1. Norrøn Kraft
Larmen stod under himmelblå
Der vest i havet, litt på utsiå
Jernet beit så folk og fe
Blei bleik om nebb og rød av blod
Agg og Nag og ulvhedner
La te rette for sista verst
Hilste hirden med rause spyd
Og jaggu fant dei døden der

Gamle tonar, djupe tonar
Lat det hemska ut av deg
Eg dyrke mitt, eg skyr pesten
Født i åndå, ei i truå
Eg står støtt på norrøn grunn
I kraft av tanken på vår tid
Runer rista for lenge siden
Av oss, for oss

Stolte Ryger krangla hardt
Sverdå sang te solå sank
Ravnen festa på friske sår
Fagre bølger slo mot strand
Årer knaka, jernleik braka
Stridsmenn rei stavnhesten
Spydvær vakte og hilste hardt
Larmen steg med malmstriden

Gamle tankar, djupe tankar
Eldes vrede tapte nå
Skjebnetråden spant seg ut
Glemselens havn lot meg gå
Eg e norrøn av natur
I tanke, vilje og i sinn
Mann i hjerta, mann i ånd
Klar for skjebnens neste trinn

Tosken trur han støtt ska leva
Om han skyr seg vel for strid
Men Alder gir han ingen fred
OM han så bli spart for spyd

Einherjer, falt som menn
Einherjer, norrøn kraft

Gamle drømmar, djupe drømmar
Sjeleild øve Bifrost bru
Opp mot høyden, inn i hallen
Viljen vet å lika seg
For kvar dag og kvar natt
Hender rød under himmelblå
Berserkergang og Heidruns mjød
Kraft i åndå så i sinn

Eg står støtt på norrøn grunn
I kraft av tanken på vår tid
Runer rista for lenge siden
Av oss, for oss
Eg e norrøn av natur
I tanke, vilje og i sinn
Mann i hjerta, mann i ånd
Klar for ka en så komme nå

Den sterkes lov
Den høyes tale
Dei gamle hov
Den norrøne kraft

2. Naglfar
Ein mørk skygge i et tåkehav
Ein trussel i horisonten
Ein storm full av skarpe klør
Som et åpent sår så blør og blør

Ormen piske sjø
Knar bølger og piske sjø
Stavnhesten rir i fra øst
Stormen puste tungt
River i seilene, puste tungt
Dødsseilaren hogge i havet mot vest

Brorsvik og ørneskrik
Bleike nebb nappe i lik
Regn og tåke, negler og hud
Fillete seil bere dystre bud

Stavnhesten rir ut av tåkehav
Død menn i mengder ombord
Stygge, råtne trellbundne lik
Røsker og river i fredens borg

Ormen piske sjø
Knar bølger og piske sjø
Stavnhesten rir i fra øst
Stormen puste tungt
River i seilene, puste tungt
Dødsseilaren komme

Brorsvik og ørneskrik
Bleike nebb napper i lik
Regn og tåke, negler og hud
Fillete seil bere dystre bud

3. Alu Alu Laukar
Fiandene slår på skjoldet
Sa me i alle fall då
Trampe, skrike fra det holdet
Våpen krenke våpen hardt
Vær gjest under min øks i natt

Spyd og sverd ler og danse
Sa me i alle fall då
Hogg mot det du ser og sanse
Hogg mot det så bite på
Dei gladaste øksene vil rå

Prøv å tella dei som falle
Eg høre mine egne hærskrik gjalle

Alu alu laukar

Bara gi meg et spyd
Eller noke så e brukanes
Eg vett det komme flere
Så vil hevna meg når eg dør

Bara gi meg ein atgeir
Eller noke så e duganes
Eg kjenne rusen stige
For eg merke at eg blør
Bara gi meg et spyd

Alu alu laukar

Me samle oss i flere flokkar
Sa me i alle fall då
Det er stoltheten så lokke
Fram den siste rest av trass
Viljen min står ennå fast

Slå nederlaget om te seiere
Sa me i alle fall då
Tap te lykke i et hogg
Våpen krenke våpen høyt
Fra utkikksposten høres fløyt

Alu alu laukar

Bara gi meg et spyd
Eller noke så e brukanes
Eg vett det komme flere
Så vil hevna meg når eg dør

Bara gi meg ein atgeir
Eller noke så e duganes
Eg kjenne rusen stige
For eg merke at eg blør
Bara gi meg et spyd

Alu alu laukar

4. Varden Brenne
Det brenne ein ild
Eller et jærtegn om du vil
Et klart signal
Djupt fra mitt hedenska hjerta
Me glømme dei ikkje
Verken dei fysste eller dei siste
Dei så puste på oppgjørets glør

Se lyset bak jordas rand
Skinna i blod og brann

Da ska usådde åkrar voksa
Ondskap batna, og balder ska komma
Ser hu komma andre gongen
Jord av havet, evig grønn

Eg leve i nåtidens skygge
Lengte itte fortidås arv
Stumme rop så ingen andre kan hørra
Varden brenne
Djupt i mitt sin
Djup i mitt norrøna hjerta

Se lyset bak jordas rand
Skinna i blod og brann

Da ska usådde åkrar voksa
Ondskap batna, og Balder ska komma
Ser hu komma andre gongen
Jord av havet, evig grønn

Det brenne ein ild
Eller et varsel om du vil
Et glimt av rødt
Djupt fra mitt norrøna hjerta
Hørre du stillhetens økende kraft
Et glimt av rødt
Djupt fra mitt norrøna hjerta

Eg ser varden brenne
Under hammerens tegn
Eg ser varden brenne
Og kraftå våkne te liv

5. Atter På Malmtings Blodige Voll
Eg stirre blindt ut i mørket
Noke har endra seg
Eg lytte i mørket
Noke har nærma seg
Opp, eg må opp
Varden lyse nå
Himmelen leve
Er det ufred te gards

Himmelfjellet åpne seg
Skjebner ska vevas nå
Sverdlarm i vente
Greie du å holda ut?
Ut, eg må ut
Treet strekke seg
Uredd og sterk
Eg ska nok holda ut

Atter på Malmtings blodige vold
Står staute stolte karar
Det norrøna kvad fra tiå før tid
Ska atter på Tingvollen klinga

Eg går foran
Eg kan, eg vil
Med håve heva
Eg står for mitt
Atter på vollen
Lite ska sparas
Tenn kampens ild
Tid for Malmting e nå

Brått ende ferden
Fra marenes verden
Vargskinn ule
Natt møte dag nå
Alt unda is
Ufred øve alle mann
Norg og ner
Slag i slag

Jernrier rase
Ufred øve alle land
Larmen står
Harmen herje
Runer råde
Ramt er de rista
Den vindkaldes sønn
Ler av solås skinn
Atter på Malmtings blodige voll
Står staute stolte karar
Det norrøne kvad fra tiå før tid
Ska atter på Tingvollen klinga

Eg går foran
Eg kan, eg vil
Med håve heva
Eg står for mitt
Atter på vollen
Lite ska sparas
Tenn kampens ild
Tid for Malmting e nå

6. Balladen Om Bifrost
Når solå rinne gripe eg
Itte gnistane i Ymes skalle
I lenker eg mane frem ein tanke
Ein tanke så går ut te alle

Bak kvar ferd te Bifrost minne
Står tusener igjen
Bak det svik mot den norrøne gløden
Står tusen år igjen

Eg trur på nye tankar
På nye norrøne spor
På ein drøm om livet, om sviklause ættar
Om ein sal fagrare enn sol

Når striden stilne så volvå seie
Og Fimbulvinteren har gått sin gang
Ska nye tider fylla manns minne
Og gamle sangar ska syngas om og om igjen

Fe dør, frender dør
Ein dør sjøl på samma vis
Eg vet ett så aldri dør
Dommen øve kvar ein død
Fe dør, frender dør
Ein dør sjøl på samma vis
Ord om deg ska aldri dø
I ærefullt ettermæle

Kim e med meg i kampen her?
Mot sviket og mot pesten
Mot eiterormer så vrir seg rundt
Og gjør livet surt for resten

Kim føre dei hengtes ord?
Kim vil reisa stångå?
Hørr meg nå alle ættar
Alle dokkår der ute så brenne

Me møtes på vollen ein siste gång
Vinden viser vei
Der nye tider ska fylla manns minne
Og gamle sangar ska syngas om og om igjen

Fe dør, frender dør
Ein dør sjøl på samma vis
Eg vet ett så aldri dør
Dommen øve kvar ein død
Fe dør, frender dør
Ein dør sjøl på samma vis
Ord om deg ska aldri dø
I ærefullt ettermæle

EINHERJER LYRICS


1. Far Far North
Northwards and netherwards
Where towered a dreary palace
She, the ruler of misty Hel ere waiting for you in the hall of death
Hoartfrosted sick-bed hordes trudge
Murderers and oathbreakers
On a crowded path of death yes, to Hel comes the most.

Betrayed be her father, her mother be distress
Mournful beauty, her face half black, half flesh
Tears of sorrow falls like pearls onto the ground
Odin: Send her far away and let her evil do no harm
Send her to Niflhel, to theuttermost peak
Her blood can never in this hall of honour reek

Far Far North
North of Ginnunngagap
Where she rules supreme
In lonely majesty
Soak shall be her home
In death's eternal winter she alone
Welcome to her frosty home
Far Far North

On the ness I now stand
Oh, death would be so sweet
But my fate was rusty sealed
My vengance comes wrapped in sleet
My powers but grow and grow
Come to me, come to me
Ragnarokkr I shall sow
When all chains break I'll be free

Children red with weeping and a howling bloodsmeared hound
Wrapped in Bedridden saved a place for the weak
Across the burning bridge and through the gate of Hel
Horrid visions the prophetess saw from where the dead from Hel decend
Many men entombed in frost in the ninth realm
Into the deepest pit she saw

A hall she saw stand
far from the sun
It's doors facing north
on Corpse Strand
Drops of poison
dripped through the smoke-hole;
The hall wattled
with serpents backs
She saw there wading
through tubulent waters
Men forsworn
and murderers

2. Naar Hammeren Heves
[Lyrics by Frode Glesnes]
[Music by Gerhard Storesund, Frode Glesnes]

Skjult bak tidens slør 
Fins en tid vi ei minnes
Der ulmer fortidens glør
De er slukket
Men de finnes
Vaart land forsatt blør
Til korset det er bundet
Men vi kjemper til vi dør
Til korset er forsvunnet

Hammeren heves
Mot korset skal den slå
For over Norges land
Skal ei kvitekrist rå

Med sverd og skjold og kraftig hand
Skal han knuses av de få
Sanne sønner av vårt land
Som skal engang Valhalls porter nå
Kvitekrist sin tid skal ende 
Med ham går den falske tro
Vi skal mot det gamle budskap vende
Som Valfars land vil vårt land gro

Under hammerens tegn vi lever
Økser ,sverd og skjold vi bærer
Stolt vår fane høyt vi hever
Odin og de hoeye æser vi ærer
Valkyrier som over de ærede haller svever
Skal bringe oss inn i de falnes hærer

3. Naar Aftensolen Rinner
[Lyrics by Rune Bjelland]
[Music by Gerhard Storesund]

Fjorders dyp og dalers sokk
Gaper opp mot Nordstjernen
Stillhetens kryptiske lat trer frem
Nar aftensolen rinner
Huldra vandrer under Gnipaheller
Trollsang gjaller i asers sider
Lyn farer austfra
I gnisters inferno

I fra nord ser man lyset fra himmelens hvelv
Det nordre skimmer apenbares i kveld

Opp fra skogtjern stiger nokken
For barn a lokke med felespill
Og hente dem ned i tjernets dyp
Dette er Norge nar aftensolen rinner

Ulvar og Grimar vandrer i nordnattens dyp
Sprer vold og ve i sin vei
Jager barskogs skapninger og husmann med
Deres oyne lyser i gulglods galskap

Thonar rir over Jotunheim
Dodsguden har sitt aerend
Snart skal jotuns skitne blod
Dekke jotuns mark
Nidhogg flyger lavt 
Over ulend mark under stjernehimmel
Nattens dad er fullendt
Lik henger i hans fjaer

EINHERJER LYRICS


1. Wyrd of the Dead
[Lyrics by Frode Glesnes]
[Music by Gerhard Storesund & Frode Glesnes]

Wounded
I hung on a wind-swept gallows
For nights all of nine
Pierced by a spear
Odin
Offered myself to myself
Wisest know not
From whence spring the roots

I pledged to Odin
A hanged mans gift

Saw him hang nine days and nights
Pain did blind his sacrifice
More dead than alive
Carve the runes the dead to speak
Enlight the strong desert the weak
The wyrd of the dead

Suffer
A sacrifice so profound
They gave no bread
They gave no mead
Peered down
I grasped the runes screaming of need
I took them
From that tree I fell

I pledged to Odin
A hanged mans gift

Saw him hang nine days and nights
Pain did blind his sacrifice
More dead than alive
Carve the runes the dead to speak
Enlight the strong desert the weak
The wyrd of the dead

2. Doomfaring
[Lyrics by Frode Glesnes]
[Music by Gerhard Storesund]

In a silver shield of frost
Her realm proudly shimmers
Icy wastes and massive mist
Embraced by winds of death
Over the frosty mountains cold
To dungeons deep and caverns old
The seeds were sawn at the dawn of time

More fierce than the dragons fire
Daughter of deaths descendant
In hollow halls beneath the world
Forever kept unlit
Suffer a ceaseless cold
Pain and hunger in her dreary home
Since ages gone for times to come

HORROR - Come horror and soon the awakening
ETERNAL - Come eternity become forever
DARKNESS - Come darkness craving apocalypse
SERENITY - Forget serenity chaos supreme

Eternal darkness, forever night
Shimmering flicker of candle light
Deep down dreary the Hel halls holds
The sepulchral essence of death
Anger and hate are ever awake
"Creator of death created me
Wolf and serpent preeminently"

Hel stands ready to fall upon them,
And seize them as her own
Falling deeper into the abyss
In which she dragged them down
As sure as water lost falls back as rain
The queen of Hel will rise again
And with her the eternally damned

HORROR - Come Horror and soon the awakening
ETERNAL - Come eternity become forever
DARKNESS - Come Darkness craving apocalypse
SERENITY -FORGET SERENITY CHAOS SUPREME

3. Hugins Eyes
[Lyrics by Ragnar Vikse]
[Music by Gerhard Storesund]

I have seen through raven's eyes
Blood spilt on dwarfs-made steel
Young men, old men, ready to die
Brave men's path to higher grounds

I have often heard words of great wisdom
Battle cries ring the fields
I have been through water, air and fire
Seen the hall of Hel, deep underground

I shall not flee, though fated to die
For never have I known - Fear

I've seen foes blind and scared by death
Dead corpses with ropes round their neck
Berzerkers fighting with bare hands
Battle is better than to burn in the bed

I have heard the wolf-of-vows
Chain's break at end of times
Chaos roar through-out mankind
Brutal battle- please the raven

I shall not flee, though fated to die
For never have I known - Fear

Let my body's pyre fill the skies
Take my mark and let it lead you to my hall
Taste the blood in your mouth as you close the eyes
"I shall burn forever" echos in your mind

4. Burning Yggdrasil
[Lyrics by Frode Glesnes]
[Music by Gerhard Storesund]

Blackened cinder black blood of wrath

Dreadful dominion the pit be prepared
Blackened wrath burn its becoming
The pit hath opened the cosmos alight
Split tongues speaks of sadness

Rise from the raging realms of muspell
Set the nine worlds ablaze
Flame feast rage and glow
The fiery world shall show

Burning Yggdrasil

Sinister slaughter the sword of the south
Hard death struggle harsh the world
Through vales of venom torrent poison torment
Fornication be rife

Fire fares with flaring flames
Avengers alliged
Come Muspell with Surt at helm
The elders slaughter

Burning Yggdrasil

See the abhorrent faith determined
Bleeding pleading death and killing
Feel the fire lick your flesh
Feel the rage rush to extreme
Despotic death destroying desperately
Terror tyranny taste the torment
Cruelty crushing crying chaos
The nine worlds burns foes will perish

Blackened cinder black blood of .....

5. Crimson Rain
[Lyrics by Frode Glesnes]
[Music by Gerhard Storesund]

I've had my courage measured
By the great heroic death
Behind a grisly image
A grim and ghastly wrath
A striking portrait hidden
In a cruel and ancient vision
Dark my pride of bravery
Through the eye of Odin I see....

An axe-age,a sword-age.a wind-age,a wolf-age
Before the wrecking of the world

Soared through storm clouds
The force of fate
Weaving the web of war
Nightfall doomfall
Death come forth
Beware the Crimson rain

Precious arts of warfare
Gaining mortal sacrifice
The taste of blood the foaming frenzy
All berserker's rage
Emerging from a bloodred sky
As storming birds of prey
Shrieking Screaming Raging's menace
Catch the blood and await the fallen

My spear spreads fear my sword still kill
A grinding death my will
To be seen to be felt
Who dies first who follows after
My infinite powers like the
Strength of a storming sea
So it is for now and
So shall it forever be

An axe-age,a sword-age.a wind-age,a wolf-age
Before the wrecking of the world

Soared through storm clouds
The force of fate
Weaving the web of war
Nightfall doomfall
Death come forth
Beware the Crimson rain

Sacrifice my life for Odin's court
Grant immortality
Rise again to life the heroic dead
Await the horns sound

In days of yore, in truths of tales then told:
(Odin :)
You and every one of you
Who follow me are born into my clan
I mark as my own.

An axe-age,a sword-age.a wind-age,a wolf-age
Before the wrecking of the world

Soared through storm clouds
The force of fate
Weaving the web of war
Nightfall doomfall
Death come forth
Become the Crimson rain

6. Howl Ravens Come
[Music by Gerhard Storesund]
[Lyrics by Gerhard Storesund]

Tell me, Nikar, thou must know
The fate of Gods and men
When to wield the spear and bow
What omens do you send

In my words take heed
On woeful foes to dwell
Fields of scattered ravens feed
The forceful Gram knows well

Bloodeagle carved
With a bone-biting sword
Song of the wielded
Howl the ravens chord

Many an omen men only knew
Good when swords are swung
Unfailing followers battle through
Dark ravens come along

Heavy weight the second weighs
Arrayed with rage of war
Good if you see two men in race
for victors ancient lore

Bloodeagle carved
With a bone-biting sword
Song of the wielded
Howl the ravens chord

Howl ravens come

A third thing: Good hearing , the howl of a wolf
Carried from an ashes boughs
Good if you first sight thine enemies
Triumph over broken brows

No man in battle, his face shall turn
Against the sister of the moon
Scattered on the battlefield the bleeding burn
Awoken as a victor soon

7. Draconian Umpire
[Lyrics by Gerhard Storesund]
[Music by Gerhard Storesund]

I am called a noble beast
And dim is my name
My keen sword forge a noble feast
Now rests sublime untame

Never as a youth with a weaklings heart
Bravery in age unveil
The conquered thrall of Valfathers art
Freedoms bliss, death prevail

Listen your last
To the sound of my sword
Yours, beheaded
Gram, the dreaded
Grim carnivore
Listen your last
Til your heart sound no more
Fade you hear it
Ridil tear it
Out as you roar

In water drown if in wind thou fare
Doomed men bear misery
Leave my abundance! Away from here!
My penury your bane will be

The countenance of terror left me here
I now await the hoar of Hel to call
No man saved by a helm of fear
No man is mightier than all

Garms howl I hear as I die
Greed has overcome
Curse thee by the ring, I sigh
Your end shall become

8. Regicide
[Music by Gerhard Storesund]
[Lyrics by Gerhard Storesund]

Ridden through the flame
The ring be his bane
The oathkeeper's brother bid
The ringkeeper slain

Fire-raisers hand
The grief and the rage
The ill-fated will had won
The ill-fated wage

Fish of the wild-wood
Worm smooth crawling
With wolf-meat mingled
They minced for him
Then in the beaker
In the wine his mouth knew
They set it, still doing
More deeds of wizards

The fate has overcome
maimed and outrun
The brave breed of the noble son's
Vile unjust done

[Brynhild:]
"Long shall ye have
land and men of war
Thou who now has slain
Sigurds death done"

Now he has fallen
The son of Gods triumphant
Norns have their judgement
Death knell toll
We are the children of the wolf

Fall to your sleep
Thy court of mailcoat's gem
Swift peace reap

The shriek of a raven
Cut through the air
"False oath be thy bane"

9. Oskorei
[bonus track]

Can you hear it?
Can you feel it?
The souls of the dead
Waft away on the winds of a storm.

Rushing through mid-air
The Hounds of the Hunt
It's the procession of the dead
The stabbed, the hanged and the drowned.

The roar of hooves and horns
Pound the skies
Dark omens of doom
Hear their cries
Shivers down your spine
Oskorei
Oskorei

Come join us...
Come ride with us
The dreadful ride
On the track of men
Throughout the world

And will not give up
All faithless should fear
The ride of the dead
Their hunting horns and the raging host

The roar of hooves and horns
Pound the skies
Dark omens of doom
Hear their cries
Shivers down your spine
Oskorei
Oskorei

EINHERJER LYRICS


1. Fremad
[Instrumental]
2. Hammer I Kors
I asketreet
Ein hengt mann
Me vett å nyta arvå
Å leva, å dø
Trekk linjå med meg
Me vandre videre

Pendelen
Pendelen
Pendelen svinge
men aldri i din favør

Øve bruå
Igjønå ilden
Kan du forstå?
Alt har følgt deg
Alt har fylt deg
Du må ut og se

Pendelen svinge
men aldri i din favør

Bytte ikkje hammer i kors
Me brenne samme brann
Blota kraft i tankane
Runene
Ravnene
Hammaren

Viljen tar
Og viljen gir
Heilt uten anger
Buen spente
For å fella deg
Galgen rir igjen

Pendelen
Pendelen
Pendelen svinge
men aldri i din favør

Tanken gir
Og tanken tar
Ladegrep om livet
Å leva, å dø
Trekk linjå med meg
Godt spydvær og sikt bredt

Pendelen svinge
men aldri i din favør

Eg vett noke som vil aldri dø
Eg bytte ikkje hammer i kors
Me brenne samme brann
Blota kraft i hammaren

3. Nidstong
Skjebnen skifte
Frender forgår
Midgard forfalle
Sjøl ormen forstår
For baugen eg ser
Bølgenens bånd
Bruå briste
Smerten for hånd

Vreden friste
For kvar dag så går
Forsømt og fordømt
I mørke ein trår
Det iskalda indre
Klage sin sorg
Frosten får feste
Gjør vesenet veikt

Eg reise
Nidstong - mot ormen i blant oss
Nidstong - mot ulven i aust
Eg reise
Nidstong - mot ormen i blant oss
Nidstong - eg rope ikkje ulv

Eg minnes menn
Midgard igjønå
Gamle garde
Fra opphavets hus
Eg minnes tider
og Volvås vev
Gamle garde
Garden har falt

Eg reise
Nidstong - mot ormen i blant oss
Nidstong - mot ulven i aust
Eg reise
Nidstong - mot ormen i blant oss
Nidstong - eg rope ikkje ulv

4. Hedensk Oppstandelse
Konge, du kan være det hvis du vil
Vær så god, stig opp på din høge hest
Her e skylappar og her e speil
Kim sitt blod vil du ha på nevane fysst?
Fortell meg det!

Grådighet, svik og løgn
Må skjelettå i skapet forklara deg ka det betyr?
Du trur du kan forgifta meg?
Ingen e mindre egna te det enn deg

Me ska samlas igjen
Me har venta lenge nok
Hedra ære og mot
Me ska samlas igjen
Me ska så frøet te ein
Hedens oppstandelse

Lenkene, lenkene ska brytas
På tide å reisa seg igjen
Kampen, ja kampen e i gang
Tusen år må seias e mer enn nok

Gjennom vår tid
Har blodet på nevane dine
Vært vårt
Nok e nok
Det korset det tar eg
For det ska brenna på bålet

Me ska samlas igjen
Me har venta lenge nok
Hedra ære og mot
Me ska samlas igjen
Me ska så frøet te ein
Hedens oppstandelse

5. Nord Og Ner
Treet strakk seg opp og ut
Støtt så fjell - støtt så fjell
Røta seg i farga jord
Djupt og vidt
Ormen lång, den slyng seg rundt
Tettare - og tettare
Eiteren, den forma ord
Nok ein gong

Usselheten vise vei
Den endelause sirkelen
Frender sjølv står stormen ut
Naturens gang
Harme vil ein om seg herja
Vike ikkje - eg vike ikkje
Økså hogg igjen og igjen
Ja, sviket svir

Nord og ner
Dragande
Nord og ner
Dei lokke dei

Det grønna bladet dør for oss
Litt og litt - det dør for oss
Vinter varsla opprøret
Nord og ner
Tanke-rier rase hardt
Hevn i harme - rase hardt
Fagre tonar svinne hen
Og visne vekk

Brynjelause går me fram
I fylkingen - går me fram
Fure værbitt står me der
Når det stige fram
Alltid ska eg følga med
På ravnene - på ravnene
Ormen hogge igjen og igjen
Ja, sviket svir

Nord og ner
Dragande
Nord og ner
Dei lokke dei

Det va sånn det va
Den siste dagen
Nåken gjekk i forveien
Me visste det
Det måtte skje
Naturens gang

Eiteren, den forma folk
Nok ein gong
Den forma folk
Eg slår ikkje røtter i fremmad jord
Nord og ner

6. Nornene
Høgt her oppe i lyset eg står
Utøve, nerøve
Der dagen blør ut
Alle krigers vitne, eg e
Långt ner i mørke eg ser

Kom det så va
Kom det så e
Kom det så komme
For alt det dei vett
For alt det dei ser

All kraft te rotå
All kraft i lyset
All kraft te rotå
All kraft i yggdrasil ask

Långt ner i mørke eg ser
Skjebnespinnar, livbinder
Nåken trenge ei djupare grav
Du spør meg mer enn eg vett
Hør meg; det er mørkere enn du trur

Kom det så va
Kom det så e
Kom det så komme
For alt det dei vett
For alt det dei ser

Høgt der oppe i galgen me hang
Ubundet maktlause
Når dagen blødde ut
Alle krigers vitne visste nok
Nornene hadde talt

7. Trelldom
Eg ser ansikter
Eg ser døden
Blod på horisonten
Eg ser ravnane
Eg ser deg
Du flyte i luftå

Føle ingenting
Tørre tårer
Blod på hendene
Eg er alltid
På vei ner
Det tynge...

Norrøne sinn i trelldom
Flammane brant blodrød
Norrøne spor i trelldom
Ingen arr kan skremma meg

Høre stemmane
Tause skrik
Et hav av tenkte tankar
Ingen ære
Ingen frykt
Ein skog av skjøre minner

Eg ser lenkene
Følge sporå
Så djupe, så gamle
Eg ser ravnane
Eg ser meg
I speilet i vannet

Norrøne sinn i trelldom
Flammane brant blodrød
Norrøne spor i trelldom
Flammane brant blodrød

8. Av Oss, For Oss
Her, men ikkje lengre
Kun ulven fare fritt
Se djupt inn i flammen
Det e sannhet i det du ser
Eg følge stien
Mitt hjerta, min æresmark
Du kan sei ka du vil
Det sirkuset ditt kan brenna

Hør hornet gjalla
Skyggen falt på oss
Se ner i brønnen
Det e sannhet i det du ser
Fremmad e krigsropet
Det tale blodets røst
E du klar?
Detta e vår plass

Ingen vits å be for oss
Tråden e spunne
Tusen arr, ingen anger
Når skjebnen spille seg ut for oss
Står me samla
Av oss, for oss

Sønner og døtre av hedensk blod
Kast runene
La røttene gro
Nøkkelen e din
Brødre og søstre av norrønt blod
Kast runene
La røttene gro for deg
Himmelen brenne
Varden brenne for oss

Så blir det stille
Så blir det mørkt
Se kvelden kvela dagens glød
Og det blir ro
Se skyggen stiga
Se såra gro
Og flammane
Flammane vekkes igjen

Sønner og døtre av hedensk blod
Kast runene
La røttene gro
Varden e tent, og viljen o
Brødre og søstre av norrønt blod
Kast runene
La røttene gro for deg
Himmelen brenne
Varden brenne for oss

EINHERJER LYRICS


1. Einherjermarsjen
[Instrumental]

2. Ironbound
Feel the of taste of hate release its bitterness
Caught up in a place to face the fate
From below taken, trapped and tied in chains
Serpent spewing venom from above

The serpent never stop spitting out its searing venom
Not for a minute, not for a moment
Striving not to gasp
Striving to surmount the pain
Striving not to let the woman
know how much her brief run costs

Ironbound - The torture never stops
Ironbound - Held hard, held in horror
Ironbound - The torture never stops
Ironbound - Through bonds of blood

Bound I am with bowels torn from my kin
To bring the torment closer to my eyes
Writhing in pain, causing quakes in chains
Prepare the fall of all, I call to arms

By my hand come the end and the chaos
At my touch the green leaves withers
Hurry to your end
You who ween yourself so strong
I feel a luring lust
to consume the ones who tamed me once

Oath-bound to Odin in blood but beware
If in truth I am gut-bound to rocks
Know that first and last I am
Bringer of death and of doom

3. Dead Knight's Rite
As thunder borne upon the wind
Was heard the battle's wild uproar
See the angels of the dead
Seek blood dripping crimson red

Amidst the heaps of foemen slain
Drenched with battle's bloody rain
On the plate-mail rattled loud
The arrow-shower's rushing cloud

Spear-torrents swept away
Ranks of foes from light of day

In the dark the spears were whet
Grimly pointed metal shone
Dread the weapons of the knights
Battered shield and blood-smeared swords

Ravens, rain-soaked lurked the feast
Nesting redly the deceased
Grim the jaws that shook their shields
Red the fangs that bit the bones

Spear-torrents swept away
Ranks of foes from light of day

4. Wolf-Age
Axe-age Økstid
Sword-age Sverdtid
Wolf-age Vargtid

I saw the doombringer coming to call
In form of the blind
And the arrow of fraud
Pierced through the skin of the fair
In accents of despair
As he died away
Borne throughout the misty air
The sun turned pale and no one spoke
Vows were sworn that very night
This death will be avenged

I saw the ship burning floating away
As a funeral pyre
To be claimed by the sea
A biting sarcasm rose
Whence the sly one fled
Hence the bondage of blood
Burned throughout the misty air
Ringhorn disappeared and no one spoke
Vows were sworn that very night
This death will be avenged

I saw the darkness descend upon the nine worlds
To enhance the coming of the end
All-Father then stod up and addressed upon the nine worlds
Axe-age, Sword-age, Wolf-age

Northwards and netherwards for nine nights through darkness
And through the vastness of Vid
Towards the ninth realm for nine nights through darkness
Axe-age, Sword-age, Wolf-age

Northwards and netherwards the eight-hooves were pounding
Through mist and pathways of death
Across the burning bridge the eight-hooves were pounding
Axe-age, Sword-age, Wolf-age

I felt the darkness increase upon the nine worlds
The winter tighened its grip
Grim Fimbul rage addressed upon the nine worlds
Axe-age, Sword-age, Wolf-age

I saw the wolf-age coming to call
In form of the blind
And the arrow of fraud
Seeds of destruction were sowed
By the hands of doom
And by daring the meek
Tears thou kept to thouself
To avoid his return
To be wept of out Hel
Shields shall be cloven in vain
For this act of deceit
As the fate has forseen

5. The Eternally Damned
Hear me Doom-bringers
Pale-bleak spawn of Hel
Await the seething tide…

As a venomous omen
An eagle pecks at the dead
Its beak dripping blood…

At dusk death will dawn
Denoument hoist the sail
Skin and nail prevail...

6. Ware Her Venom
“Fear rule my world still
Has ruled it, shall rule it
Meek is weak”
Ill-boding wolfs blood
Crowned in woe, death-stained
Dread-gard Queen

Sear the runes of wrath
The rependant writhes in remorse
Niflhel - Ware her venom

To be taught by tongue of treason
Hoping nothing knowing nothing
Ware her venom

Serenely cold-blooded
Death embedded skin
Wrapped around death-sin
Words of unwise men
Pierce all senses
Pain, yes pounding pain

Hear the screams of deceit
The Half-dead sneers in delight
Niflhel - Ware her venom

To be taught by tongue of treason
Hoping nothing knowing nothing
Ware her venom

7. Hammar Haus
Djupe skogen, Loke-skrall
Jotun frista hammar-skrall
Mjøllne brest hugens hallar
Fjell og dalar drottens drønne-kall
I Utgard; Ake-Tor
Følget råka Jotun jord
Niding pest i Lokes hallar
Gny hirden, Tor i kallar med nid

Hammar Haus - Hammar-Ty
Rimkolde Rungne ramma
Ramme raus - Hammar-Ty
Rimkolde Rungne ramma

Utgard-Lokes falske leik
Ei ussel, ei veik - Åsa-Tor

Huge ga Tjalve strid
Strauk han grunnen lett som vinden
Ingen grid i utgards hallar
Traust Tjalve beintrøtt tok sitt mot
Loke ei hell vil ha
Loge brenner lukt som ilden
Ingen list i Åsa-kallar
Balders bane taus mot Muspells ve

Havets larm i det mektige mjødhorn
Stort om stavnen
Mein i den mektige
Æges arge velde
Hatefullt står imot havets harme
Om alle land
Ligger Jormundgand
Med eiter om juvande kjeften

Elle - Arge eldes velde
For alders føtter alle faller
Ei håp om grid
Synkverv - Utgard-Lokes list
Lorrides leik
Loke bleik i Utgards hallar

8. Starkad
I Hordaland ska hærmenn fella blot
Mannablot te Herjans hær
Nidingverk e
Starkads bot

Grimme gamle halvtrolls bane-brodd
Harde hirdmanns lodd
Starkads ætt e
Starkads lodd

Sterk i spydver, hard mot skarpe odd
Bane blir ei banesår
Strid med Hake, Hake stri og rå med
Vebjorg hakehoggar i sin hird

Rik på sår
Odins rause gunst gamle bytting får
Slikk om sår
Odins sterke kunst sterke stridsmann får

Høg ska akta, andre menn ska hata
Tredje nidingverk ska så
I strid ska vokta, fyrsten blod ska lata
Odins stridsverk ska rå

Hogga i halsen
Ser inn i livet
Kløyva i brystet
Innvollar henge
Banemann Hader
Hogge av hausen
Tors gamle ondskap
Bite i graset

9. Ride the Gallows
Galders great, nine Bòltorn gave
Nine lays of might
Drank the draught of Kvasir’s blood
Mead Divine

Word from word gave words to me
And throve full well
Deed from deed gave deeds to me
Ere long prudence came

Runes you’ll find and fateful signs
Strong staves, stout staves
Runes that Galdra-Father stained
Runes of old graved

Word from word gave words to me
How to evoke them
Deed from deed gave deeds to me
How to score them

Ride the gallows of the norns
Born secrets of the dead
Nine runes
Nine lays
Born secrets of the norns

Ride the gallows of the norns
Born secrets of the dead
Nine runes
Nine lays
Born secrets of the dead

10. Ingen Grid
Ormens strid va hard
Jernvåpen skrangla mot skallar
Longspyd luta for liv å ta
Regn av ildpiler falt
I Odins gny

Jernvåpen skalv
Broddar brant blodig i brystet
Malmsterke klinger fra Rogaland
Talte folkets ord
I Odins gny

11. Berserkergang
Hørr de rir et rykte sørfra
Herskjold og herda oddar herje
Kampkloke, hissige kjølskodde hestar
Spydver i vente
Med dragar i stavnen

Malmsterke udyr vente
Gape i sinne med jernkjeft i sky
Bjørn og ulv stille sultne
Sultne på sårleik, berserkergang

Hørr de rir et rykte vett eg
Hermenn med malmspyd rød rundt kjeften
Jernklinger skjelve med blåblanke eggar
Glohondar ete det asketåkå tok

Det mørkna mot økstid for Ryger
I spydting; la jernvåpens larm ramma hardt
Eg vett det svartna for mången
I jernleiks kvasse berserkergang

Med vind i dragens seil
Blei bølger brutt fra vest
Jernklinga skrog
Strøik fram i fjorden
Fra åpne sår fekk blod
Fritt leide te sjø
Og kvast der vest for land
Fløit menn så var kåra te døden

Hørr de rir et rykte sørfra
Kampgny, hissige framlynte fyrstar
Jernklinga skjoldborg i fritt leide fare
For ære og land i Odins navn

12. Venomtongue
False peace
None my friend in word
Batteling bards
None my friend in word
Bloodshed
Ill nature comes to pass
War gods
Ill nature comes to pass

Loke
Untame venomtongue
No ward on words of blaming tongue
Loke
Stinging venom song
No heart, no hope for venomtongue
No heart, no hope for venomtongue

In dismay the One-Eyed gazes
With a grave brow
On the friendship of old
With a bleeding heart
In eyes of cold
Hating, despising

Dawned decay of bloodline alliance
No use to dwell
On a friendship of old
Let the elder spite
and disgrace unfold
Blaming, lying

Enchained
With the guts of your long gone son
Tearing fangs
On the guts of your long gone son
Silence
Come the holy hammers woe
Bones undone
From the holy hammers woe

EINHERJER LYRICS


1. Ferrum Aeternum
[Instrumental]

2. Iron
The silence breaks the ground
A shadow is riding the horizon
An arcane man arrives to town
Remoresless and condemned
Tasted the snake's poison
Broken every bone
Felt a thousand gunshot wounds
But there's nothing that whiskey can't cure

Ride Through the crossfire
Ride Through the flames, like a predator in the night
The eagles fly into eternal sunset
The heroes die, dying for their pride

Awoken to heavy galloping
I heard the blasting whiplash
Eyes are filled with lust to kill
Beware, he's crying out your name
Now the time has come
When the Iron tears the heart
And the trumpets will ring loudly
As the stars are painted with blood

Blazing fire under the moon
Burning taste of lead
We'll ride forever
Cause' the Iron is stronger than death

3. Sword Chant
[Grim man's tale:]
[I:]
A flaming blade of the dark shadows struck the lands
With furious lightning it fell into the hands of man
And the ancient fire came down
Down from the sky into the ground
The clouds moved aside as the sword was cast from the sky
Burnt by a mark of fire, who shall make this find
And the grey clouds were watching down, down from the sky into the ground
...As the shapes of light were drowned

[II:]
Courage's started crowling from the ashes and smoke
And the night was cursed and drifting within the winds so cold
And the knights from the sea were marching down
To the deep caverns down, down where the old spells are found
The war was growing in the old lands and towns
From the mountains war drums pounded with a deafening sound
They'll seek the Sword forevermore, until in battle they'll fall
...Now, hear the battle's call

Who dares to play with death
Who smells the dragon's breath
No grief for the fallen ones
The search for the sword has begun

[Carved in stone:]
Great as the mountains and seas
Grim as the earth and old trees
Made from the glimmer of golden lakes
Chained with fire that never fades
Rocks and stones they carve and mould
When the rivers run fierce and cold
May this chant haunt your past
For this Sword is yours at last

Raise the arms the battle is near
Through the mud and waters clear
The blood is coloring the lands again
A sign of victory the wind will send

4. Mourning Heart (Interlude)
[Instrumental]

5. Tale Of Revenge
He bears a tale so gloom and tragic never to be known
Into darkness now fallen, into hatred now grown
Like stillborn child drifting in the silent seas
Of blood, crushing all his dreams

No castle walls can hold the fury in his eyes
Devotion for death, now controls his life
No gold or silver can bring him consolation
Only one thing is left inside him, the desire of revenge

One light so cold and pale, sleeping quietly all alone
One life so old and gray, wandering away from home

Parted with a horrid cry, snow falls on his grief
United by the sword of wicked screams
What deeds he has done to hear those deadful sounds
In the ruins of memories he wanders, forever bound

Forever bound to death!

Wait for me in the mountains, haunt me in the winds
Wait for me in the land where nothing lives
Until the day I have found revenge, I will feed my sword
Until my heart is cold, every breath of mine is yours

6. Lost In Despair
I was lost, on my own
And I couldn't bear the thought of my life
I was gone, caught in the torturing memories
And they burned like fire
Water can never heal such pain

Can't you believe
Nothing is real
Can't you see
I cannot feel

Take me away
Bury me in the sand
Cause after all these years I am still the same
A sad and bitter man

Crush my hope, grow my hate
There's no home for me
Nothing to give, nothing to say
So tell me it's a dream

7. Slayer Of Light
I have come to unfold your mind
In my veins runs the poison wild
In the streams of mountains I flow
I have opened the doors for unleashed and endless hate
It will burn like the raging green flames
Inside a man dwell secrets so cold

Through the dreadful storms, across the frozen oceans
I have come from the dark lands with sorrow in my hands
The firewind rages in the sky
And my luminous sword hungers for more
I will leave no one alive
For I am the Slayer of Light

I... I will break your will
I... I will crush your faith
I... I will slay your dreams
I will reclaim the stars and I will tear your precious world apart
I will tear it apart

I will pull everything with me under the surface
And all the screams will fade into my dreams
Fall now! Dying light!
I will burn away the ground beneath your feet
And all will be vanished in the darkness
Dying light! Fall now!
And let the night arrive

8. Into Battle
We left our homes behind, now we're following the wolves' trail
Through the deepest forests, beneath the stars we ride
I can see the moon glowing red like the blood of warriors
There's a prophecy, that tonight many men will die
The fire will burn forever in our passionate hearts
Our destinies are calling us now
We are ready to take their lives

Into battle we ride with Gods by our side
We are strong and not afraid to die
We have an urge to kill and our lust for blood has to be fulfilled
WE'LL FIGHT TILL THE END! And send our enemies straight to Hell!

Prominent leaders, cast your swords in the wind as a sign of war
Men, prepare for death, 'cause we might never return

Blood will spill and heads will fall
As the swords sparkle, lights the night
The ground rumbles as we attack
In the throes of rage, we will fight
The lightning's flash, the thunder's roar
Will petrify the weak
We'll show no mercy, we'll kill them all!
We are sworn in the name of steel

9. Lai Lai Hei
[x2]
Hän katsoi maan reunalta tähteä putoavaa
Nyt kauniit kasvot neitosen peittää karu maa
Jokaisen täytyy katsoa silmiin totuuden
Sillä aika ompi voittoisa, mut' tämä maa on ikuinen
[English translation]
He gazed the falling star from the edge of the world
Now the face of the maiden are covered by rough land
Everyone has to look in the eyes of the truth
Because the time is victorious, but this land is eternal

There's a place in the North, far far away
Home for the wandering man
Dreaming fields with skies so pale
Calm is the glorious land
Flames will send the sign to the sky
That we have come to feast tonight
The lakes are echoing with our song
Shadows are dancing on the forrest wall
Shadows are dancing on the forrest wall!

Enchantment of the fire and moon
Lost in the whispering night
The raven's magic enthralls the woods
Crawling in the sweet starlight
We have gathered in this distant land
Full of wisdom, secrets and tales
The morning will never rise again
Roaming wolves are howling for the dead
Roaming wolves are howling for the dead!
Oh yea!

LAI LAI HEI!

Hän katsoi maan reunalta tähteä putoavaa
Nyt kauniit kasvot neitosen peittää karu maa
Jokaisen täytyy katsoa silmiin totuuden
Sillä aika ompi voittoisa, mut' tämä maa on ikuinen
[English translation]
He watched a falling star, at the edge of the world
Now the maiden's beautiful face is covered in barren earth
Everyone has to look into the eyes of the thruth,
For time is victorious, but this land will always stay true

LAI LAI HEI!

10. Tears
Shadows of evening on a traveller's way
Destiny tells where the strange path will lead you
Alone I've been walking this path every day
Under the stars and the white silver moon
I hear a song and I'm closing my eyes
While its sound is carresing my poor and sad mind
Will you tonight give your promise to me
For one day the silence will sleep in your dreams

I've been waiting for so long time
To see the light of the golden bright sun
I feel no sorrow in the heart of mine
For the tears of life are now gone

Winds are whispering in the sacred forest
Dancing and singing with the red autumn leaves
These memories I could never forget
With rising sun I shall be here with thee

11. Finnish Medley: Karjalan Kunnailla - Myrskyluodon Maija - Metsämiehen Laulu
[Karjalan Kunnailla]

Jo Karjalan kunnailla lehtii puu,
jo Karjalan koivikot tuuhettuu.
Käki kukkuu siellä ja kevät on,
vie sinne mun kaihoni pohjaton.

Mä tunnen vaaras' ja vuoristovyös'
ja kaskies' sauhut ja uinuvat yös'
ja synkkäin metsies' aarniopuut
ja siintävät salmes' ja vuonojen suut.

Siell' usein matkani määrätöin
läpi metsien kulki ja näreikköin,
Minä seisoin vaaroilla paljain päin,
missä Karjalan kauniin eessäin näin.

[Metsämiehen Laulu]

Terve, metsä, terve, vuori,
Terve, metsän ruhtinas!
Täss' on poikas uljas, nuori;
Esiin käy hän voimaa täys?
Kuin tuima tunturin tuuli.

Metsän poika tahdon olla,
Sankar' jylhän kuusiston.
Tapiolan vainiolla
Karhun kanssa painii lyön,
Ja maailma unholaan jääköön.

Ihana on täällä rauha,
Urhea on taistelo:
Myrsky käy ja metsä pauhaa,
Tulta iskee pitkäinen
Ja kuusi ryskyen kaatuu.

Metsän poika tahdon olla,
Sankar' jylhän kuusiston.
Tapiolan vainiolla
Karhun kanssa painii lyön,
Ja maailma unholaan jääköön.

The beautiful land opened before my eyes
wild as a beast I ran into the night

The Calling Of The Howling Wind
Is Raging In The Realms Of North
Creations Of Ice Rising Mighty Into The Skies
And Treacherous Gods Shall Fall

Watching through the falling snow
there's no sign of life
The fire has gone out in the whirl of time
Behold the face of thunder
the storm is getting near
When the sky calls my name, I have no fear

They brought us misfortune, but their honor is about to be crushed
My blood flows cold as streams of the North
We'll never let them take our souls
The calling of the howling wind is raging in the North
Creations of ice, rising mighty into the skies
and Treacherous Gods shall fall

Time And Time Again
I Witness The Birth Of A New Born Star
I Climb The Highest Mountain
To Find The Essence Of A New Era

20. Näitä Polkuja Tallaan
[intro]
mä näita polkuja tallaan kai
viimeiseen asti
jos sä rakkaani seisot mun vierelläin
näilta poluilta löytyy se viimeinen rasti
jonne yhdessä kuljemme ystäväin.

[1st Verse:]
En kotiseutua vieraaseen vaihtais
vaik tätä maata niin moni kaihtais.
tää tila isältä pojalle siirtyi
vaikka naapuri omansa myi.
mä kuulin sydäntäin
se sanoi tänne jää
et maailmalta onneas
voi löytää
sä tulit kanssani
yhteiseen kotiin
korpimaata myös
rakastit niin.

[Chorus:]
mä näita polkuja tallaan kai
viimeiseen asti
jos sä rakkaani seisot mun vierelläin
näilta poluilta löytyy se viimeinen rasti
jonne yhdessä kuljemme ystäväin.

[2nd Verse:]
Ei näitä juuria
irroita myrskyt
ei meitä kaada
elämän tyrskyt
me voimme lapsille
jokatin antaa
mitä kaupungin lapset ei saa.
jos kuulee sydäntään,
se sanoo - tänne jää
et maailmalta onneas
voi löytää
se on niin lähellä,
kun sen vain huomaa,
eikä kurkoita merien taa.

[Chorus:]
mä näita polkuja tallaan kai
viimeiseen asti
jos sä rakkaani seisot mun vierelläin
näilta poluilta löytyy se viimeinen rasti
jonne yhdessä kuljemme ystäväin [x2]

[English translation:]

I guess I tramp these paths
till the end
If you, my love, stand at my side
On these paths the last "cross" is found
To where we are heading together my friend

I wouldn't swap my native region to a foreign
Even though so many would avoid this land
This farm passed from the father to the son
Even though the neighbour sold his.
I listened to my heart
It told stay here
From the world your happiness
you can't find
You came with me
to the shared home
Wilderness too
You loved so much

These roots won't
be detached by the storms
We won't be fallen
because of the breakers of life
To the children we can
Give something
That the children from the cities can't have
If one listens to the heart
It says – stay here
From the world your happiness
You can't find
It is so close,
When you just notice it
And not just reach behind the seas.

ENSIFERUM LYRICS


1. Frost
[Demo (1997)]

Howling winds of the North
The cold predator of the fells
Mighty woods of the North
Under cover of darkness
Desolate and dying lands
Barren ground, covered with snow
There forever I am,
Where cold winds blow

Gathering thoughts, take me
Into a whirl of silence
Gathering thoughts, give me
Strength to survive

Wail to me my winds
Fly away with frozen wings
Take my life to your hands
O' cold wasteland... of Frost

Great land of the North
The ice shimmering upon the lakes
Great storms of the North
All life frozen to death
Freezing days of sorrow
I'm alone in this infertile world
In the year before time

2. Old Man
So much farther off than time could reach
Today it would be too late
So much despair he has bled
But will he wither away
No one knows that you must keep
This Old Man wide awake
'cause no one knows that he could feed
Our lives with a brighter flame

[Chorus 1:]
Hush little dreamer, the bearer of light
Has come to set you free
Now little dreamer at last you can sigh
'cause the nightmares will be released

[Chorus 2:]
Sweeter far than life from I found that love was
Sweeter far than love to die as he did
[J. L. Runeberg]

[Repeat chorus 1]

The stars fell from the nightsky
As he reached his hands in the air
As the sun peeked between the trees
The Old Man burst to tears

[Repeat chorus 2]

3. Knighthood
I walk through the calm forest in the time of knights
And only the dark memories are left from these times
There's pieces of armour on skeletons
Of men lying on the ground
They were killed by the stab of the sword

Before me lays thousands of dead knights
Beneath of my feets lays skeletons
And only the dark memories
Are left of this Knighthood

On this ground all fought for domination,
But no one stayed alive
And no one knows why that even one life,
Didn't survive
It must have been the powers of evil,
That killed the rest of the men
On this bloodstained ground,
That which stories has been told

4. The Dreamer's Prelude
[Demo 2 (1999)]

[Instrumental]

5. Little Dreamer
Once there was a boy back in time of the heathens
Day after day he just kept dreaming things that would make him weaker
His father could not make him see, that there is more than dreams
But he wouldn't listen to the words of his father, 'cause he's a little dreamer

Along his quest for solitude
A wise man came and told him to follow the stars

He ran to the forest with whirlwinds by his side
He's lost in this world of lies
Take him back where rivers flow upwards
He is the one who lives under a moonless sky looking for time
Take him back where stars are shining bright

Far in the lands of icetop mountains far on the other side
Pictures are appearing so serenely into my mind
Far in the lands of meadows of fire deep in forgotten life
Memories are drifting away so silently from light

Along his path of misery
A wise man came and told him to follow... the stars
Little Dreamer...

6. Warrior's Quest
(Let me tell you a story of a great warrior...)

Strike with the powers of magic stone
Grab your legacy that you behold
If you can find your destiny
Then you may return back to your home
... Ride away with your mighty horse
Ride away through the land of storms...
Unknown ar the ways of your journey ahead
But with strength and courage you can avoid your death

Throw your sword through the memories
Embracing your bleeding heart
Don't follow the shadows they ain't for real
Like guiding stars

As he falls to eternity the truth is fading
Part of him died long time ago but still there's death awaiting

Go now brave warrior don't look back
The stars will guide you through the night
But even the brightest light,
Won't reach to the darkest night...

7. White Storm
On this dawn the colours of the autumn are reflected by a light
A light that as been captured for years in oblivion

Circles of wind are raging now
And so his powers are slowly dying
Before the coldness rapes the lands
His spirit is wandering into the night... to DIE!

...and he heard chimes ahead playing these enchanted notes,
That lead him to a wooden cabin, where he could rest for the night...

Over the mountains
He had travelled
Across the oceans
Deep in the night
Now when it's time to
Say last farewell
Show us your power
Show us your might
Gift from the sky

His eyes can see it so clearly now
But his restless mind cannot sense it in the air

THE WHITE STORM IS CLOSE!

...and his powers gained in this mystical place more than he ever
Posessed before.
So now he could rule the realms of ice... ONCE AGAIN!

8. Intro
[Hero In A Dream (Demo 3, 1999)]

[Instrumental]

9. Hero In A Dream
A witch read from the palm of his hand
That his life would turn into darkness
And alone he would face all demons
From his past that he tries to forget
An elder king warned of the dangers
That lie in the valleys of north and
His only chance was to find his shadow
So he had to set forth

He is the man who travels in the land
Of dragons and magic spells
He rides in the winds of fire and snow
And he rules the forest of elves

Slash of the golden sword
A flash in the burning night
Curse of the evil lord
He is fighting for his life for the last time

Oh such beauty in time, but it's just external
He cannot see the truth with his eyes, so he is bound by a lie

The snow starts falling in paradise, as he gazes at the stars
He will be born again in the sky, when the night turns into a dawn

On the way to the ancient castle of time
He will soon be damned by rage
So that his pride could betray him
When it's time to set him free
The fears in his mind had to be pushed aside
As he walked through the gates
He will never die
'cause he is truly a Hero in a Dream

10. Eternal Wait
Over the Forgotten sea
Voice of angel is calling for me
Somewhere, where the mountains collide
That's where I'll find my new life

I have carried this burden so long for you
That nothing but sorrow I feel
I have let myself believe
That nothing would hurt deeper than the truth

Never has the wind blown like thousand years ago
Everything that I've known has left me on my own
Never have I felt the rain fall down like the burning flames
All I see is the face of eternal wait

I hear your silent cry
Lost in the rainy night
No reason to live for
One reason to die for

I am the one who has fallen into the path of shadows
(and that road never seems to end)
I am the one who has drowned into the river of tears

11. Battle Song
Let's go

Hear the sound of swords fulfill the night
Feel the winds of death on your skin
See the arrows fly, flaming in the sky
Hear the screams of men, as they die

We won this battle wit might and fearless hearts
We came and we fulfilled our prophecy
So now we shall march back towards our kingdom
With heads up high and glimmering eyes
We returned with our glory

Silence now falls upon this blood red field
Vultures feasting with the flesh of dead bodies
"This is a great moment for all of us
But now it's time to head back home victorious"

12. Guardians Of Fate
Race with the wind
The night is ending
They will win
When the sun is rising
Stories have been told for years about the rebel man
Riding in the lands of unknown
No one has ever seen their furious beings
And their secret remains untold

Their deeds shall be heard
Their legend will live forever
They are the Guardians Of Fate

As they shouted their last battle cries their destiny was to be dead
Their future was in no one's hands like the prophet of the moon had said

Those who travelled far away from home, they'll never return
And those who crossed the seas of hope, they all will burn

3. Token Of Time
Harvest the field of time
with the old man's scythe
The narrow path of the chosen one
reaches beyond life

I set sails for the ageless winds
No fear of dying or a thought of surrender
I threaten every barrier on my way
I am bound forever with Token of Time

Among the humble people
Everything is torn apart
but I'm blessed with faith
and bravely I shall go on

Are thou the bringer of hope and joy
that I've waited for years
I shall fight to restore the moon
Wisdoms of time are carved on the sacred wood

Do thou possess spiritual powers
that would dispel all my fears
I shall not die until the seal is broken
Token of Time is trusted in the hands of the chosen one

Far in the lands of icetop mountains far on the other side

Far in the lands of meadows of fire deep in forgotten life
memories are drifting away so silently from light

Along his path of misery
A wise man came and told him to follow... the stars
Little Dreamer...

7. Abandoned
Sing for your tears
a song of the hatred
No one can hear
'cause your life is forgotten
I want to give my life to you
but my will is tied with puppet strings
I am fighting and screaming alone
inside this empty room
They let you down, threw you in the rain
They let you down, sent you away... without a name

The night is dark when you're alone
and sometimes it can be so cruel
The rain keeps falling on me so coldly
'cause your wishes didn't come true

Nothing seems real anymore
as I dive into the sea of lies
I don't understand this sorrow
that keeps me sane

8. Windrider
He appears from the mists of a dismal lake
and the sky crumbles as he flies through the dimensions alone
The night has laid a cape on his shoulders
and with a grin on his face he attacks with his loyal soldiers, into the unknown

There's no place for him in this world, and no ties
and all this hate and grief unite in his mind

Windrider - seeks freedom with vengeance on his mind
to escape from the crimson skygrave and fly away
Windrider - is waiting for the final day
when he'll be released from the shackles of a slave

In the eye of the storm he rides with jaded memories of his life
as the fires are dancing colorfully, he is struggling to survive
Trapped in a maze, can't get away, what have you became now
Take the hammer of the elders and crush your way out

His presence is shaking the land
as he stands at the mountain peak
His instincts are getting weak,
but there is still hunger in his eyes, that keeps him alive

He wears the mask of the hunted
Arts of light for him have been granted
He lives in the fragments of time
waiting for his time to die
...Windrider...

9. Treacherous Gods
The Land Is Silent... Before The Storm!

On the vast fields of snow, the wind is blowing strong
With its frozen cold and relentless touch
it leaves a dead and hollow land of ice

I have seen through the eyes of a wolf
and felt all its pain and loneliness
The beautiful land opened before my eyes
wild as a beast I ran into the night

The Calling Of The Howling Wind
Is Raging In The Realms Of North
Creations Of Ice Rising Mighty Into The Skies
And Treacherous Gods Shall Fall

Watching through the falling snow
there's no sign of life
The fire has gone out in the whirl of time
Behold the face of thunder
the storm is getting near
When the sky calls my name, I have no fear

They brought us misfortune, but their honor is about to be crushed
My blood flows cold as streams of the North
We'll never let them take our souls
The calling of the howling wind is raging in the North
Creations of ice, rising mighty into the skies
and Treacherous Gods shall fall

Time And Time Again
I Witness The Birth Of A New Born Star
I Climb The Highest Mountain
To Find The Essence Of A New Era

10. Eternal Wait
Over the Forgotten sea
Voice of angel is calling for me
Somewhere, where the mountains collide
That's where I'll find my new life

I have carried this burden so long for you
that nothing but sorrow I feel
I have let myself believe
that nothing would hurt deeper than the truth

Never has the wind blown like thousand years ago
Everything that I've known has left me on my own
Never have I felt the rain fall down like the burning flames
All I see is the face of eternal wait

I hear your silent cry
lost in the rainy night
No reason to live for
one reason to die for

I am the one who has fallen into the path of shadows
(and that road never seems to end)
I am the one who has drowned into the river of tears

11. Battle Song
Hear the sound of swords fulfill the night
Feel the winds of death on your skin
See the arrows fly, flaming in the sky
Hear the screams of men, as they die

We won this battle wit might and fearless hearts
We came and we fulfilled our prophecy
So now we shall march back towards our kingdom
With heads up high and glimmering eyes
we returned with our glory

Silence now falls upon this blood red field
Vultures feasting with the flesh of dead bodies
"This is a great moment for all of us
but now it's time to head back home victorious"

12. Goblins' Dance
Once in the time of chaos,
of sunless days and of unhappiness
The statue of the triumphant master
stood proud and grim
In the light of three descending moons,
it twisted and cracked open
Unleashing the Goblin King,
once again, for the last time

"Now the Victory is ours!"
"Let us dance the dance of Immortals"
They shrieked, as they marched
up and down the hills,
in the sighing face of earth

Misfortune and Chaos,
Grief and Destruction
The works of Dreaming evil,
and the joy of unholiness
No soul was left alone,
in the mayhem of the human race
"Hahahahaa!!!, Let us joy, Let us dance!!!"
So they danced their macabre dances

From the three ascending moons,
moonshine was spilling onto the ground,
Gruesome trophies were all around,
In the halls of the Goblin King

ENSIFERUM LYRICS


1. By The Dividing Stream

2. From Afar
A raven came to me,
Spoke to me in my dream.
A long lost prophecy,
A forgotten legacy.

Echoes of yesterday,
Won't let these dreams fade away.
All the beauty I adored,
At the edge of the world.

Across the universe,
Time is to be reversed.
No shelter can be found,
To this fate, we are bound!

Behold the final hour,
The last times will be dour.
All life falls into gorge
Of the end of the world!

"Burning skies
On the vengeance night.
Devastating scythe,
Of the ancient Light."

I saw the might,
Of the ancient Light!
And the beauty of the perishing world,
Theres no tomorrow.
We have been warned.

"The sky's bird struck fire,
Made a flame flare up.
The north wind burnt the clearing.
The north-east quite consumed it:
It burnt all the trees to ash and reduced them to dust."

3. Twilight Tavern
We heard that enemies were approaching from the south
We marched to face them, I killed their scout
But we were ambushed and slaughtered in the night
We fought so bravely but none were left alive

Now I open my eyes and what do I see
A rainbow in the moonlight, pipers calling me
They say don't be afraid and asked me to follow
You've been expected, so forget your sorrow!

[Chorus:]
Their warrior's souls forever rejoice
TWILIGHT TAVERN!
With our ancestors we raise our horns
TWILIGHT TAVERN!
Their warrior's swords forever shine on
TWILIGHT TAVERN!
Welcoming our brothers at the break of dawn!
TWILIGHT TAVERN!

[Bridge:]
Life is so short (Life is so short)
Oh! son of the north (Oh son of north)
You'll find your peace
At the end of your journey

[Solo]

[Verse:]
Hey! All greet us when we open the door
Familiar faces -- "Brothers, it's been too long"
Beer is flowing, the smell of burning meat
In the morning battle reigns like hell's been unleashed!

As the sun sets behind the mountains peak,
The master of the house shouts: "Drink and feast!"
This feels like it is too good to be true.
The call for the final battle will be here soon

[Chorus]

4. Heathen Throne
This hate inside me,
It is constantly growing.
Years of hollow lies,
Made pagan hatred rise.

They came with their troops,
Destroying land and roots.
Abominations under the sun,
They and their poisoned truth.

One by one my people fell,
Under their deceptive spell.
How many sons of the
Northe, had to fall?
Before our eyes could see;
This isn't how it should be!

"Under the Northern star
We shed our blood.
With the call of a battle horn.
We raise our swords.
Behind the fields of blood,
There's a haven for us.
Deep in the woods of the North,
Rises the Heathen Throne"
[Kalevala]

Upholder of the skies,
For too long has your name been
Despised,
Give us your strength and courage.
When we meet our nemesis.
On the shores that used to be,
The place we called home.

Our land and faith are raped,
Somehow they're going to pay.

Grant us your revenge,
We are not afraid of death.
Let none of them ever more, EVER MORE,
Lay a hopeful gaze upon the sky!

5. Elusive Reaches
Protector of the sun arrives with light
From the edge of the world to the highest heights.
With a thunder blast he greets his twin,
And falls back to oblivion.

From the western plains where nature blooms.
Roams the swift brother in eternal blue.
Chasing the vanishing golden light.
Hasting towards an endless night.

Across the high northern skies
The eldest brother in all his might.
Guards the frozen barren land
With a token of wisdom in his hand.

Forlorn moon and dreadful mist
The youngest brother raises his fist.
All life slowly withers away
And the infinite circle begins again.

The trail of the winds remains unseen,
For mortals their realm stays concealed.
The ageless skies that stand before our eyes,
When we'll be gone they'll still be flying free.

Silvery light of the sea,
Sparkles of far beneath.
Cold breeze against their brawn,
Reminds them of cold steel and war!

6. Stone Cold Metal
Howl of a coyote wakes up a man,
A haggard shadow in this wasted land.
Vultures rise with the scorching sun.
A dry wind blows in a silent town.

Some Whiskey to clear his head
And some for the brothers who are dead.
Another day, another chase,
Vigilantes will meet their fate.

Saddle your steed
We are riding tonight
Be ready to kill
Don't flee from a fight.
Pillaging is in our blood,
We bow to no one and no one at all!

Stone cold metal in his hand,
Stirs wild rival of righteous man.
Life of an outlaw; the gallows await.
Until then they shall reign!

No border is too sacred
To cross and to spill the cup of hatred.
Days to come are still unveiled,
Take whats yours, no time to bewail!

Waning daylight, time to move on
Under a looming crescent moon.
Another town, again to raze,
Surely someone will pass deaths gate.

In the silence of the night
Treacherous lady of the evening,
Deceived the whereabouts of marauders.

Ten bounty hunters are heading to the hideaway.
A dark red desert moon
Shimmers it gloomy light.
Upon a baneful affair of honour.

For a fleeting moment, eye meets eye.
Silent respect before an inevitable solution.
Dead or alive, Its all the same...

7. Smoking Ruins
For many years ago
He left his home behind.
No farewells or a note,
Like a thief he fled into the night.

Heart full of foolish pride,
He caused a death of his clans man
All prophesies he denied,
And now in exile he grieves.

Hear the call of the fallen ones
Wisdom of those whose time has gone
Live your life bravely my first born son,
On battlefields fight, don't run.

The wheel of time keeps turning
A boy becomes a man.
But still shame burns him.
At last he understands.

He heads back to his homeland.
He rides fast like a storm wind
But the flames in the horizon,
Tell there is only death to be found.

By the smoking ruins of his past life.
He raises his hand to the skies,
"Oh god of thunder,
God of my fathers,
Strike me down for what I've done!"

8. Tumman Virran Taa
"Yllä harmaan korven korpit laulaa,
Hurme tämän kansan roudan sulattaa,
Katso kuinka hohkaa kansi taivaan,
Kutsuu se meitä tumman virran taa,
Heikot vaipuu kuohuun sysimustaan,
Sankarit kun astuu joen rantaan,
Halki iäisyyden laulu raikaa,
Kutsuu se veljiä tumman virran taa."

[English translation:]

Above the darkened woods, blackened ravens sing.
As flows the people's blood, to melt these frozen grounds.
See how glows the sky, how curve the heavens above us.
It beckons, calling us, to the lands beyond the Dark Stream.
Those weakened, to the Darkest of Streams shall drown.
And when heroes, those riverbanks will reach.
The sounds of singing, across eternity shall echo.
Calling our brothers, to journey, afar, beyond the Dark Stream.

9. The Longest Journey (Heathen Throne Part II)
Could my ruin have come,
My day of trouble have arrived,
In these tuonele cabins
These abodes of the dead land?
[Kalevala]

Far beyond the dark stream pagan souls will
Roam those cold lands wild and free.
Wait for the sign; a blood red sky.
Then beyond the dark stream we will ride.

The path of mortals,
So narrow and brutal.
Only bravest of them all
Will find true valours

Decaying souls of men,
Who trust in false omens,
Will drown in the stream
With their untrue beliefs.

He's been drifting
For so long,
Searching for the land.
Where heroes roam.

In the horizon,
The last ray of light,
A breeze from the other side,
Before he dies.

Dividing walls of stone,
Eternal heathen Throne,
Beneath the cold starlight.
Revealed for the purest sight.

Through constant affliction
Towards alleviations,
When a searing star is near.
Carry on, you're almost here

Far beyond the dark stream we'll meet again.
Across the wilderness and we will be home.
Gather your strength, don't be afraid.
Far beyond the dark stream, we'll meet again.

The longest journey of them all,
Has to be made all alone
A flame in the skyline reaching the stars
Guiding the seeker through the night!

10. Vandraren
[Digipack Bonus Track][originally by Nordman]Vandraren har ingen stans att gå, när han kommit fram till slutet.
Månen färgar alla skuggor blå, han är ensam kvar där ute.
Långt där borta från en enslig gård, lyser värmen ut i natten.
Väcker hungern i hans frusna kropp, som har levt på luft och vatten.

[Chorus:]
Det gör ont, men gå ändå, du kan alltid vända om.
Det gör ont, men gå ända, du är här och kom hit som en vandrare.

Klockan ringer för en ensam själ, den har lånat röst av döden.
Vill den illa eller vill den väl, när den räknar våra öden.
Sluta tänka det är svårt ändå, du får ta en dag i taget.
Vandraren har ingen stans att gå, om han går vid sista slaget.

[Chorus 2x]

[English translation:]

[The Wanderer]

The wanderer has nowhere to go, when he arrived at the end.
The moon will stain all shades of blue, he is the only one left out there.
Far over there from a secluded courtyard, lit the heat into the night.
Raises hunger in his frozen body, which has lived on air and water.

[Chorus:]
It hurts, but go anyway, you can always go on.
It hurts, but go right, you are here and came here as a wanderer.

Bell rings for a lonely soul, it has borrowed the voice of death.
Does it hurt or want it well, when the count of our destiny.
Stop thinking it is difficult anyway, you may take one day at a time.
The wanderer has nowhere to go, if he goes at the end of the battle.

[Chorus]

ENSIFERUM LYRICS


1. Symbols
[Instrumental]
2. In My Sword I Trust
Many men have crossed my way
Promising peace and my soul to save
But I've already heard it all
I've seen what they made with their freedom
But I, I have no need for your god
The shallow truth of your poisonous tongue
Brothers, it's time to make a stand
To reclaim our lives
Because only steel can set us free

Rise my brothers, we are blessed by steel
In my sword I trust!
Arm yourselves, the truth shall be revealed
In my sword I trust!
Tyrants and cowards for metal you will kneel
In my sword I trust
'Til justice and reason will wield
In my sword I trust

The sword that shimmers in my hand,
Do you have the mind to eat the guilty flesh?
To drink the blood of those who are to blame?
The time of change is here, unveil your blade!

Rise my brothers we are blessed by steel
In my sword I trust
Arm yourselves the truth shall be revealed
In my sword I trust
Tyrants and cowards for metal you will kneel
In my sword I trust
'Til justice and reason will wield
In my sword I trust

Cling your souls to your gods
Kneel, obey, follow their laws
Deceit, subjugate, cherish their greed
Disdain verity, glorify futile faith

O Old Man,
Bring me a fiery fur coat
Put on me a blazing shirt
Shielded by which I may make war
Lest my head should come to grief
And my locks should go to waste
In the sport of bright iron
Upon the point of harsh steel
[Kalevala]

Rise my brothers we are blessed by steel
In my sword I trust
Arm yourselves the truth shall be revealed
In my sword I trust
Tyrants and cowards for metal you will kneel
In my sword I trust
'Til justice and reason will wield
In my sword I trust
In my sword I trust

3. Unsung Heroes
Forgotten tomb hill
Unnamed graves
No light can reach there
Memories fade away

Only frozen soil
And eternal wind
Remember the sacrifice
Of those who are now buried in time

A Dauntless heart
A Righteous mind
No sign of fear
Cast aside
Left to die
Just one frozen tear

Unsung heroes
Forgotten valour
Unknown soldiers
Entombed in time

Only shadows grow
Where the forsaken lie
Hope buried in snow

A thousand scars
Regret none
But only the dead ones
Have seen the end of war

4. Burning Leaves
Passing aeons
Everlasting fight against the Evil
Their army grows on and on
With the darkening horizon

I'm not afraid, let them come
I will never retreat
I will stand and hold my ground
Protect the ancient tree
The defense is doomed to fall
With the world I used to know

Burning leaves
Turn to ash before my eyes,
Crushed my dreams long gone.

Burning leaves
Dead branches reach to the sky,
The flame within me is gone.

On the light of the last dying star
Serpents crawl closer
All five branches, cursed from the start
And roots are torn to pieces
Right before my dying breath
I lay my eyes to the sky
As an eagle spreads its wings for the last time
Leaving me, the oak, the grove, to die

Burning leaves
Turn to ash before my eyes,
Crushed my dreams long gone.

Burning leaves
Dead branches reach to the sky,
The flame within me is gone.

Liekö enää päällä maan
Ainuttakaan joka muistaa
Lehdon tuon kauniin kaukaisen
Jonne tie vie jokainen
Kun kuolemaan vartija viimeinen
Keskellä liekkien ikuinen
Puu ja maailma ihmisten
Niin loppuu aikamme
[English translation:]
I wonder if any longer someone walks the Earth who recalls
That fair Grove afar, where all paths meet
As the last of the guardians falls, ablaze the
Eternal Tree and Domain of Man
Thus ends Our Time

5. Celestial Bond
A long time ago I went to the shore
I whispered my wish to a breeze from the North
The wind took the wish high to the stars
Told them what I've missed with all my heart

I was mesmerized by the rolling tide
I lay on that shore and gazed into the skies
Like a shooting star, my dream was gone
I made up my mind
I don't want to wake up

When will time heal and fulfil the dream of my heart?
When will we unite as one and light our own star?

All these memories I will treasure in my heart
Words are so vain
A bond beyond quintessence

For a thousand lifetimes
I will wait to feel
A passing moment of bliss
To be embraced by silence

6. Retribution Shall Be Mine
No sun rises today
No moon shares it's light
Eclipse of soul
Growing breach of faith

Pierced by bitter deception
Chained to the darkness
Left to rot
Growing breach of faith
Left to rot with hate

I can't escape from this living hell
But in my dreams the justice dwells
Betrayers are torn apart
And my hate will fade away with their blood

My hate runs deep
In the waters of grudge and unforgiveness

Leniency is for the weak
I'd rather die than show you mercy
Slaughter is yet to come

Retribution shall be mine!
Oh Gods of vengeance, fill my heart!

This is mine
The one and final fight
I choose not to die
With these demons by my side

7. Star Queen (Celestial Bond Part II)
The traveller's heart is meant to be free
No obligations and soul redeemed
I knew that part wasn't for me
When I met my star queen

Born in stars, like all of us
But can two paths start from one?
Unite again somewhere in time
And light the brightest star in the endless sky

Oh Queen of Stars
How long until
Oh Queen of Stars
Dreams are fulfilled?

Years go by I thought I could forget
I lived in a lie, that's all I regret
It's better for a man to die by the sword
Than wither away with undying love

I wish that the wind will play with her hair
Touch her lips, tell I'll be there
Longing for the moment for eternity
Light of a thousand stars will always comfort me

8. Pohjola
Luonto ponteva Pohjanmaan!
Milloin taas hänen nähdä saan?
Milloin saanenkaan kesä-yöllä
Nähdä kirkkaalla sädevyöllä
Ympäröityä taivoaan?
Milloin laineilta Pohjan vetten
Nähdä hohtehen, nähdä ett'en
Lansna unta ma nähnyt vaan? –
Milloin Pohjolan nähdä saan?

Onhan nytkin sen tunturit
Jylhät, korkeat, kaunihit;
Vielä kaiketi kosket kuohuu;
Totta vieläkin virrat vuoltuu
Syvin uurtehin halki maan?
Eikö merikin yhä vielä
Huhdo rannikkoamme siellä?
Myrskyn virtt' eikö kuulukkaan? –

Milloin, milloin sen nähdä saan?
Talvismaailman mahti uus',
Lumitannerten ihannus,
Mustat metsät ja synkät salot,
Revontulien tummat palot,
Nekin luontoa Phojanmaan.
Eikö kaikk' ole kannallansa?
Tokko mainio Pohjan kansa
Viel' on vanhassa viomassaan? –
Milloin Pohjolan nähdä saan?

Kansa vankka, mi muinaisin
Seisoi miehuuden mittehin,
Vaarat hiihteli, kynti merta,
Tokko nytkin on vanhallaan?
Tooko voinee se sodan tiellä
Altiiks henkensä antaa vielä
Estä armahan isänmaan? –
Milloin, milloin sen nähdä saan?
[Yrjö Koskinen 1830 - 1903]

Pohjola, minun maa
Pohjaton, kaipuuni
Pohjannaula, mua johdata

9. Last Breath
Lying on the ground
As battle rages on
Warm blood covers
The cold land of our fathers

Don't cry for me my son
Because I'm not the only one
Where I go you can't follow
This journey I will make all alone

I've bled so many times for this land
But this wound will claim my life
Death commands me to give my hand

Let not my people
Live under oppression
And remember the darker the night
The more beautiful is the morning's light

Fear no more
Just let go
Adore this world
Once more
The truth unfolds
In the Ancient Halls
Fear no more
Just let go

There is no shimmer of the light
In this pouring rain
I close my eyes
Has it all been in vain?

10. Passion, Proof, Power
Where to find the truth?
Questions linger through time
Unbreakable will and inquiring mind
Have always been the seeker's guide

The Reason as my sword
The Knowledge as my shield
I'll face my foes again and again
On the ancient battlefield

I can't deny what I've seen
So towards the great unknown
I must keep going on

Stop your quest
Or with fire you'll be cleansed
Confess...
Death...

Woe to the faith
Through dark centuries
The wait for the time
When all is revealed

Unbreakable
Stands through time
Dwells the proof of life
Eternal Earth of mine

Cleanse our souls
No good thoughts shall burn
Engulf the passion of life
Eternal Fire of mine

Carry it on
The ancient wisdom of mankind
Eternal Air of mine

Renew us within
Wash away
The remains of lies
Eternal Water of mine

Indivisible
Beyond death and life
The answer divine
Eternal Elements of mine

The gatekeeper of the knowledge
The One who was trusted the secrets of time and space once said:
To know is your destination
To find is your possibility
And to search is your quest.

Your path has merged with the truth.
But yet you refuse to see it
It's easier to be afraid, to be deceived, to be a sheep
Be aware, question them, question yourself
Because once you see it, you can never look away

Every man's
Horizon can change
But eternal skies
Will always stay the same

Like a new sun arises from winter's cold and dark grave, it's unstoppable.

Keep your twisted beliefs
Sons and Daughters of Dawn are calling me

The fire that burns my flesh
Shall light up the words I've said
The curse on my innocent name
Shall put all of you in shame

Woe to the man
Who disheartens the few
Who reach for the light
Who searches for the truth

I only have just one more wish
That this torch will be passed onto someone sentient like you
When your time comes, don't lose your heart
Have faith and patience and trust in the flame before passing it onto someone new

The greatest power of all
Will force their gods to fall
The greatest power of all
Embrace, illuminate all!

I am, you are, no one's slave
No man or god they have made

11. Bamboleo
[Limited Edition Bonus Track][originally by Gipsy King]Este amor llega asi esta manera
No tiene la culpa
Caballo le ven sabana
Porque muy depreciado,
Por eso no te perdon de llorar
Este amor llega asi esta manera
No tiene la culpa,
Amor de comprementa
Amor del mes pasado
Bebele, bembele, bembele

Bamboleo, bambolea
Porque mi vida, yo la prefiero vivir asi
Bamboleo, bambolea
Porque mi vida, yo la prefiero vivir asi
No tiene pardon de dios
Tu eres mi vida, la fortuna del destino
Pero el destino tendressa para dos
Lo mismo yo que ayer
Lo mismo soy yo
No te encuentro a l'abandon
Es imposible no te encuentro de verdad
Por eso un dia no cuentro si de nada
Lo mismo you que ayer
Yo pienso en ti

Bamboleo, bambolea
Porque mi vida, yo la prefiero vivir asi
Bamboleo, bambolea
Porque mi vida, yo la prefiero vivir asi

ENSIFERUM LYRICS


1. Ad Victoriam
[Instrumental]

2. Blood Is The Price Of Glory
Before the grimmest enemy
Cold rain whipping those proud faces
Warcries raising their spirits
Despising death as they rush forward
Blood of the brothers drains to the ground
Stirring up rage, giving the power
Trampling the enemy with their feet
Without fear they fight

Can you hear the call of the North star
Feel its longing in your heart
This bound is eternal
Sworn through blood
At the end we will stand as one!
Even if the daylight dies
Our horde marches on and on
If we should fall down to the ground
We'll rise again and never give up!

But for some it's all too much
This honorable battle and bloodshed
They flee like a swarm of craven rats
Leaving their brothers to a certain death
The last furious men
They didn't fear death or pain
They held up their swords and shields
As winners they stood on the battlefield

Can you hear the call of the North star
Feel its longing in your heart
This bound is eternal
Sworn through blood
At the end we will stand as one!
Even if the daylight dies
Our horde marches on and on
If we should fall down to the ground
We'll rise again and never give up!

Run away you cowards
We turn our backs on you
The shame that now stains your name
Will only brighten our glory
Those who fight till their last breath
And fall with honour
Their names and deeds shall live forever
Never to be forgotten

No axe stayed in your weak hand
No shield protected you from the blows of enemies
Get out of our sight
The war has no need for traitors

Can you hear the call of the North star
Feel its longing in your heart
This bound is eternal
Sworn through blood
At the end we will stand as one!
Even if the daylight dies
Our horde marches on and on
If we should fall down to the ground
We'll rise again and never give up!

3. Deathbringer From The Sky
High above the ground
Beyond the thunderclouds
A Black shade is flying alone
Once so feared among men
Now the legend is becoming too old
But finally the horrifying truth is about to unfold

Deathbringer from the Sky
Hunting victims in the night
Feel the terror as flames are burning bright
There is... No tower as high or a cave so deep
That can save you from its endless spite
So bow down and face your wretched destiny

A Den filled with treasures and gold
No longer calms his spirit so cold
Again it is time to spread the wings of doom
A Growl shakes the ground
Flames blind men and smoke covers the stars
As he rises towards an ancient sky

The era of total chaos will arrive
Men shall flee in fear
My name will haunt their mortal souls
I'll burn their flesh and I'll crush their bones

Now they shall know
That every myth told is true
They shall burn on my blazing gallows

Deathbringer from the Sky
Hunting victims in the night
Feel the terror as flames are burning bright
There is... No tower as high or a cave so deep
That can save you from its endless spite
So bow down and face your wretched destiny

Your screams can't make me feel pity or regret
I only feel furious hatred
With fire my dominion is gained
So burn away and let my kind rule the world again

4. Ahti
At the time of sundown
Nature bathes in colours
In silence it waits
For the approaching force
In the halls of Ainola
The true king of dark waters
Lurks with his mistress
And a mob of a sea creatures

Under the waves of a blue lake
Dwells the mighty AHTI!
Sailors praise the glorious name
Of the ruler of tides; AHTI!

At the shores of a northern land
Pray mortal men
Destruction for the arrogant fools
A Reward for humble souls
The great lurker of the seas
Is pleased of the sacrifice
The waters are calm
Today no storm shall rise!

Under the waves of a blue lake
Dwells the mighty AHTI!
Sailors praise the glorious name
Of the ruler of tides; AHTI!

Under the waves of a blue lake
Dwells the mighty AHTI!
Sailors praise the glorious name
Of the ruler of tides; AHTI!

Foreign ship filled with infidels
They didn't listen to the northern men
From a dead calm storm will rise
And they'll face the wrath of the sea
Take care that your heir
Don't turn out too proud
Or your bloodline will drown
Into a vast ocean...

Under the waves of a blue lake
Dwells the mighty AHTI!
Sailors praise the glorious name
Of the ruler of tides; AHTI!

Under the waves of a blue lake
Dwells the mighty AHTI!
Sailors praise the glorious name
Of the ruler of tides; AHTI!

5. One More Magic Potion
Once when we were returning from a battle and
We got lost in a gloomy forest
in the middle of the woods
we saw an old house
with tired minds we knocked
the door very loudly
Old woman opened the wooden door
She asked us to come in
with kind words
From her pot arose a scent so weird
Stunning and bitter but very summoning

Bring me a magic potion
it will heal my aching wounds
A taste so bitter that makes
my bleeding soul feel so good
It will make us sing and dance
in our endless feast
Or it might even unleash
the beast in me

She filled out pints with that devils beverage
And served another round with an hideous grin
The world was spinning in a new light I saw everything
and everyone was singing this song

With nature, trolls and the spirits of the forest
We are one; let our singing rise up into the stars
The witch's magic drum was still beating hard
When a goblin brought me a new pint and together we roared

Drink and dance!
People of the forest sing with us!
Who wants to brawl with me?
Who can shape a kantele from a pike's jaw?
Like the great one once did

Close your eyes
Calm your mind and drift away from the pain
Beyond dreams
Into the depths of the cauldron
Like a rain it falls
And mirrors nature's healing powers
Surrender this time
And relief you shall find

Catcher of souls
hunter of spirits
Grant us the final frop of the life's elixir
I want to drown all my misery
Into the green trolls blood
And brown swamp drink
Fight against diminishing time
Burden of a solitary warrior's life
Catcher of souls
hunter of spirits
Grant us the final frop of the life's elixir

Bring me a magic potion
it will heal my aching wounds
A taste so bitter that makes
my bleeding soul feel so good
It will make us sing and dance
in our endless feast
Or it might even unleash
the beast in me

6. Wanderer
In time bleeding wounds will heal
Unlike some which are too deep to see
Like scars in a nomads soul
Their mending is so slow
Not the shout of a hundred enemies
Can make him feel fear inside him
But when sun sets and the cold arrives
With crushing solitude in the darkness of night

He will ride across land and time
To find a way through this endless night
There's a storm in his heart and the fire burns his soul
But the wanderer's part is to ride alone

With bare hands he has taken many lives
He has had a hundred women by his side
From enchanted woods to the freezing north
He is known at every sea and far beyond
As the moon grows and the circle is complete
He lies down and waits for sleep
But there's always a scenery in his mind
Of all that beauty he once left behind

He will ride across land and time
To find a way through this endless night
There's a storm in his heart and the fire burns his soul
But the wanderer's part is to ride alone

He will ride across land and time
To find a way through this endless night
There's a storm in his heart and the fire burns his soul
But the wanderer's part is to ride alone

He will ride across land and time
To find a way through this endless night
There's a storm in his heart and the fire burns his soul
But the wanderer's part is to ride alone

7. Raised By The Swords
Oh, who is raised by the sword
Can't be beaten
Who is toughened by the fire
Can't be burned
Awaited by immortality
Are the ones sacrificing their lives
To blood, to victory, to the truth

As ye saw, as shall ye reap
We will turn your fields into death
Shining our blades smash all down
Guidance of cold winds
We complete the ancient rule
Each of us was created to kill

Hail, the wisest ones
You have walked the severe and harsh path
To the almighty crown
Soon the lost riddles will be solved
Once and for all
As the ageless earth praises your sword

As ye saw, as shall ye reap
We will turn your fields into death
Shining our blades smash all down
Guidance of cold winds
We complete the ancient rule
Each of us was created to kill

Oh, raise the wind
Oh, open up earth
Oh, wild waters flood
And flames burn the ruins they own
Burn all and everything they own

Now let your prayers fade
The weak ones will meet their gruesome fate
Loyal minds will not break
The bold people of war
Have raised to get their victory
You depend on our mercy
Who is raised by the sword
Can't be beaten
Who is toughened by the fire
Can't be burned
Our everlasting loyalty will never break
The bold people of war
Have raised their swords

8. The New Dawn
Through the storm like the wind we ride
Leaving it all far behind
Another war is straight ahead
This fight will give us all
None shall live , they all will fall
When the new dawn arises, we stand tall

Fight! For our new dawn
Ride! Kill them all
Fight! For our new dawn
Rise! And we stand tall

Feel your strength and let it rise
Hear the call of their demise
Let them feel your steel
Have faith my friend, this is not the end
Our time is near, we feel your fear
Because we will...

Fight! For our new dawn
Ride! Kill them all
Fight! For our new dawn
Rise! And we stand tall

Nothing can stop us now
As we march towards the final fight
It waits us in the night
Our swords are taking lives
Giving us what is ours
Now the new dawn arises and we have it all

Fight! For our new dawn
Ride! Kill them all
Fight! For our new dawn
Rise! And we stand tall

9. Victory Song
The plan of invasion
an Evil deception
Was made in the halls of the dark kingdom
To steal their riches
To slave them all
To make them kneel for a new God

The Guard woke up the sleeping men
With the sound of a bronze horn
The enemy is getting closer
So brace yourselves for assault!

Swords in their hands they killed each and every man
Who dared to invade their sacred land
Victory songs are raising in the night
Telling all of their undying strength and might

Arrows are raining from the sky
As brothers fight side by side
We're outnumbered
But our destiny is to win

FIGHT!
Fight with the rage of a bear!
DEFEND!
Our homeland!
CRUSH!
Crush every enemy!
AND SEAL!
Our victory!

Swords in their hands they killed each and every man
Who dared to invade their sacred land
Victory songs are raising in the night
Telling all of their undying strength and might

Ei urhot kaukaisen Pohjolan
Uhan eessä taipuneet
Jälleen pauhaa kansi taivahan
Veri valuu maahan lumiseen
Moni nähdä ei saa enää huomista
Moni jää heitä kaipaamaan
Jälkipolville jää maa rauhaisa
Voiton laulut soi ainiaan
Voiton laulut soi ainiaan!

[English translation:]

The braves of the north
Didn't give in before the threat
Again the sky dome rumbles
Blood stains the snow
Many don't get to see tomorrow
Many will be missed
Land remains peaceful for progeny
Songs of victory will sound forever)

Swords in their hands they killed each and every man
Who dared to invade their sacred land
Victory songs are raising in the night
Telling all of their undying strength and might

Swords in their hands they killed each and every man
Who dared to invade their sacred land
Victory songs are raising in the night
Telling all of their undying strength and might

10. Lady In Black
[originally by Uriah Heep]She came to me one morning
One lonely Sunday morning
Her long hair flowing
In the midwinter wind
I know not how she found me
For in darkness I was walking
And destruction lay around me
From a fight I could not win
Ah ah ah...

She asked me name my foe then
I said the need within some men
To fight and kill their brothers
Without thought of love or God
And I begged her give me horses
To trample down my enemy
So eager was my passion
To devour this waste of life
Ah ah ah...

But she wouldn't think of battle that
Reduces men to animals
So easy to begin
And yet impossible to end
For she's the mother of all men
Had counselled me so wisely then
I feared to walk alone again
And asked if she would stay
Ah ah ah...

Oh lady lend your hand I cried
And let me rest here at your side
Have faith and trust
In me she said
And filled my heart with life
There is no strength in numbers
Have no such misconception
But when you need me
Be assured I won't be far away
Ah ah ah...

Thus having spoke she turned away
And though I found no words to say
I stood and watched until I saw
Her black cloak disappear
My labor is no easier
But now I know I'm not alone
I find new heart each time
I think upon that windy day
And if one day she comes to you
Drink deeply from her words so wise
Take courage from her
As your prize
And say hello from me
Ah ah ah...

ENSIFERUM LYRICS


1. Dragonheads
Sails up! We're leaving today
Distant lands are calling
Cowards stay at home; this is a quest of true men
Farewell, should we never see again

Weeping women waving at the pier
When the sky starts to cry
But neither rain, nor wind can make us turn around
What's decided, has to be done

See how the forefathers greet, us with northern lights
Bravely towards unknown shores, through raging storms we fight
Faith in the gods, their strength in our hearts, when lightning strikes
If we die, we'll meet again in Valhalla...

In a dream I saw two ravens in the sky
And a verdant land behind
When we set out feet there, we'll burn our fleet
'Cause the land is promised to us by gods

May Njord protect us on our way
May the moon light our path
Let our spirits be purified by the ocean's breeze
Let the wind, tell our legend which ever lasts

When we reach the open sea, leaving our home behind
The Dragonheads are rising, let the stars be our guides

See how the forefathers greet, us with northern lights
Bravely towards unknown shores, through raging storms we fight
Faith in the gods, their strength in our hearts, when lightning strikes
If we die the sun will shine again beyond mortal time
We'll meet again in Valhalla!

2. Warrior's Quest
Strike with powers of magic stone
Grab your legacy that you behold
If you can find your destiny
Then you may return back to your home

...Ride away with your mighty horse
Ride away through the land of storms...
Unknown are the ways of your journey ahead
But with strength and courage you can avoid your death

Throw your sword through the memories
Embracing your bleeding heart
Don't follow the shadows they ain't for real
Like the guiding stars

As he falls to eternity the truth is fading
Part of him died long time ago but still there's death awaiting

Go now brave warrior don't look back
The stars will guide you through the night
But even the brightest light,
Won't reach into the darkest night...

3. Kalevala Melody
[Instrumental]

4. White Storm
On this magical dawn the colours of the autumn are reflected by a light
A light that has been captured for years in oblivion of time

Circles of time are raging now
And so his powers are slowly dying
Before the coldness rapes the lands
His spirit is wandering into the night... to die!

...And he heard chimes ahead playing these enchanted notes,
That lead him into a wooden cabin, where he could rest for the night...

Over the mountains
He had traveled
Across the oceans
Deep in the night
Now when it's time to
Say last farewells
Show us your power
Show us your might

His eyes can see it so clearly now
But his restless mind cannot sense it in the air
The white storm is close!

...And his powers gained in this mystical place more than he ever possessed before.
So now he could rule the realms of ice... Once again!

Over the mountains
He had traveled
Across the oceans
Deep in the night
Now when it's time to
Say last farewells
Show us your power
Gift from the sky

5. Into Hiding
[Amorphis cover]

The islander slips into hiding
And takes to his heels
Out of dark Northland
The murky house of Sara
He whirled out of doors as snow
Arrives as smoke in the yard
To flee from bad deeds

There he had to become someone else
He must change his shape
As an eagle he swept up
Wanted to soar heavenward
The sun burnt his cheeks
The moon lit his brows

6. Finnish Medley
Jo Karjalan kunnailla lehtii puu,
jo Karjalan koivikot tuuhettuu.
Käki kukkuu siellä ja kevät on,
vie sinne mun kaihoni pohjaton.

Ma tunnen vaaras' ja vuoristovyös'
ja kaskies' sauhut ja uinuvat yös'
ja synkkäin metsies' aarniopuut
ja siintävät salmes' ja vuonojen suut.

Siell' usein matkani määrätöin
läpi metsien kulki ja näreikköin,
Minä seisoin vaaroilla paljain päin,
missä Karjalan kauniin eessäin näin.

Terve, metsä, terve, vuori,
terve, metsän ruhtinas!
Täs on poikas uljas, nuori;
esiin käy hän, voimaa täys,
kuin tuima tunturin tuuli.

Metsän poika tahdon olla,
sankar jylhän kuusiston,
Tapiolan vainiolla
karhun kanssa painii lyön
ja maailma Unholaan jääköön.

Ihana on täällä rauha,
urhea on taistelo:
myrsky käy ja metsä pauhaa,
tulta iskee pitkäinen
ja kuusi ryskyen kaatuu.

[English translation:]

The tree is blooming on the fields of Karelia
The Karelian birches are getting thicker
Your cockoo is cockooing and it is spring
Take my endless yearning there.

I feel your danger and your' mountain range.
and the smoke of your burnt land and your sleeping nights
and the primeval trees of your forest
and your looming inlets and the mounths of the fjords.

My journey is oft there without a goal
through forests went, bushes
I stood with a bare head on the hills
where I saw the beautiful Karelia ahead of me

Hello, forest, hello, mountain
Hello, the prince of the forest
Here is a noble boy, young
He comes forward, full of power
as the severe wind of the field

I want to be a son of the forest
hero of the gloomy spruce copse
on the fields of Tapiola
I wrestle with the bear
And the world shall be forgotten

The peace is here wonderful
Brave is the fighting
Storm is coming and forest thunders
The fire strikes long
and a spruce falls down loudly

ENSIFERUM LYRICS


1. March Of War
[Instrumental]
2. Axe Of Judgment
Patience is a virtue when you live for revenge
Hide your weapons, veil your hate, seek your foes unguarded and slay them!

Slay them!
Behead them!
Oh sweet revenge!
Behold, the axe of judgement falls!
This is war!
So make them suffer!

I share no thought for the dark depths where fate made me dwell
My hate has shaped me to perfection
A ruthless executioner

Remember this hate
Was the only thought in my head
When I woke up wounded on the ground
Stabbed in the back
A coward's attack
Curse you!
This means war!

If I would believe in soul
I would slaughter yours
But fear and agony in your eyes
Will have to do

When the axe of judgement falls
The vindictive one stands tall

3. Heathen Horde
Too many times has moon travelled across the sky,
Since our fathers sailed out for glory and honour,
It's time to fulfill the vow once given,
Forge your plows to swords, send the word,
Raise an army countless as stars in the sky.

[Chorus:]
All heathen hearts,
Answer the call,
God of thunder bless our swords,
Our heathen horde,
Will never fall,
We are hungry for blood, steel and war.

Filled with strength, valour, determination,
Determined to conquer the land,
There is no power,
In their weak invocation,
Puny invocations to their feeble god,
Desecrate and drown it in their blood.

[Chorus]

Ósnjallr maðr
hyggsk munu ey lifa
ef hann við víg varask
en elli gefr
honum engi frið
þótt honum geirar gefi

[English translation of Old Norse poem:
"A coward believes he will ever live
If he keep him safe from strife:
But old age leaves him not long in peace
Though spears may spare his life."]

Row!
Storm is getting near,
Row!
I can see land ahead,
No!
Show no mercy for the weak,
Gold, land and women are ours to take so kill!

[Chorus]

4. One Man Army
This lifeless soil
Barren of good thoughts
Scorched by grudge and grief
Doomed to linger on
Wandered aimlessly
Blinded by their lies
Now I raise my head and sword
When shadows steal the light

Fire
Desire
Denial
Burning
Yearning
Discerning

Fire
Desire
Denial
In my heart
Burning
Yearning
Discerning
I see it now

You call it cruelty
I call it strength
I am cursed to be
A one man army
You call me inhumane
I call this life regained
I am blessed to be
A one man army

I will take the lives, lives of my enemies
Yet still this battle feels like a defeat to me
Death or victory, only emptiness I feel
The spring of hope runs dry
Because I'm already dead inside

[Solo]

I will take the lives, lives of my enemies
Yet still this battle feels like a defeat to me

Death or victory

Fire
Desire
Denial
Burning
Yearning
Discerning

Fire
Desire
Denial
In my heart
Burning
Yearning
Discerning
I see it now

You call it cruelty
I call it strength
I am cursed to be
A one man army
You call me inhumane
I call this life regained
I am blessed to be
A one man army

One man army

5. Burden Of The Fallen
Nightmares return again.
There's no way to make amends.
His heart and the battlefield
Are alike, silent and empty.

6. Warrior Without A War
Only change is unavoidable,
A brave new chapter is getting closer [again],
Without a shroud of doubt he walked
The road so long. One dream, now gone.

What are you more afraid to find:
Something to live or something to die for?
In the end, how will you fall:
As a hero or a warrior without a war?

Why you withhold the pain but need those scars?
How will you leave to the unknown shores?
As a hero or a warrior without a war?
As a hero or a warrior without a war?

The one who is now forgotten
Carries the weight of a mountain.
No one can see how solemn
Is the burden of the fallen.

Memories, ruthless like old guilt.
Choices, accept or be haunted [since die].
No past, no future means a thing.
The very moment is all there is.

What are you more afraid to find:
Something to live or something to die for?
In the end, how will you fall:
As a hero or a warrior without a war?
As a hero or a warrior without a war?

Is it courage to let go or drown with a sword?
How will you face your final dawn?
As a hero or a warrior without a war?

The one who is now forgotten
Carries the weight of a mountain.
No one can see how solemn
Is the burden of the fallen.

7. Cry For The Earth Bounds
The cry for the earth bounds
Who'll face the final sundown

On the last shore of this dying world
A man, a symbol, a sword
A vague memory of something that was
But the moment takes its grasp

Horizon so calm
Harbinger of doom
Sets the sky ablaze
Torn apart by the whirl of time
Slowly, grimly all is devoured by night

Through the night we ride
Till the edge of time
Comforting death
Under the crumbling sky

Your fights
Are over now
Lay down and sleep
Gone are
All hate and love
For eternity

No eyes to see
When the last light that dwindles
Fades to nothingness
No souls to save
In the endless darkness
No hope, no forgiveness

8. Two Of Spades
I go all the way
Night and day
Women, booze and money
It's all just a game

Hit and run
That's how I play
All or nothing
That's the winner's way

When I woke up this morning
Everything was clear
Besides my head
Who's the lady in my bed?

I'll shoot the moon
Nice girls won't tell
Thanks for nothing
I'll be on my way to hell

Sweet lady luck on my side
I got ace in the sleeve
Dead man's hand
I'm armed to my teeth

There is no trick in the book
That I wouldn't know
Cross me and feel
The embrace of the rope

I'm a high roller
Gambling my life every single day
I'm not a poser
Because the card of my life is two of spades

Jos käy niin, että tänään kuolen,
esi-isien luo, ajan tuolle puolen
edessäin seisovat Valhallan portit
kädessäin hyvin pelatut elämän kortit

[English translation of the Finnish part:
"If I may die today,
To my ancestors, beyond time
In front of me stands the gates of Valhalla
In my hand well played cards of life."]

9. My Ancestors' Blood (Heathen Throne Part III)
Not just for victory,
Not just to crush your enemy,
Not just for heir to be,
But for this moment and to fight the injustice...

It was written long ago,
This is what I've been told,
An army came across the sea
To conquer this low land.

They lured with their lies,
Shouted, "Peasant, kneel or die!"
Outnumbered, undaunted,
War cry rose to the skies.

On the homeland of the raven,
Where the eagles scream at daybreak,
And the clang and clash of armies,
Beautiful the strife for conquest.

[Chorus:]
Rains came over to the north,
Flood of lies to drown the old gods,
A storm rose within the hearts of the enslaved,
Ode for my ancestors' blood.

The seer foresaw the curse from above,
Like a roar of approaching giant horde,
In the moors and in the marshes,
On the borders of the woodlands,
They marched like approaching giant horde.

When I yield my life forever,
Bravely will I fall in battle,
Fall upon the field of glory,
Beautiful to die in armour.

[Chorus]

10. Descendants, Defiance, Domination
The darkest hour, the hopeless time
Is always before the rise of the dawn
Find your courage to stand against a stream
The fairest they speak when the falsest they think

When mouths of men speak the words of gods
The truth will never be enough for anyone
When you reach the peak of the highest mountain
Proudly plant the flag of the heathen defiance

From the ashes of the ancient blood and wisdom
The children of thunder will rise again

Wielded lashes, pyres aflame, gloomy gallows
Tormented ones, brave and free
Screams echo in time

Not one unjust deed goes unpunished
No blood is shed in vain under the reborn thunder sign

I know we will
Claim the throne and kill
They asked for war so we will give them one

The one to end it all
Reckoning with blood
Stop the madness that's gone on for centuries

In a storm of obloquy, my sons stand strong
Marshall the forces, gather up weapons for the last war to come

Who is so righteous, uncorrupted to condemn and dominate
With truth and not with illusions
Not driven by the greed to be enthroned and rule?
Havoc no more
The reign of man

11. Neito Pohjolan
Nähnyt oon sen, yllä aaltojen kaukaisten
Kuinka loistaa kuu ja tähdet taivaiden

Kai kulkuri matkoillaan voi joskus unhoittaa
Kuinka kotimaa oottaa kaukaa plaavaa...

Kaihon siivin saan
Lentää halki kaukomaan
Minne sydän halajaa
Aina palaamaan

Eessä myrskytuulien
Eessä elon taistojen
Aina sydämessäin oon
Neito pohjolan

Kun lähdin pois
Virranneet ei surun kyyneleet
Kun palaan takaisin
Huomaan jonkin muuttuneen

Ei polku tuo kulkurin
Totta ollutkaan
Vaan ainoastaan
Kaipausta ja unelmaa

[English translation:]

[Lady Of The North]

I have seen
How moon and stars glimmer
Over the waves far away

Sometimes wanderer may forget
How home land keeps on waiting
The one who is returning from far away

With the wings of longing
I fly across a distant land
To where my heart always desires to return

In front of storm clouds
In front of battles of life
In my heart I'll always be
Lady of the North

When I left
Tears of sorrow didn't flow
When I came back
I saw that something had changed

The path of a drifter
Wasn't real
But only longing and dreams

12. Candour And Lies
I, I have sailed
All alone
So many times
The seven seas of tears
I can still hear the waves.

Cold frigid wind
On my sails
Always takes me back
To distant memories
Home, the last farewell.

Waves of time
Candour and lies
for what I left behind,
I know the price was high.

No tears to cry
No words to make it right
But now I know that home is
Where my heart desires.

I, I was lost
No star
No shore to call my own
But I didn't know
I had it all.

On the fields of victories
And defeats
A drifter's life is both
longing and dreams
then reality.

Wasted time,
Candour and lies,
For what I left behind,
I know the price was high.
[x2]

No tears to cry,
No words to make it right,
But now I know that home is
Where my heart desires.

13. Bonus Song
Hear the thunder drums
Blasting in the night
Feel the guitar solo getting near
Bass is so punchy
And that's the way I like it
Vocals are fantastic
And Finnish is the language

With the lyrics whatever fits
Thunder tits!

This is what you get,
When you ask more and more.
Kiki diki bang bang all night long
We'll kick you in the balls!
Like the legend says
"Töttöröö, King Kong"
Über heavy Viking metal!
There's no sense at all!

In the lyrics whatever fits
Thunder tits!

Magic, swords, and dragons!
That's all that matters!
We wrote this song
To please you all
No cover songs to play
No wise words to say
So sing along it's a Bonus song!

[Solo]

Ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Petri Lindroos

Whoa
Whoa oh
[Repeat]
Vittu everybody!

Whoa
Whoa oh
[Repeat]

With the lyrics whatever fits
Fuck this shit!

Magic, swords, and dragons!
That's all that matters!
We wrote this song
To please you all,
No cover songs to play
No wise words to say
So sing along it's a Bonus song!

Shout once more!
It's a Bonus song!
It's a Bonus song!
It's a Bonus song!
Bonus song!

Booonuuus sooong!

ENSIFERUM LYRICS


1. Ajattomasta Unesta
Katsokaa tuulen kulkua
Kuulkaa ajan kuoksua
Alla ikitähtitaivahan
Kasvava on voima valtava
Pohjanpalon loimussa
Nousee miekka voittajan

Behold how travels the wind
Hear how runs the time
Beneath the eternal star dotted sky
Will grow a vast power
In the glow of northern lights
Rises the sword of the victor

2. For Those About To Fight For Metal
Outnumbered but never alone, we stand
Brave warriors, axes in our hands
The symbol of enlightenment
The secret of steel
Carved in the hearts of the free

Forged in eternal fire
Harden in the frozen rain
There is something stronger than mortal flesh
That unites us as one

For those about to fight for metal;
Gods of war salute you all
For those who'll never lower their blade;
We're blood brothers 'til the end

The sound of archaic battle horns
Releases the beast within us all
Join us to fight for the metal dawn
Or one by one, you will fall

Let me hear your battle cry!
Raise your swords up high!

3. Way Of The Warrior
Staring into dying flames
Moon as my only guard
It's too late to hesitate
Only the weak suffer in this life

It's the way of the warrior
This path before me
Destined to be the king
Of battlefields

It's the eve of the bloodshed:
Women and mead!
From the skulls of my foes
Tomorrow, I'll drink

I shall honour my blade
With deeds, not with hollow words
Men will kneel when they hear my name
Before I laugh and rip out their wretched hearts

[Kalevala 26:]
Siell on miehet miekka vyöllä
Urohot sota-aseissa
Humalassa hullut miehet
Pahat paaljo juotuansa

There are warriors with broadswords
Heroes clad in mail of copper
Are on beer intoxicated
By the beer are much embittered

4. Two Paths
Callow dreams
Dawn of spring
No seeds of doubt yet sown in the ground
Man-made shades mould reality
Looming deceptions
Hope blurs it all

The path so bright
The path so dark
All crossroads
Illusions of our lives

No, feel no pity for a dying man
We're all just here to die, to live one precious life
None for all and all for none
It's the only law
Feed you inner wolves
With prudence

When the night closes in
It grants us the final wish
The blade may be rusty and dull
But the spirit will never bend
Unforgiving, benevolent, brave, noble and foolish
All will dim with the last exhale
Then all will be complete

Every deed has a price to pay
May sagacity and chaos bless your way

5. King Of Storms
Who dares to stare death in the eye?
And face the maelstrom of doom like a hero?
When light splits the sky
And like a thousand giants, thunder roars

King of storms
Descends from the skies
Before my eyes
Destroyer of worlds
King of storms

I will rule with fear and pain
Your world will burn in dragon flame

You will
Obey
Your kin
Will yield when I say

Your dreams
Your fears
Your dying screams
Belong to me

Descry the beast of the nightmare realm
Destruction of all, humanity abhorred
Ravaged land where the afflicted dwell
The frozen void entombs idle prayers and exhorts

6. Feast With Valkyries
Through mist we ride
Howling wolves in moonlight
Blood has been shed tonight
It's judgement time

Gallantly you fought
Made your people proud
Rise brave warriors
The journey has just begun

High to the skies
Across the seas,
Woods of the north
And mountain peaks

The song will sound
Through history
Tonight we'll feast with Valkyries

Sons of frost and steel, reinvigorate
Stay humble not brash
Because I'm the one who chooses the slain

North wind in my hair
Only me, my steed and my spear
Charge to another battlefield
Eternal chant in the air

7. Don't You Say
From town to town I roam and dwell
Sing my songs and stories I tell
Gone is the gold and ladies' smile
I'm living on borrowed time

This is me, no guilt, no shame
I ain't no saint, I ain't no king
I'm a man of my word
With a stone backbone
Open your arms
I'm coming home

Don't you say it's the same old story
Don't you say I came too late
Don't you say it was all for nothing
For now I am here to stay
This promise will never fade away

I have a will, hard as a rock
But it crumbled down with the very last drop
Don't ask so I don't have to lie
I'm a rover 'til the day I die

8. I Will Never Kneel
Winds are calling me
The cold breeze of death
From the dividing stream
The clarity of what lies ahead

Your fortune will never change
Is what blind weaklings say
But I will not rest before the day
Every peasant is crowned as his own king

I will never kneel
Before your false beliefs
By my heathen blood
I will not give up

Minä rinnassa kannan sydänyön mustaa kipinää
Minä anteeksi annan ja unohdan, en ikinä
Tätä kaunaa, vainoa, kuollutta painoa, en ik inä
Minö anteeksi anna ja unohda
En ik inä

In my chest shines a glimmer as dark as the heart of the night
I will never forgive nor forget
The grudge, haunting, dead weight,
I will never forgive and forget… never

My love, where have you gone?
So cold, what have they done?
I can't see you, the world drowns in tears
I will forgive you, become the righteous hate and never forget
All is lost now, what once was a dream
Will never be seen
Spill their blood, revenge for both of us
And for all that will never be…

9. God Is Dead
Bring out your dead
I shout again
Will this ever end?
Rotting corpses everywhere
But I knew how to transcend

Round and round, the bottle goes
Drown, drown all hope and sorrow

Mad men on the streets
Keep herding their sheep
High or low, we're all gonna go
Down at least for six feet

Like thunder in a pint
Divine truth I will find
Lifelong misery
It is not out destiny

Joy to the world, god is dead
So let's drink until the bitter end

They whip you with their made-up sins
They beat you until you finally give in
But know that there is another path
Filled with joy and not the grandeur of misery
Wake up and see
Drink with me
In our wanton harmony

10. Hail To The Victor
Scareless man
Mangled soul of a solitary
Some fights
That are fought in the mind are not imaginary

Blazing eyes
Although the road has been long
All chains
Ignorance and hate…no more

Time is the dividend on ephemeral paths
Longing of the fulfillment is carved in wolven hearts
All those, in the end, will merge in to one

These times
These lives
In the hands of beasts of lies
Man made gods
Turning tides
Unknown future, no hope in sight

Foul beings
The ultimate sin
Like fools, they charge to kill their kin

The legend tells
In the hearts of men
Is the way, the power, to rise above this hell

Hail to the victor!
Once a castaway
But never astray
In the mirror we'll see the face
Of the only god whom should be praised

11. Unettomaan Aikaan
Vain aamu-usva peittona
Laulu säilyy muistona
On joka polun hintana
Kaiho, epäily ja kuolema

Only morning mist as a veil
The song will remain as a memory
The price of every path is longing, doubt and death

ENSIFERUM LYRICS


1. Slaget I Skogen Bortenfor (Epilog / Slaget)
Strokes from oars could be heard,
beautiful ships gushed through the sea
Like a wind from the north,
our ancestors reached the shore
Men from Hordaland, Rogaland and Adger
gathered for battle in common
Proud men with no fear
Strokes from the sword crushed the skull of the christian

A long time we ruled, kings of the north
Many battles we won, at the shores of Midgard
But, betrayed by our own brothers
we were forced down on our knees
Now when the wind once again is howling
the thoughts finally goes towards home
We shall rise in our glory
The white horde will for sure shiver

"We died like men
Therefore we never vanished
Weak is the one the enemy loves
Never betray your origin"

ENSLAVED LYRICS


1. Frost
[instrumental]

2. Loke
Laughter echoes through the night
The evening star shines over Midgard
Evil mingles in the dark
The organised cosmos' enemy comes forth

Loke, the son of Fårbaute.. father of lies
Born of earth, unbound by laws

Takk weeps no heavy tears
For the loss of the sun's handsome son
But the mare in the woods submits
For the regaining of Foster brother's favour

Loke, the son of Fårbaute.. father of lies
Born of earth, unbound by laws

The salmon glides in the waterfall
The eagle sails with the wind
Hammer groans in Jotun scull
The under ground spurts fire

Laughter, deceit, beauty and contempt
The old norse god's protector and leader of Jotuns

3. Fenris
Glem alle lover, all orden og fred
Kaos er allt; ingen tid eller sted
Nå når alt lys og liv tar slutt
Når vinden nå dreper;
Lenkene er brutt!

Tiden er kommet
som nornene forutså
intet varer evig
slaget på Vigrid skal stå
det finnes ingen brødre
det finnes ingen sterke band
Det brundne raseri er løs
indre kulde er fri
en elv av fråde
er tørket ut
Ulvens kraft, det dunkle hat
Ser ikke lenger en grense
Ty. Din hånd for fred du gav
Men de siste sår kan fred ei lindre

Angrboda med rette
bar sitt navn
med Lauvøus sønn hun alvet frem
angst, hat og død
et varselskrik I mørket
bergets røtter, Bjørnesner
Kvinneskjegg, kattetrinns lyd
pust fra fisken , fuglens spytt
temmede krefter fra svunnen tid
boldt Vår ulv lenket
Mene i til evig tid

Fenris er løs!

Nå er vår visdom
Slukt av gammelt hat
De ni skritt er fullendt
En ny vei er lagt

[English translation:]

Forget all laws, all order and peace
Chaos is everything; no time or place
Now when all light and life ends
When the wind now is killing
The chains has broken...

The time has come
As the norns predicted
Nothing lasts forever
The battle at Vigrid shall come
There is no brothers
There is no strong bounds
The bound anger is loose
Inner coldness is free
A river of foam
Has dried up
The power of the wolf, obscure hate
No longer sees a limit

Angrboda beared
Her name justly
With Lauyíus son she breeded
Dread, hate and death
A cry of warning in the dark
The mountains roofs, bear tendors
Woman beard, the sound of catsteps
Breath from the fish, spit from the bird
Tamed forces from a forgotten time
Has held our world in chains
But not for ever!

Fenris is loose

Now our wisdom
Is swallowed by ancient hate
The nine steps are fulfilled
A new road is lain

4. Black Mountain Plateaus (Svarte Vidder)
The ravens are flying, the one eyed watches
Into the fog, shadows appear
Memories from the first empire covered with gold
Runes scratched in, scratches in by hatred
The hordes of the one eyed are riding once again
Hammer crushes cross
Inverted by the unbound
Dark clouds gather, the light retreats

Burned landscape, where it earlier bloomed
Battle fields for the first
A black empire, eternal winter
Frozen fields, eternal cold
Lightening and thunder commands from the first
Eternal storms, an evil monsoon
A wall of darkness
The voice is calling, the circle completed

The age of wolves
Hunger and despair
Mother earth
Expect your death

Warriors are gathered through the dream
Re-conquering the old norse throne
Under new flags
With the swords held high
The ravens are flying, the one eyed watches
Into the fog, shadows appear
Falling icons in a holy war
Black mountain plateaus the battle is won

The age of wolves
Hunger and despair
Mother earth
Expect your death

5. Yggdrasil
I know that I hung
In the windcold tree
Nine whole nights
With hurt point
To Oden given
Self given to myself
In that tree
Which nobody knows
From which roots it ran

not given bread
They brought no horns
Saw down from the tree
Took up runes
Took them with screams
And down from the tree I fell

Nine magic songs I got
From the famous son of
Boltorn, Bestlas father
And a drink I got
Of precious mead
Poured by Odrere

Then I became vigorous
And got wise
Grew and felt well
Of word sought word
Me word again
Of work sought work
Me work again

6. Jotunblod
Bottomless abyss, ginnungagap
Darkness without end before the morning of time
The cold empire's eleven rivers frozen
Frost mist spreads itself wide out
The gust from Nivlhel in the north fills the mighty gap
Licking tongues of fire from the south
Boiling, bubbling venom

All life has it's origin in a source of
Jotunblood
Your mind's own evil inner:
Jotunblood

Screams from Hvergelmes source
United with nauseating drops of venom
The first, the father of all families
Created by the two elements
With himself he breeded
Our proud ancestors
Our primitive force's deep roots
With energy from the cattle's four rivers

A knife through the dark
A shrill scream
A pale face foams
He wanders proudly over Ymer's bones

All life has it's origin in a source of
Jotunblood
Your mind's own evil inner:
Jotunblood

If one seeks all Midgard's knowledge
If the wise woman swings her staff
One can not avoid one's origin
The chaos of the primitive force:
Jotunblood

7. Gylfaginning
He wandered on fine old paths
He wandered along high ridges
He wandered towards the heart of Midgard
He wandered until he saw a mountain

Over a bridge wet with dew he walked
Through the golden gate of Asgard
He saw the vigorous gardens of gods
Crowned around the father of All's high castle

'O father of all, I Ganglere ask:
How have we all come to existence and where do we end?
Answer, O high, even high and third
what is mankind and the race of gods' faith?'

Gylfaginning, deception for he who was wrongly taught
But not for the one who knows Gylfaginning
Grimnes revelation

8. Wotan
Naked, waste landscape
Vast plains lead to the seashore in the west
A northern wind sweeps over dead bodies
A stranger has entered the domains of the vikings

Die not lying sick, dastardly coward
Draw sword, fight with the war gods
Wotan!

We shall fight until we see Ritrost
We shell fight until Heimdal flows the Gjallarhorm
We shall fight for our domains
We shall fight with the war gods
Wotan!

Die not lying sick, dastardly coward
Draw sword, fight with the war gods
Wotan!

9. Queen Of The Ice Desolates (Isöders Dronning)
On the balcony she beholds and longs
Queen of the ice desolates
Alone and weeping she bears the sorrow
Queen of the ice desolates

In the land where day is night and night is day
Bulks a castle with walls of ice, covered with white frost
Outside these walls exists no life
Memories of warmth frozen into snow crystals

In the land where the wind weeps, the child of tragendy lives
Horn of frost and cold, dressed in the snow
Bears who form to pearls run from her eyes
...Memories of joy frozen into pearls of ice

the woman in the castle of ice bears the curse
There where she will die
Queen of the ice desolates

A lonely raven passes by
It seeks further on towards the warmth
On wings it is free
The woman in the castle bears the curse
There she will die, but will anybody
Remember?

5. Heimdallr
[performed by Enslaved]Heimdall is the name of an Old Norse God; 
He is called the Old White Norse God; 
He is great and holy; 
His teeth are made of gold; 
His horse is named Goldtop. 
He lives where it's called the mountain in the sky besides 
Bifrost. 
He needs less sleep than a bird; 
He sees night as clear as day 
One thousand miles away from where he is; 
He also hears the grass grow from the soil, 
Or the wool on the sheep and everything that can be heard. 
He possess the horn that is called the Gjallarhorn, 
And they can hear him blowing the horn in all the homes.

1. 793 (Slaget Om Lindisfarne)
[793 (The Battle Of Lindisfarne)]

[Lyrics by Grutle Kjellson 1995/96]
[Music by Ivar Bjørnson 1995/96]

Strokes from oars could be heard,
Beautiful ships gushed through the sea
Like a wind from the north,
Our ancestors reached the shore
Men from Hordaland, Rogaland and Adger
Gathered for battle in common
Proud men with no fear
Strokes from the sword crushed the skull of the christian

A long time we ruled, kings of the north
Many battles we won, at the shores of Midgard
But, betrayed by our own brothers
We were forced down on our knees
Now when the wind once again is howling
The thoughts finally goes towards home
We shall rise in our glory
The white horde will for sure shiver

"We died like men
Therefore we never vanished
Weak is the one the enemy loves
Never betray your origin"

[Norwegian]

Åretak hørtes, vakre langskip fosset frem
Som en vind fra nord, kom våre fedre i land
Horder, Ryger og Egder, samlet til felles strid
Staute menn uten frykt
Sverdslag knuste kristmanns skalle

Lenge herkset vi, Nordens konger
Mange slag vi vant ved Midgards strender
Men, sveket av våre enge, ble vi tvunget ned i kne
Når vinden nå igjen jager, vender tankene omsider hjem
Vi skal reise oss i vår prakt
Sannelig skal kvitehorden skjelve

"Vi falt som menn
Derfor døde vi ei hen
Veik er den som fiender elsker
Svik ei ditt opphav"

2. Hordalendingen
[The Man From Hordaland]

[Lyrics by Grutle Kjellson 1995]
[Music by Ivar Bjørnson 1995]

Waves are cutting like a knife of time
On the slippery rocks that still stands besides the shore
Two eyes are eyeing the seas
Towards the seas that once brought his ancestors glory

A lonely mind is longing
For the raising of sails
A swordarm is longing hungrily
To cut the throats of cowards

A forgotten treasure is now recovered
Brought out from the darkness of Midgard
Its powers will never again disappear
It is guarded by a man from Hordaland

A night of sorrow will soon be over
Memories from ancient times will glow
A wind blows away the dust from an ancient sword
Two ravens will predict his return

The sets in the west
He lifts his proud face
He looks towards the North Star
The Man From Hordaland

[Norwegian]

Bølgene skærer som en tidens kniv
På de glatte svaberg som ennå står
To øyne skuer utover de hav
Som i fordums tider bar hans slekt til heder

Et stille sinn lengter
Etter atter å heise seil
En sverdram hungrer
Etter nidmanns strupe

En bortglemt skatt er nå gjennfunnet
Båret ut fra Midgards mørke
Den kraft skal aldri mer forsvinne
Den voktes av en mann fra Hordaland

En sorgtung natt er snart over
Et fordums minne lyser opp
En vind blåser støv fra et gammelt sverd
To ravner varsler hans komme

Solen går ned i vest
Han løfter sitt stolte ansikt
Han skuer mot Nordstjernen
Mannen fra Hordaland

3. Alfablot
[Sacrifice To The Elves]

[Lyrics by Grutle Kjellson 1993/96]
[Music by Ivar Bjørnson 1996]

Bring forth your sacrifice
The winter can last for long
Show them honour
Servants of Frey
Let the blood flow
On his pride
Until they are pleased
To provide our magnificense and growth

Our king will show his wrath
If we do not honour our promise
Poor the harvest will be
Without seeds in earth

Don't spill the finest blood
Strong sons will not be born too often

"Oh, wise Volve when shall I get to see, fields of growth
When shall I once again feel the light touch from Freyas hands"

Death comes fast
If you do not honour
The people below
The friends of the Vanirs
Bring forth
The holy boar
Then the sun will still shine
And we can still breath

We didn't wish to die
We didn't wish to awake
The wrath of the elders
Bring forth the holy boar

[Norwegian]

Bring frem ditt offer
Vinteren kan lett bli lang
Vis dem ære
Frøys undersåtter
La blodet renne
Over hans stolthet
Til de er begjæret
For vår prakt og vår grøde

Vred blir vår konge
Hvis ei vårt løfte blir holdt
Skral blir den avling
Som ei er blitt sådd

Spill ei det beste blod
Sterke sønner fødes ei i overflod

"Kloke volve når skal jeg få se, Grøderike enger"
"Når skal jeg igjen få føle, Frøyas myke hender"

Døden kommer fort
Om en ikke ærer
Folket der under
Vaneguders frender
Bring fram
Den hellige Galte
Så solen ikke slukner
Så vi fremdeles kan ånde

Vi ønsket ei å dø
Vi ønsket ei å vekke
De eldstes harme
Bring fram den hellige Galte

Spill ei det beste blod
Sterke sønner fødes ei i overflod

"Kloke volve når skal jeg få se, Grøderike enger
"Når skal jeg igjen få føle, Frøyas myke hender"

4. Kvasirs Blod
[The Blood of Kvasir]

[Lyrics by Grutle Kjellson 1996]
[Music by Ivar Bjørnson & Grutle Kjellson 1996]

A war ruled in ancient times
Between the holy races, the Vanirs and the Aces
When peace came, the deities united
From a bowl filled with spit rose Kvasir

"Wise he becomes, he drinks the holy mead
The blood of Kvasir, but not he who drinks
From the spilled mead that dripped
From the falcon"

Kvasir the father of poets by dwarf hands he died
From the blood of Kvasir they made the mead of poets,
The holy drink
Fjalar and Galar once murdered Gilling the Giant,
The father of Suttung
Enraged, Suttung demanded justice to be fullfilled
The blood of Kvasir became the mead of Suttung

Grimne flew out from Valhalla
In the shape of the falcon
To the home of Giants and to Nitberg
Bauge was decived, and Gunnlod betrayed

Out from Nitberg the falcon flew
Finally Kvasir should return to Aasgard
But when the mead disappeared Suttung became furious
Out, in the shape of the eagle he followed
Sadly, Grimne had to spill from his valuable treasure
Which led to the making of the false poets
The falcon flew home to his domains
And Suttung flew into the flames of Tjalve

[Norwegian]

I gammel tid hersket det en krig
Mellom de hellige slekter, baner og æser
Da freden kom, ble guddommene forent
Opp fra et kar med spytt steg Kvarsir

"Vis blir den som drikker av mjøden,
Kvarsis blod, men ei den som drikker
Av den spillte mjød som dryppet fra
Falkens ham"

Kvarsir, hvis skalders far han var,
Ble tatt av dage av dvergehender
Av Kvarsirs blod lagde de skaldemjøden deh hellige drikk
Fjalar og Galar myrdet en gang Gilling jotun, Suttungs far
I Sinne krevde Suttung mannebot
Kvarsir blod ble Suttungs mjød

Ut fra Valhall flasket Grimne
Kledd opp i falkens drakt
Til Jotunheimen og Nitberg
Bauge bie narret og Gunnlod sveket

Ut fra Nitberg falken fløy
Omsider skulle Kvarsir hjem,
Men da mjøden forsvant ble Suttung vred
Ut han styrtet i ørneham

Akk, måtte Grimne slippe dyrebar last
Slik ble de falske skalder skapt
Falken fløy hjem til sin borg
Og suttung inn i Tjalves flammer

5. For Lenge Siden
[A Long Time Ago]

[Lyrics by Grutle Kjellson 1995]
[Music by Ivar Bjørnson 1995]

Hymns were sung
In the times when our people still were proud
In the long gone past
A long time ago

Then came the disease
The disease from south
Deception and false knowledge
Infected our minds

Survival of the fittest was forgotten
But still it didn't disappear
Beneath the layers of a thousand years of deception
Burns the ancient northern thoughts

Fight! Don't let your powers disappear
Our sunset shall also be our dawn

They burned our temples
They killed our men
We shall take back
What once were ours

Fight! Deny not your mind
Our sunset shall also be our dawn

We shall once again sing
Hymns from ancient times
Like we did in those days
A long time ago

[Norwegian]

Lovsanger ble sunget
Den gang folket fremdeles var stolt,
I de svundne tider,
For lenge siden

Så kom pesten
Pesten fra sør
Svik og vranære
Forpestet våre sinn

Den sterkes lov ble glemt
Men forsvant ei
Under et lag av tusen års svik
Ulmer den norrøne tanke

Kjemp! La ei din kraft forgå
Vår morgen skal også bli vår kveld

De brente våre hov
De drepte våre menn
Vi skal ta tilbake
Det som engang var vårt

Kjemp! Fornekt et ditt sinn
Vår morgen skal også bli vår kveld

Vi skal igjen synge
Lovsanger fra fordums tid
Slik vi gjorde i de dager
For pesten kom
FOR LENGE SIDEN

6. Glemt
[Forgotten]

[Lyrics and Music by Ivar Bjørnson]

The silence inside this place is screaming
Here, were the roses never wither, as they never bloomed
Here the sun never shone
Even the darkness never came in

No hope, no fear
An ocean of tears, that never fell
Tomorrow brings remembrance of opened wounds
The light invaded the endless darkness

A soul, which birth was denied
A soul that became forgotten

The darkness fades away even the brightest colour
The street is empty, and leads to nowhere
A shrilling scream, that no one heard
Who cares? We can all be free

"Tomorrow is a new day
But today was new as well...
... For only thing is fear fealt
The fear of life"

Fallen asleep, wrapped in a blood red blanket
Two dead eyes are staring into emptiness
From a soul, which birth was denied
Death greets the one life forgot

[Norwegian]

Hvor stillheten er øredøvende her inne
Hvor rossene aldri visner, da de aldri blomstret
Her fant solen aldri frem
Selv mørket snur i døren

Intet håp, ingen frykt
Et hav av tårer som aldri rant
Morgendangen bringer bud om åpnede sår
Lyset invaderte det endeløse mørket

Den klareste farge blir dim om natten
Gaten er tom og leder ingensteds
Et strik som skar, men ingen hørte
Hvem bryr seg? Vi kan alle bli fri

"I morgen er en ny dag,
Men det var også i dag...
...Blott den ene frykten kjennes
Frykten for lyvet"

Sovnet inn, i ei blodrødt pledd
To døde øyne stirrer tomt
Fra en sjel som ble nekter født
Døden hilset den som lyvet glemte

7. Eld
[Fire]

[Lyrics by Grutle Kjellson 1996]
[Music by Ivar Bjørnson & Grutle Kjellson 1996]

Born in a flames in the time before time
In the sparkling embrace of Muspellheim
Born to be your souls darked depths
Before Audhumla, our ancient mother awakened

When your eyes is glowing with hate
A hate older than both men and gods
Then you see the light of Muspell
To strong for any man to tame
The oldest force will man never understand
In the deepest domains of fire, man can never reign

Stronger than the grip of death
Mightier than the lights of Norns
Wiser than Fimbul-Tul
More betraying than the son of Faarbaute

That, who once brought forth life
And gave us Mother Earth
Shall return in the flames of Surt
Our flesh shall burn at Ragnarok
Our souls shall be united in FROST & FIRE

[Norwegian]

Føydd i flammar i tida før tid
I muspellheimens gneistrande famm
Føydd til sjelas djupaste mørke
Før Audhumla urmor vakna

Når augo lyser av eit hat
Eldre enn gudar og menn
Då ser ein muspells ljos
Som ikkje mann kan temja
Den eldste kraft vil me aldri skjøna
Djupt ned i eldriket vil mann aldri rå

Sterkare enn daudens grep
Mektigare enn nomenes ljos
Klokare enn Fimbul-Tul
Meir svikfull enn Fårbautes son

Det som ein gong bar fram liv
Og gav oss vår Moder Jord
Skal venda attende i Surts flammar
Vår lekam skal brennast ved Ragnarok
Våre sjeler bindast i Frost og Eld

ENSLAVED LYRICS


1. Living Beneath The Hammer
Windswept landscape, desolated mountain plateaus
The Deepest woods and darkest scrubs
Flords and mountains are our landmarks
in a life beneeath the Hammer

A long and narrow kingdom
Ruled by trinity
From stormy mountain tops covered with snow
We behold the kingdom of the Hammer

We ride along the paths of Midgard
Fog from the soil rises at our feets
To the west the shore can be seen,
where the first sat foot ashore
Where they raised sail towards north

2. A Winter's Night
A dark, chilling winters night
Unsilently awoken by song and dance
From above rains the golden arrows of Thor
Moonbeams enlighten the ring

Nine torches for those nine in the circle
Surrounded by nine shadows for nine souls
In the middle, an altar of fire, soil, water and wind
Look, and behold yourself

3. Fires Of Midgard
The call of the Gjallarhorn
Return to the ring of our forefathers gods
The flames of Midgard's fires and ancient mystisism still are

]sg}rdsreien rides with terror above the village
Mjolner is swung, thunder and lightening!
The landmarks of the Vikings
Wolves and ravens guards the throne

4. Heimdallr
Heimdall is the name of an Old Norse God;
he is called the Old White Norse God;
he is great and holy;
his teeth are made of gold;
his horse is named Goldtop.
He lives where it's called the mountain in the sky besides
Bifrost.
He needs less sleep than a bird;
he sees night as clear as day
one thousand miles away from where he is;
he also hear the grass grow from the soil,
or the wool on the sheep and everything that can be heard.
He possess the horn that is called the Gjallarhorn,
and they can hear him blowing the horn in all the homes.

2. I Lenker Til Ragnarok
[Loke - del II]
[##-Voluspå]
[Tekst: Grutle Kjellson]

Eiteren drypp, jorda skakar
Eg vrir meg i smerte, lenka til berget

Eg er din angst, eg er din pine.
Tema meg du freista, du fanga meg i garn.
Eg let meg ikkje rokka, eg er kaos
eg er din skam.

Eg er din øvste visdoms bror,
og din fiende til din døyande dag.

Bunden eg er, men eg ler av deg.
Tru ikkje eg er til for å tena deg.

Eg er av ei verd du aldri (i ditt liv) kan skjøna,
for eg er vondskap, eg er urkraft.

Ein dag skal me møtast på Vigridsletta.
Ein dag er eg fri for lenker og eiter.
Den dagen vil du skjøna kvifor eg blei til,
kvifor latteren gjallar i natta.
Den dagen skal me kjempa vår siste kamp,
og ta kvarandre av dage.
# ...Sola svartnar, jord sig i hav
på hummelen bleiknar bjarte stjerner
Røyken velatr fra veldige bål
Høgt leikar flammen
mot himmelen sjøl... #

[English translation: IN CHAINS UNTILL RAGNAROK]

[Lyrics: Grutle Kjellson]
[## Voluspå]

The ether is dripping, the earth is quaking
I am writhing with agony, chained to the mountain

I am your fear, I am your torment
You attemped to tame me, you caught me in nets
I will not be budged, I am chaos, I am your shame

I am your highest wisdom, and your enemy
'til your dying day

Bound I am, but I am laughting  at you
Do not believe that I am here to serve you

I am from a world you can not comprehend
'Cause I am Evil I am the Primal Force

One day we shall meet at the fields of Vigrid
One we  I shall be free of chains and ether
That day you will understand
The purpose of my excistance 
Why the laughter is roaring in the night
Åhat day we will fight our last battle
Ônd end eachothers  days

#The sun turns black, ground slides into the sun
Brave stars are fading in the sky
Smoke rises from great fires
The flame plays up high
Against heaven itself#

[Music: Ivar Bjørnson]

3. Urtical Gods
[Lyrics: Dirge Rep]

Activate the aggression that exposes the
Hidden,
Denying the existance  pf  praying to
Illusions
Seek gnosis in the forbidden
Drink from the wates of knowledge
And see what lies you breathe

Absorb the vital spark of deities false
And ressurect the true gods
To whom strength and wisdom is the key
And not the lectures of folly
Annoint your sould  with pleasure
Apposed  to mummifications through impotence

The truth is unconscious, asleep
Waiting to be summoned, to be worshipped
A neglected phallos, banished from thought
A weapon overseen by the creator
But cherished by those of the path
Unlock the beast
Transform

4. Ansuz Astral
[Tekst: Ivar Bjørnson]

ANSUZ, ANSUZ!
- Skipet fa frå kai
Aldri vil ho vende att;
ho er trygg i stjernenatt

WUNJO, WUNJO!
- Reisa har vërt lang
Han som sød kjem draumen til;
tek han dit han draume vil

Vidare frå tanken;
fri frå kjød
Ingen svar, ingen sirkel
Evig fødsel, evig død

"...Eg tok og eg fekk
Eg fall, flaug og gjekk
Det vart mørkt og eg såg
Djupt ned, kor det tyste rår..."

Me vandra fritt og langt
Lyset kom, og synet svann
Husa er tomme, og himmelen raud;
Skipet legg frå kai

[Musikk: Ivar Bjørnson & R. Kronheim]

[English translation: ANSUZ ASTRAL]

[Lyrics: Ivar Bjørnson]

ANSUZ, ANSUZ!
The ship left for the sea
Never will she return
She is safe in the starry night

WUNJO, WUNJO!
The journey's been long
The dream comes to the sleeping
Brings him where he longs to dream

Further from thought,
free from the flesh
No answers, no circles
eternal birth, eternal death

"...I took and received
I fell, flew and walked
It was dark and I saw
Deep below, where silence roars..."

We wandered far and freely
The light came, and the sight faded
The houses are abandoned, and the sky is red
The ship is leaving for the sea.

5. Nidingaslakt
[Tekst: Grutle Kjellson]

Horna gjallar, vinden bles
Trommer dundrar, vinded bles
Med spjut og boge meter til strid
Me går i bresjen brødre gjennom blod.
Med von om ëre i galskapens namn
Me vert aldri slegn sjøl om me fell

Me reiser ei til Folkvang til,
vanedronnings famn, våre fedre skal
me møta om me fell i dag.
Me flytar ei frå var lagnad sjølv
om vinden ikkje bles vår vei.
Til valfaders hall brødre.

Med heva spjut i Odins namn.
Me skal heva krus i Odins namn
Nidingar skal falla for våre føtter.
Dei treng ikkje be om sollyse dagar.
Ingen hugsat ein trëll uten herre
Slegne vert dei når dei fell.

Me hevar våpen for vår tru
Me slaktar marken for vår tru
Ingen nåde me viser
for dei som snudde ryggen til.
Døy skal dei som freista
å mura brunnen inn.
ei som for med løgn og svik
Gje oss styrke, gje oss mot
Me skal sigra, brødre gjennom blod.

[Musikk: R. Kronheim]

[English translation: NIDINGASLAKT]

[Lyrics: Grutle Kjellson]

Horns are resounding, the winds are howling
Drums are pounding, the winds are howling
With spear and bow we go into battle
We are making a stand, brothers in blood
With hope for honour in the name of madness
We will never be defeated, even if we fall

We are not going to Folkvang,
Into the arms of the Vanir Queen,
We shall  our fathers if we fall today
We will not flee from our destiny,
even though the winds aren't blowing our way
Brothers, to Valfaders hall

With spear raised in the name of Oden
We shall raise mugs in the name of Oden
Cowards shall fall at our feet
They do not have to pray for sun filled days
No one remembers a slave without a master
Defeated they are when they fall

We raise weapons for our faith
We slaughter the fields for our faith
We have no mercy for those
Who turned their backs
Those who attemmp to close the well
Shall die
Those who lied and betrayed shall die
Give us strenght , give us courage
We will prevail
Brothers in blood

6. Eit Auga Til Mimir
[Tekst: R. Kronheim, Grutle Kjellson, Dirge Rep]

Utgards mørke, langt der ute
Eg kjem ikkje inn, eit offer du krev?
Eit offfer eg krev, ingen lovnad eg gjen
Eg kan gje deg styrke, eg kan gje deg dauden
De seier du kan ta meg av dage.
Du seier du kan ta meg av dage.
Men utan meg er heller ikkje du
Skapar av svakhet, meg kan du ikkje truga.
Lær deg å sjå med det retta auga.
Du dunkle, du freistar å få meg i knt,
du taler i gåter, og får meg vred.
Med vrede, du veike, du ingenting får.
Din visdom eg krev for at du skal forstå
Du vil eg skal lida, og endå til dõy.
Du gløymer mi makt, at du er min trëll.
Ditt opphav du gløymer. Du prisar bedrag
Di verd er ei faginning, ingen heilhet, ingen svar
Orden eg skaper, men du motstrebar meg
Du talar med klõrt, kva er det du krev.
Eg krev eit offer, eg krev at du blør.
Du våga å trosse dei eldste, som bar deg fram

"Utgards mørke langt der ute, eit offer vart krevd,
eit offer dei fekk, Eit sinn vart styrka, men
lekam gjekk tapt, Klok vert den som veit å våga"

"Han ofra sitt auge, for at fjan skulle sjå
Han blødde for dei som til slutt lot han rå.
Men ingen lovnad ei ga ham, det vart ingen fred.
Dei skal fframleis kjempa, til jorda sig ned"

[Musikk: Grutle Kjellson]

[English translation: AN EYE FOR MIMIR]

[Lyrics: R. Kronheim, Grutle Kjellson, Dirge Rep]

The darkness of Utgard, far out there
I can not enter, are you demanding sacrifce ?
I demand a sacrifice, no promise I will give
I can provide you with strenght , I can give you death

You say you can end my days
But without my excistance , would you not be
Creator of weakness, me you can not threaten
Learn how to see with the right eye
Obscure One, you attemp to get me on my knees
You speak through riddles, and call forth my wrath
With wrath, weakling, nothing is achieved
I demand your wisdom, to make you understand
You want me to suffer, and even to die
You are forgetting my power, you are but my slave
Your source of origin you're forgetting, your praising deceit
Your world is an illusion; no wholeness, no answer
Order I crfeate, but your opposing me
Your speaking with a cunning tongue, what are your demands
I am demanding a sacrifice, I demand to see you bleed
You have dared to oppose the Ancient Ones that brought you into excistance


The darkness  of Utgard, a sacrifice was demanded, a sacrifice they received
A mind was strengthened, but the flesh was lost
He who dares becomes wise

"He gave his eye to see
He bled for those who let him rule at last
But no promises they gave him, no peace became
They shall still be fighting 'til the earth sinks"

[Music: Grutle Kjellson]

7. Blodhemn
[Tekst: Grutle Kjellson]

Du drap min son, fjemn eg svergar
Du øydela min veg, og fred med mitt folk
Du sverta mitt namn, dei trudde deg

D trudde min lagnad var spott og spe
Du trudde eg med mitt banesår døydde
Du trudde eg aldri skulle reisa meg

Du trudde lyset var din ven,
at du av dt var komen
Du trudde ale ville lystra ddeg
og gløyme valfaders gåver

Du gløymde din far sine vise ord
om svik, lagnad og død.
Du gløymde di plikt
som ein kjempande mann
og drap din bror i sveven.

Du trudde tid lækjar såê
ôå üøåå àùäë ûëãääó åøäïîó ùï èóþ
Âã ïäøymde meg og mi heilage plikt,
eg skal drepa eg i vrede.

Blodhemn eg svergar,
Blodhemn har eg alltid sverga.

[English translation: VENGEANCE IN BLOOD]

[Lyrics: Grutle Kjellson]

You killed my son, I am swearing revenge
You destroyd my path, and truce with my peaople
You blackended my name, they believed you

You saw my destiny as mockery
You was me dying with my fatal wound
You thought I would never rise

You thought the light was your friend,
That you sprung from it
You thought everyone would obey your words
And forget the gifts of Valfather.

You forgot your father's wise words
of betrayal, destiny and death
You forgot your duty as a man of strife,
and killed your brother sleeping

You thought time would heal the wounds,
that my people would forgive and pray
You forgot about me and my holy duty
I will kill you with anger

Vengeance in blood I swear
Vengeance in blood I have always sworn

[Music: Ivar Bjørnson, R. Kronheim]

8. Brisinghamen
[Tekst: Grutle Kjellson]

Einsam ho gret, den vakraste av alle
Fanga og låst i ei sorg ingen skjøner

Gleden forsvann langt, langt der ute.
Ei brennande lyst, en ingen håp.
Ho lengtar heim, men finn ingen veg.
Ein sorgfull lagnad gøymt bak eit smil.

Mardol du fagre for fred du blei ofra
Du solgte din lekam, men fann ingen trøyst.
Det som glimrar gjer ikkje fred for deg

Gern du ga deg hen, og slokka mangt
eit begjær. Men, framleis drypp
det om natta gull frå dine auge.

Frøya, od skal du finna når alt er forbi
då skal du bli sluppen fri.
Inntil den dag finn du inga trøyst.
Sjøl ikkje i glitrande Brisinghamen.

[Musikk: R. Kronheim & Ivar Bjørnson]

[English translation: BRISINGHAMEN]

[Lyrics: Grutle Kjellson]

In solitude she cries, the most beautiful of them all
Captured and locked in a sorrow no one can conceive
Joy vanished far out there
Burning desire, but no hope
She longs for home, bu tcan not find a way
A dismal destiny hidden behind a smile

Mardol, you glorious, sacrificed for peace you were
You sold your flesh, but found no comfort
That which glitters does not bring you peace

Gern you devoted yourself
and consumed many desire.
But, still in the night,
gold is dripping from your eyes.

Frõya, Od you shall find when everything ends
Then you shall be set free
Untill that day you shall find no comfort
Not even in the shining Brisinghamen

[music: R. Kronheim & Ivar Bjørnson]

9. Suttungs Mjød
[incl. Outro "Perkulator"]

[Tekst: Trad.]

[104]
Jotungubben eg fann
er no attende komen
der få ting eg teiande fekk
med mange ord
eg mykje til gagn
vann meg i Suttungs salar

[105]
Gunnlòd meg gav på gullstolen
drykk av den dyre mjød
vesal løn let eg ho få
ho gav meg trygt si tru,
ho gav meg heile sin hug

[106]
Rata-Tonni rudde meg veg
gardt grjot ho gnog
over og under var jotunvegar,
då gjekk det på livet laust

[107]
Det vene eg vann, eg vel hev n¢ti
lite den vise vantar
med di Odrere no opp er komen
midt i Midgards fjeim

[108]
Uvisst å vita om eg endå var
komen or Jotungarden ut, om ikkje
Gunnlòd, det gode kvendet, hadde
vorti min sële ven

[109]
Andre dagen av gjekk rimtussa
til å spørje råd av råd av Hår
i Håvahalli; etter Bolverk dei spurde,
om han var berga hjå gudom,
eller Suttung hadde slegi han ned

[110]
Ein eid då svor
Odin på ringen,
kven kan hans trygdemål tru?
Suttung han sveik for (skalde) drykken,
og Gunnlòd sårt han grøtte

ENSLAVED LYRICS


1. Convoys To Nothingness
Faces - eyes - noise

Floating patterns of no coherency, none needed

From behind the chapel of dreams came imagery
From another world
The left for a brighter star
A new home called "now"

Womb - death - dawn

Follow seafarers on an ocean of silence
Remaining humanoid shells, a distant thought
The chasm between truth and flesh paved
With bricks from secret cities

Entering linear orbit
Crushing the foundations of divided times
Suns reflected

Convoys...
Convoys to...
Convoys to nothingness...

2. The Voices
I hear their poisonous words again
As they call out for submission and code
"To be less than one and drown equals pride" they say
These were the voices that destroyed us

Did I want for this loss to be sustained?

Through the clipping of wings found the secret paths
From the blinding light of lies obtained second sight
Stabbed in the back, gained strength in One-ness
Taken from me, I learned to preserve

These were the voices that sunk our ships
These are the voices - poisoned ears bleeding

Did I pray for the dead to be kept awake?
Did I gently place these thorns through the surface
of my eyes?
Did I ask for this fathomless tragedy to go on forever?

Fail to comply - reborn in war
The answer being no

Did I?

3. Vision: Sphere Of The Elements (A Monument Part II)
Betrayed by disillusion
Enslaved by insanity
Enslaved by commitment to betrayal
Betrayed by all elements

My vision is clear and strong
I comfort myself to fulfil it
There exists no edge
Clearly existence is wrong

I kill myself to fulfil my vision
Consumed by astral interference
I deny this monument to be my sphere
I choke this ego to find that i'm dead
I deny this monument to be my sphere

I will die as one

4. Hollow Inside
Hollow inside - I didn't sleep too well last night
Step over, turn the light
Hollow inside - I didn't dream too much last night
Step over, turn the light

Knock on the door - these are the interfering themes
Open it up, too soon

Shorter in time - the interactive parts go by
I fear for a while - my head

I fear for a while - that my head will expand
And stretch out in to the stratos wild

Can't you see, those birds in limbo breaks
And of course you hear, listen, the straws
From above you, and underneath in the glow
I can touch them
Spiritualized

Dogs with bones, they are released
One too many to get on

5. The Cromlech Gate
[The fool:]
"Fear not dear kinsmen, cause you
Saviour I am. I'll bring back our glory
And wisdom Achieve I'm searching the
Old path to bring back the elder"

Smug as only the fool can be, mindless
Blindly. He marches towards his fate
Summoned by the Cromlech by hunger within

[Voice from a parallel existance:]
"Come inside my friend, your father is waiting.
Your search ends here, Wisdom you have
gained, the signs you have read."

Doomed to walk the smiths dungeons
Underworld slavery
Through the eyes of the fool nothing can be seen
The elder is hiding beyond thoughts
Only leaving with glimpses of long lost knowledge

I once saw the Cromlech and was kindly invited
But I stayed the beast I kissed the ground
(I drank the wine)
(I took up the runes)
I found the home of the elder

6. Enemy I
It was here I was born
While the stars held their breaths
After ages of pseudo-presence

I climbed the final steps
Up from deep beneath the shores
Eieth no longer sleeping gal

Thus alive and the stillness
Only to be broken by whispers
Towards the moon

Bloodred from the Unborn Ones cries
That will not be silenced or rest
Forever more and awaken not

To paint in blanks or wither
Beauty blinding no more
than the whole is less now

We see clearly what was not there
The prey become predator
Slaughtering not raging blindly

Through tunnels of sorrow and lust
For solitude and peace of mind
Says it is time to unmask and face

Behind lines  - that is Enemy I

7. Smirr
He sees his world through the crystal state of departure
The hooves echo the approach of the third coming
On it's back a goddess with shining black armour
The steel that will separate the will from doing
Closing in as he falls to his knees, surrounded by
Plasma of dying chapters
Life succumbs to silence, desire alone to the dying
Of inner banes
His hands no longer grasping contraction as he laughs

Winds play their mourners dirge through heaps of corpses
The hooves thundering the arrival of the final coming
Carrying forth the seeds of eternal night
So that the Shadow may sleep, eternity weeps
While we laugh and remain forever

She feels the cold floor giving no comfort as she fades 
The hooves echo the approach of the third coming
On it's back the faceless her Elder Ones saw
The agents of microcosmic change shattering the megalith
Stories told, divinity unfold
She passes on, yet remains in Smirr
Cold remains scattered in dead void dreams

8. The Sleep: Floating Diversity (A Monument Part III)
The battle's now past
The war of all was within itself

Painfully sleeping

All hail the fallen
The time is now for the king to tell

The battle's now past

All hail the fallen
Pleading diversity equals no scream
Thickening intensity now fatal
Beyond portrayed dream

9. Outro: Self - Zero

ENSLAVED LYRICS


1. Større Enn Tid, Tyngre Enn Natt
Hanen fall om på tunet
Før han rakk gala
-Men eg kjende tida

Hesten hang i slitte taumar
Med utakk piska inn i augo
-Men eg makta å trekke plogen

Bonden la seg til marka
Grødelaus og ufri
-Men eg rydda nye hov

Vekstane visna, evige lovnadar brast
Fargane falma, hjarta fraus fast
Støyen stilna, men sigeren var tatt
Større enn tid, tyngre enn natt!

Fjella fall, og skogen brann
Tida teia, vatn vart sand
Sola slokna, men deg hadde eg att
Større enn tid, tyngre enn natt!

Lyset tok slutt, og stjernene slokna ;
Før fylgjet nådde fram til gards
-Men eg hugsa vegen

Skipa sank med krigar og skald;
I botnlaus avgrunn lagt til kvile
-Men eg råka nye ukjende strender

Gudane vart alle brått gamle
Då dei gyldne veggane fall
-Men eg gav dei ny kraft

[English translation:]

[LARGER THAN TIME, HEAVIER THAN NIGHT]

The rooster fell dead in the dust
Before the break of dawn
But I knew time

The horse hung from worn out straps
With ungreatfulness
Wipped into his eyes
But I pulled the plow myself

The peasant laid himself down on the fields
Neither plenty nor free - but I cleared new land

Growths withered, eternal oaths shattered
Colours faded, hearts froze cold
The noise silenced, but mine was victory and might
Larger than time - heavier than night

Mountains fell, forestgreen to black
Time turned to silence, water to sand
The sun went cold, gone all but one light
Larger than time - heavier than night

Days ended, and the stars died
Before the wanderers reached home
But I knew the way

Ships sunk with all warriors and heralds
Laid to rest in bottomless pits
But I spotted new and unknown shores

The gods suddenly aged
When the golden walls fell
But I gave them new powers

2. Daudningekvida
Som eit åpent sår
Kven kunne halde ut
Hvis eg fylgjer deg, blir eg som dei?
-Rak i rygg med fana
Til dei hengde

Dei vart som trea, livlause
Snakka ikkje, rørte seg ikkje
Handa kald, auga tomt
(Mimir, lyttar du?)

Det er langt, men trøttnas du ?
Tida står stilla, alt anna er dødt
Blod og kvad
Likgudens sol skin i kvar og
Ein sitt ansikt

Urd svarar med ekko, kva vil du gjera?
Kor la du hammaren, Thurisaz kallar ;
Røska tak i faginningas rot

Dei vart som trea, livlause
Følte ikke, høyrde ikkje
Handa kald, auga tomt
Ymir, lyttar du?

Dei vart som trea, livlause
Ymir, kvifor er du tyst?

[English translation:]

[DEADHYMN]

Like an open wound
Who could endure
If i follow you, will i be like them
Standing tall, with the flag of the hanged ones

They were like the trees
Lifeless - did not speak
Did not move
Cold hand, empty eye (Mimir, do you hear this?)

It is a long journey, but are you growing tired?
Time stands still, everything else is dead
Blood and hymn
The god of corpses' sun
Shines in one and everyone's face

Urd answers in echoes, what will you do?
Where is your hammer
Thurisaz calls: smashed hold of illusion's roots

They were like trees
Lifeless
Did not feel, did not hear
Cold hand, empty eye
Ymir, do you hear this?

They were life trees
Lifeless
Ymir, why are you silent?

3. Entrance / Escape
I am not in there
I am not taking any part in this
There's no comfort where you are
And I won't give you anything

I am close to them mentally
But I am inbetween realities
There is no directions for where I am
They can't find me 'cause I am not in here

4. Ormgard
Ein jotne skrik i lengsel
Aesar druknar i banesår
I sterke armar veks
Gangar full av råte
Fjella let seg ikkje
Lenger løfte

Berre trellen eig
Sin eigen fridom
Når kongar fylgjer
Kristenmanns lov

Kven skal bera fram sølvet
Kven skal vakta bogen
Kven skal døme rett
Når hjarta er av kol

Skinnlaus ormyngel
Kven vil vel kome til
Slik ei verd

Dei storme menn drep
Sitt avkom med sløve sverd
La dei angre, la dei lide
Men trøyst dei ikkje

Gje dei aldri handa,
La dei aldri sjå auget

Tannlaust kjøterpakk
Kven vil vel høyre på slike ord
Kvite krist drep si eiga mor

La dei fryse, la dei svelte
Men trøyst dei ikkje

Om dei få orkar turnen,
Skal me byggja muren
Om dei få orkar turen,
Skal me byggja muren
Om dei få orkar turen
Skal me byggja muren

[English translation:]

[THE HIVE]

A troll screams with longing
Gods drown in fatal wounds
Tunnels of rot grows inside
Strong arms
The mountains will no longer be moved

Only the slave owns his own freedom
When kings follow the laws of christened men

Who will carry forth the silver
Who will guard the bow
Who will judge fairly
With hearts of coal

Worm with no skin
Who would want to
Enter such a world

The great men kill their children with blunt swords
Let them regret
Let them suffer
But give them no comfort

Never give them your hand
Never let them see the eye

Toothless bastards
Who wants to hear such words
The white christ kills his mother

Let them freeze, let them starve
But give them no comfort

If the few endures the journey
Then, we will build the wall
If the few endures the journey
Then we will build the wall
If the few endures the journey
Then we will build the wall

5. Æges Draum
På sytti og tusen favnars djup
Slår ein puls jamnare
Og høgare
Bølger breier seg
Som hjarteslag
Gjennom lidlaus
Mosaikk

Ein vis mann
Tre høgder var han
Kom ein gong
Ned hit og sa:
Det som har vaert,
Var aldri

Då såg dei elva
Brenne, og sola blø
Då såg dei elva brenne
Og sola blø

Ei norne,
Kom ho med
Ned fra røttene
Og livets tre
Alt vil døy og forgå
Stillna skal atter rå
Då høyrde dei
Songen kvelast
Og barna dø

På sytti og tusen favnars djup
Slår ein puls jamnare og høgare
Tomme univers i kvart eit ord
Der oppe, kor draumar døyr

[English translation:]

[AEGE'S DREAM]

Seventy and thousand feet below
A pulse is beating more evenly
And higher
Waves expand like heartbeats
Through silent mosaic

A wise man
Three heights he was
Once came down here and said:
"What was, was never"

Then they saw the river
Burn, and the sun bled
Then they saw the river
Burn, and the sun bled

A norn
She came too
Down from the roots
And the tree of life
"Everything will die and decay
Silence will once again prevail"
Then they heard the song choking
And the children dying

Seventy and thousand feet below
A pulse is beating more
Evenly and higher
Empty universes in every world
Up there, where dreams die

6. Mardraum
Fall i flammar
Fanga under is
Mara rir evig

[English translation:]

[NIGHTMARE]

Fall in flames
Trapped under ice
Ridden by nightmares forever

7. Det Endelege Riket
Det endelege blå
Fremand og løfterikt
I det urgamle raude
Sviv det som ein gong
Kvitt var svart

I sirklar går rika
Frå anna til eit går me

I eigne auger uendelege
Utan auger
Lydlaust ingenting
Frå stjerna flyttas
Fjella; og tåpa ser
Berre stein

I sirklar går rika
Frå anna til eit går me

Klagesongen ingen
Orka høyre
Fyller det tenkande
Rom; tvihald om
Lenker som ikke finst
-Kvifor ikkje leva
Utan dei?

I sirklar går rika
Frå anna til eit går me

Det endelege blå
Ikring ei nådelaus mor
Som skal
Kjaerteikne oss
Med endedagars
Eldskyer

[English translation:]

[THE ENDING EMPIRE]

The ending blue
Obscure and promising
In ancient red it orbits
That which once
white was black

Empires circles time
From other to one we go

Deceived to see eternity
If blinded
Silent nothingness
The mountains are moved
From the stars
And the fool
Sees nothing but stones

Empires circles time
From other to one we go

Moaning no one could
Stand listening to
Fills the inner worlds
Clutching the chains
That does not exist
Why not live
Without them?

Empires circles time
From other to one we go

The ending blue
Around a merciless mother
Who will caress us
With the burning skies
Of the last days

8. Ormgard II : Kvalt I Kysk Høgsong
Buskapen åt hyrden
Og svalt smilande i hjel
Beitet fann dei ikkje

Du elsa din neste,
Og åt di eiga mor
Tapar i eigen strid
Herre i eigne lenker

Du ser mot sola og frys i hjel
Hakka til blods i gyldne bur
Kvalt i kysk høgsong
Du kyssar handa som drap
Din eigen bror

Vaer du sikker,
Eg snur aldri ryggen mot deg
Vaer du sikker,
Eg skal alltid håna deg

Tenk nøye etter
Kva du har skapt
Då du ligg der og døyr
Høyr, der ute kor
Latteren vår ljomar
Tenk etter kva
Som ventar deg,
Du eledige dåre!

Me lo då Ormgard brann

[English translation:]

[THE HIVE II (STRANGLED BY PURITY)]

The herd ate it's shepherd
And starved to death, smiling
They didn't reach the meadows

You loved your neighbour
And ate your own mother
Losing your own war
Slave in your own chains

You look to the sun
And freeze to death
Torn apart in golden cages
Strangled by purity
Kissing the hand that killed your own brother

Be sure of this
I'll never turn my back to you
Be sure of this
I'll always mock you

Consider what you've created
When you're waiting for death
Listen, out there
Where our laugher is resounding
Think of what's waiting for you
You miserable fool!

We laughed as the hive burned

9. Krigaren Eg Ikkje Kjende
Eg for ut i strid
Då dei framande kom
Eg sloss for min heim og min buskap
Eg kjempa dei ned
Med mitt spjut og min boge
Så dei heime kunne eta og sova

Eg drakk og eg skråla
Eg lo og eg skrøyt
Av mine sigrar, mitt mot og min styrke
Eg fortalde om gullet eg fann
Hjå dei eg slakta ned for fote

Eg vakna brått
Ein kald og mørk morgon
Med buskapen daud og trellane rømde
All mjøden var drukken og venene reist

Då la eg i veg til lovande land
For atter å vende heim med aere
Alle som sto i vegen for meg
Skulle kjenne min styrke og vreide

Ved ein flod sto ein gammal og støl mann
Han vokta ein båt som eg trong
Eg skulle hogge han ned
Men sverdet brast og
Den gamle sto der og flirte

"Fattige tåpe, som aldri har skjøna
At ein krigar skal kjempe mot krigar
Aldri du vinn visst du berre ser fram
Og ikkje inn"
Med eit var den gamle vekk
Og vinden tok med seg båten

Ved bredda sto eg og skua
Men nådde ikkje den andre sida
Då starta kampen mot krigaren
Eg alltid trudde eg kjente

[English translation:]

[WARRIOR UNKNOWN]

I went into battle
When the strangers came
I fought for my home and my herd
I struck them down
With my spear and bow
So that those at home could sleep and eat

I drank and yelled
I laughed and bragged
Of my victories, my courage and my strength
I told of the gold I found
At those I had slain before me

Suddenly I awoke
A cold and dark morning
With a dead herd and slaves escaped
All mead and all my friends were gone

That was when I went away to promising land
For once again to return with honour
Everyone that crossed my path
Was to feel my strength and wrath

By a flood stood an old and tired man
He guarded a boat which I needed
I charged to cut him down
But the sword broke
And the old one stood there grinning

"Poor fool, who never had seen
That a warrior shall fight against warrior
You'll never win if you're only looking ahead
And never inwards"
Suddenly the old one was gone
And the wind carried away the boat

By the shore I stood looking
But could not reach the other side
That's when the battle begun
Against the warrior I always thought I knew

10. Stjerneheimen
Eg helsar stova med høgsinn
Der ho byr meg inn i flammar og sjø
I heile si prakt og galskap
...Trygg vert berre han som tør

Heim- til ei stjerneverd av sølv
Heim- ulv, mann og gard

Kenaz- bak panna brenn lyset me eig
Raidho- på tankar over sol og regn
Ansuz- i far vår sitt høgsete

Eg ler mot det heilage hjulet

-Ho vil gje oss svara og lyset;
Vidare sveipas dei med
Atter nytt mørke
....Vis vert berre han som spør

Heim-med stjerner av sølv
Heim-ulv , mann og ard
("Eg er - er eg")

Krigar- be aldri om fred
Husbond- lengt alltid heim
Her vil me samlas
...Om runa spinn

[English translation:]

[STARHOME]

I hail the living room with pride
Greeting me with flames and sea
...only he who dares is safe

Home - to a starworld of silver
Home - wolf, man and house

Kenaz - behind the eyes burns the
Light which we own
Raidho - on thoughts above
The sun and rain
Anzus - at the throne of our father
I laugh towards the holy wheel

She will provide us with answers
And the light
Then again we are swept in
Another darkness
...only he who asks becomes wise

Home - with stars of silver
Home - wolf, man and house
("I am - am I")

Warrior, never ask for peace
Husband, always long for home
Here we will be gathered
...if the rune is spinning

1. Intro: Green Reflection
[Instrumental]

2. Lunar Force
Farewell my brother
Farewell my foe
May death embrace you
Your blood in the darkness flow

You were never meant to rule
Never to light up my father's throne
May you suffer deep below
You tried to deprive (me of) my rightful crown

Fallen, defeated, tricked by Beorc,
The Lunar Force
Behold the sorcerer when you're
Impaled by the sword

Farewell my brother
Farewell my friend
May she have pity with you
We did not wish for your life to end

The day will bleak when
The Old One arrives
The King betrayed by his treacherous mind
Defeated by Beorc, The Lunar Force

3. Isa
Been standing here for ages
Watching the valleys blossom and burn
The pyres of yesterday smells of losing you
Preserved we are, portraits (in the glassy depths)
I picked up the shattered mirror, put them in water
Cold as my dreams

Isa: Still - Standing - Empowered
Isa: Watching you die, with tears of ice
Isa: Detached - Silent - Ecstasy
Isa: We are the dead

We arrived here from different spaces
Bidding the wooden shrines farewell
Concealed within dead lips lies the rope
That forged us and then tore us to shreds
Distant opposite assembly at the shores
They're telling me it's time to let go

A time to burn, a time to build
With your own hands a room within that room
Bring it all towards the centre and tremble
Bring her back from the shadows and kiss her
Retrieve the sword from the abyss
Hold back the tidal wave

Isa: Still - Standing - Empowered
Isa: Watching you die, with tears of ice
Isa: Detached - Silent - Ecstasy
Isa: We are the dead

4. Ascension
Staring across the void, seeing eye to eye in folded space
I see you with the colours and frenzy of the sacred rooms
We've met in those dreams; ice blue water ran towards the green sky
The gods spoke to us in their infancy
Suns waiting for us to smitten them with the flames of our disease
And we did so laughing, giving birth to sunrises in our wake

Never in need of sleep, nor in need of truth
I would never have stayed in this darkness, and we would ascend

The taste of ash, no stars above - No green grass below
The last words set ablaze as we saw the inner imagery
How it all came alive when we no longer reached for it
How it all rose and overwhelmed the speechless (us)

In this house without words we came to be one
In these books without text we found the way

A path along a faded memory, without the fear of finding home

We would never have stayed
We would never have stayed
We would never have stayed in this darkness
We would never have stayed
We would ascend

5. Bounded By Allegiance
Brought here by sorrow
Raised in the depths of fear

Consuming sanity
Feasting on the joy of Man

Surrounding the trembling mind
Surrounding the troubled soul
Strength failed to tame the serpent
The offspring of laughter and sadness
Saved by the power of its kin
Obeying the whispering chaos
Pulsating underneath your skin
Feasting 'till the end of time

Denying all peace within
Fearing the freedom it never feels

Bounded by allegiance
To long gone sanity

It lurks deep below

Emerge at the last step

6. Violet Dawning
I am a part of the darkness
Used to watch from afar
Sensing the violence of morning
And breathing... And waiting for nothing
Devouring the spirit, grinding the heart
There are good things in the burning fields
There's peace in the slaughtered flesh
There's life in the frozen seeds

I'll dream in the deserts
And comfort the thirst for seeing
The violet dawn in the distance
Beckons me to steal its light

I'll wait for you here

I'll wait for you here

I'll wait for you here

I'll wait for you here

7. Return To Yggdrasil
A new sound heard throughout the land
From which the spirits had left ages ago
Sacrifice and honour replaced by betrayal and usurpers
A trail of sweat and blood, a gathering to the pagan
outer worlds

For ages we have wandered
Under the wings of deception
Too long have we been waiting
For the long winter to end

An uprising by those that claim the Supremacy of One
Against the misleaders of the blind, deceivers of the Masses
Man can no longer claim ignorance as reason for waiting
It is all for the taking, the world for their making

We will gather again
Under the leaves
We will gather again
In honour of the nine nights

For ages we have wandered
Under the wings of deception
Too long have we been waiting
For the long winter to end

We will gather again
To praise the courage
We will gather again
To watch the harvest

8. Secrets Of The Flesh
[instrumental]

9. Neogenesis
Navigation by the fires of dead worlds
Towards the shores of Neogenesis

Navigation by the fires of dead worlds
Towards the shores of Neogenesis

Distant self now cut through, approaching infinitely
Racing hearts throbbing deep beneath the painted bones
Mars opens the hidden doors to Venus
Lunar flight crashing into solar storms
Blinding unification - vertigo - ecstatic curtain fall
Get ablaze by inner arson, endlessly reborn
Winds, oh the winds that speak of your salt and blood
Break open the dam, flood the deserts

Shocking white pulsar radiant dreams drawn in night sky
Ice-glazed branches undead by rays from an impossible sun
Crystallized pathways towards runic chambers concealed within the microcosmos
Revert away from the predicament, flee across the abyss

Severing the fetal cords spawning fusions by the thousands
Through bent space created black channel - pagan relay
Sensations of flesh flickering
Praising death through bleeding eyes

Neogenesis

10. Outro: Communion (excerpt)

1. As Fire Swept Clean The Earth
[Music: Ivar Peersen - Lyrics: Ivar Peersen, Kjetil Grutle]

I close my eyes
As Fire Swept Clean the Earth
Nothing left to strangle
As the cords were torn from our hearts

"Tired I blew out my last warning, the claws were ripping me apart"

As we emerged
From darker dungeons
Splendor of yellow hells
Expanded swollen eyes

No words were said
As Fire Swept Clean the Earth
Would the mothers be crying?
If they saw torches in our hands?

"The wind, once able to conquer, captured As Fire Swept Clean the Earth"

A kiss was placed
Upon my cheek
And all color came back
Melting in solid blue tune

2. The Dead Stare
[Music: Ivar Peersen - Lyrics: Ivar Peersen, Per Arild Husebr]

The Juggler stares
To quench the thirst
Upon the brow
Within the hand
It cracks and seeps
The seer weeps

In flickering light
The wounds are served
Screams from below
A shadow in chains
Feverish images told
In mirrors of old

The eyes they all share
In this tragic court
An empty seat
The river runs dry
Nothing said
Words in red

Behold the druid
As the stones fall
Known aloud turned
Backwards around
Reverse the loss
This never was

3. The Crossing
[Music: Ivar Peersen - Lyrics: Kjetil Grutle]

I no longer struggle
No longer see
Nothing remains, burning anxiety
Darkness came forth
Gave birth to me
Certain death is all I see

I see you weep
I see you suffer
I've seen kingdoms rise and fall
I've seen all that's supposed to be

Earthbound forces, united with sorrow
The path was given in ancient times
Embraced by hunger, forgotten by will
The wisdom is hold up still

Break the chains, come forth to see
Cross the abyss not meant to be
Cross the river, find the key
Kill the queen of anxiety

4. Queen Of Night
[Music: Ivar Peersen - Lyrics: Ivar Peersen]

Across the scorched fields of fathers land
In each step an abyss is built
Through misty dreams he touched her hand
The boar is dead

Its blood is spilt

He set his foot on the slopes of far away
They'd been asleep when his sun roared
He walked through night, walked through day

Landless mourning lord

"Why should we let you by?"

The road is blocked by men of three

"If you need ask, you already know"

They said to let him pass, to leave him be

At the shores of sorrow
How far he'd come (to see her eyes)
(After) Moons and more moons
He'd be there tomorrow

"And I would travel across the water
To where she lies"

On the sea of solitude he rows
The winds howl her name, he has no fears

Tired and smiling he falls, downwards he goes
There she is, waiting after all these years

5. Havenless
[Music: Ivar Peersen - Lyrics: Ivar Peersen]
[* = excerpt from Norwegian author Aksel Sandemose, book "Vi pynter oss med horn"]

"Dei for ifra nord
Mot ei anna tid
Bak låg brende ord
Framfor dei ei ny strid

Dei såg såg stormar i det fjerne
Men haldt fram og beint
Inn mot jordas kjerne
Frå tidleg mot seint"

I see a darkness overwhelming
I see that there is no light for me
I don't care if it leaves me blind
I don't care if I'm left behind

I see a white horse's head
I see it's dead stare fixed at me
I do not fear its eyes
Curse myself, return it twice

I see walls to high to climb
I see nothing on the other side
I should have roamed another space
I should have been another place

*"Dei daue gror opp av havet og ropar så sårt mot land.
Dei ropar bak alle skuter, som kavar seg tungt forbi"

I am among ghosts when I should rest
I cannot tell the worlds apart
I do not heed the words they say
There is no dream of another day

I hear a silence, deafening
Drowning the deserts, that is my destiny
I no longer wish to see
The threads they've spun for me.

"Dei for ifra nord
Mot ei anna tid
Bak låg brende ord
Framfor dei ei ny strid

Dei såg såg stormar i det fjerne
Men haldt fram og beint
Inn mot jordas kjerne
Frå tidleg mot seint"

6. Ridicule Swarm
[Music: Ivar Peersen - Lyrics: Per Arild Husebr]

Pallid it hangs
In awe of amusement
Litany swarm
Bleak I say are the crutches of the assembly
And flies cling to it
More so ever the fingers to animate

Insubordinate, fickle exequies
Putrid core

Naudr........the ligature it can't break
Lagu...........the whispers it can't hear

Insubordinate, fickle exequies
Putrid core

"Er du halt kan du ri
Handlaus gjeta
Er du dauv kan du duga i strid
Blind er betre enn brend å vera
Daud mun ein lite duga"

Slain, and thoughts pour from the gutted mind.

"Ver kappi mot kristni
Ver kappi mot kross
Ver kappi mot Hvitrkristr
VER VANN
VER VANN
VER VANN"

"Er du halt kan du ri
Handlaus gjeta
Er du dauv kan du duga i strid
Blind er betre enn brend å vera
Daud mun ein lite duga"

NAUDR............

7. A Darker Place
[Music: Ivar Peersen - Lyrics: Ivar Peersen]

Behind the walls
Below the lights

If you came upon a door
If you came to push it open
If your eyes could see within this dark
Your heart would flee
Nails and blood
Painted by delirium
You would feel the empty stare

From a darker place

Silent screams
From ages in the void
Desperation
The voices fill your ears
Head back into the light
Never to return
This dream will haunt you

From a darker place

Behind the walls
Below the lights

ENSLAVED LYRICS


1. Entroper
I am the creator of true will

Long have I suffered
Long have I been forced
Blinded by their faith
Laughter resounds no more

I am the son of the ancient breed
I do not pity life
I follow not pathetic order
I am the realm of absurdity
Resistant to their conscience
Free of their constant pain
I was born in the flames

Long did they hope
That my logic would save them at last
Long did I know
That I would watch them die

While harvesting their fruits
Of their impotent threats
They forgot the potency
Of the old independency
Claiming my death would
Change the way of existence
Who, but me handled them?
The weapons of hope

They turned safely into non-existence

I will break the chains
I will slay the betrayers
One last time
The laughter shall resound

2. Path To Vanir
Awaiting my death, gasping for air
The relief emerge, the mistress so fair

Don't abandon me, please grant me life
I embrace your powers, higher wisdom's wife

I've been fighting in vain, but they grew too strong
For my kinsmen this day became far too long

I lie in the open, waiting to die
Were all my life's beauty built on a lie?

My grace you shall get, because I welcome your return
(If) you're not the hidden into sadness I'll turn
I've come to your rescue now before your last breath
My love you will receive, but it will be your death

Fear not, said the mistress, the lady of light
Those who betrayed us would not stand the fright

3. Fusion Of Sense And Earth
Cosmos trembled
When it came to be
Fusion of sense and earth

In awe they looked
Those who feared the dark
At the enemy of hate

All menaces vanished
Conquered by will to live
Marched towards the shores

A war against the abnormal
The obstacles of peace
Victory for the light

"Wisdom and Chaos must unite
The Storm Will Linger On"

When fighting blindfolded
Every beast was possible to slay
No fortress guarded

When the serpents
Spat at the surface of the earth
It howled and laughed

Armoured with good will
Certain of victory
It fell to the ground

"Wisdom and Chaos must unite
The Storm Will Linger On"

4. Ruun
Have you ever seen beyond the reach?
Have you ever felt the change?
Visions from an altered state
They conceal and relevate

Communing once again with Gods
Thread unto the impossible path
Talking with a different tongue
Heralding the unsung

Reach for them, see them turn away

Have you ever seen beyond the reach?
Have you ever felt the change?
Visions from an altered state
They conceal and relevate
Fly away, chains undone

Reach for them, see them turn away

Doors open wide
Step into the light
No turning back
Embrace the night
Breathe eternities
We are not alone
Never to return
Merge with the unknown

5. Tides Of Chaos
I've got this twisted core
I've got this noose around my neck
That (just) won't let go
I've got this dream
In Which I kill you all
And there is no going back
They've choked the good in me
Sent me off to wander alone
Hateful, starving enemy of (your) order
Hunt you down, make you understand
No compassion for the enslavers of will
Your spite for reason makes me strong
Your lack of direction showed me where to go
We've come to share this destiny
No borders, no landmarks
Out in the open
I hold the key to the door
In vivid dreams while awake
I saw a way through
The agony of choice

In a Universe where the storms rage Endlessly
Time will never come to reinstate me
Mine is none

There was a day when I knew silence
Then came the tides of chaos
Washed it all away
I have seen what you have become
Smiling with evil intent
Betrayal between the lines
I have stepped outside the circle
Better off without
Choking on sand and sorrow
Visions from the suffocated

In this Universe where the fire roars Endlessly
Peace will never come to reconstruct me
Mine is gone

6. Essence
The question is this
By will alone
Does my heart carry the strength
To see you burn?
When I do not wish to part
To see them farewell
Does my heart carry the strength
To leave you behind?

The eternal search for purity
A fragile hope for the just and fair
Order feeds from the corpses
All beauty must die

Where is the essence
In beast or scripture?
Where lies the laws
In stars or temples?
I cannot see myself
Not your orbit
I cannot see the others
Not your eyes

It lasts forever when you let it go
Purity and Pain

Where is the essence
In beast or scripture?
Where lies the laws
In stars or temples?
I cannot see myself
Not your orbit
I cannot see the others
Not your eyes

If I told you I'd get you through
I'd have to let you fall down

Not because of malice
You needed to
And I'll remember
What we had

It lasts forever when you let it go
Purity and Pain

7. Api-vat
You lie there sleeping
Growing in my mind
A voice from eternity
Awaken now and guide me

Awaken now and guide me
Awaken now and guide me

He turns inward to see
"What might lie ahead?"
Seeing all, but nowhere
"Tell us, will we see the sun again?"

"Waiting is the cost of true vengeance"

Carrying the weight of knowing
"I see darkness, I see evil times"
Time to rise and stand tall again
"The ideals of the One"
I bow to the forefathers
"Towards the Father"
Feeling the transition
"The unity of dimensions"

Leave me not before all fear is gone
Pour into my veins
Let the father become the son,
And I'll keep walking through every winter

I'll keep on walking through every winter
I'll keep on walking through every winter

8. Heir To The Cosmic Seed
Behold the great evening star
As she once again gives birth
Behold the great evening star
As she once again destroys

Behold the shining wife
Of all the howling winds
She arrives when you despair
Behold the shining wife

Beware of what the self desires
She could smile if she removed
All glory from kings

Beware of the heir of cosmic fertility
Her splendour can cut you deep
Her eyes can burn the fields.

1. Ethica Odini
Reckless man - So righteous, so clean
Towards the light - So bashful, so pure

Who told you to abandon life
Your strength, free will
And bow for the light?
The light! And turn from the spinning wheel

Fear of the judgement!
Obey!

[Ref:]
You have the key to mystery
Pick up the runes; unveil and see
Judgement comes, before us lie
The paths of war and you may die
You have the key, cross over and see
The old and wind-cold tree
Walk the steps and you'll hear the winds that cry

Search beyond the blinded eyes
Listen before you preach
Don't leave yourself behind

Honorlife, when life has ceased
Welcome the dawn

Beware the glory tales

Watch their deeds - So just and fair
Crusaders - Appointed by God

Who told you step inside and preach?
Did you forget the daggers lurking in the dark?
Couldn't you listen or didn't you ever learn how?
Were you saved?
Were you saved, so you could slaughter with grace?

[Ref:]
You have the key to mystery
Pick up the runes; unveil and see
Judgement comes, before us lie
The paths of war and you may die
You have the key, cross over and see
The old and wind-cold tree
Walk the steps and you'll hear the winds that cry

Search beyond the blinded eyes
Listen before you preach
Don't leave yourself behind

Honorlife, when life has ceased
Welcome the dawn

Beware the glory tales

Hold on, don't fade away
Don't be afraid to bleed
Don't be afraid to dream

Let the elders enlighten the path
They have cried for you
They have died for you

Drasill - Ride on
Drasill - Ride on
Ride on
Drasill

2. Raidho
This journey without movement
Heading out for no-man's land
The way ahead my only ally
Early hours, in the silence

This credence keeps me upright
Through the storms and disasters
A straight line towards the unknown end
Deceit waits on the back roads

This unwavering inner
Keeps fear a welcomed pointer
I, uprooted, now the fertile soil
As plot and shadows thicken

This juggernaut cannot be stopped
On any scale or planet
Ghostly tracks in my wake and ahead
An experience, cannot be shared

[Ref:]
Wheels of time
Keep them turning
Carriage of concepts
Circling the planes

Lightless voyage, blinding speeds
Certain; I'll stay the distance
Abstract shapes, enigmatic design
I know enough to endure

Lightless corridors, ageless
Familiar
Alien
Contradictory engines run high
Deeper and further above

Journey of no promises
Beyond the lust for rewards
Focus on the movement of the Wheel
Union of stillness and change

Journey of the ages all
I'll follow outside the edge
Breath, blood, sacrifice and bleeding eyes
Unending journey ahead

[Ref:]
Wheels of time
Keep them turning
Carriage of concepts
Circling the planes

3. Waruun
See them as they rise
From ancient sands - constructs
They're reaching everywhere and nowhere
As they're trampling on the archetypes
The listener warns

Tension... Pain... Fear... Violence

It reaches the limit set by
Ageless reason
Tension paints logic's hunts
Pain dances... (with justice)

Lies for the liar served without remorse
Like the gifts bring gifts
Altering view

Constant truth - drained of spirit
By own will

[Ref:]
Waruun
Waruun - Drawn in the dust of morning
Waruun - The violence of the soul

Suicides upon the altars
Of evasion

Feared dissonance kept away - nails on stone
As darkness descends
Can't find our way out of here
Yet... It was built by you
Words on the trap-door

[Ref.:]
Waruun
Waruun - Drawn in the dust of morning
Waruun - The violence of the soul

Tension... Pain... Fear... Violence

How could freedom become the cage-maker?
What spoke to the mind-slayer?

4. The Beacon
To war!
Let the havoc be revenged

March!

Against the lords of perdition

Live!
Breathe!

Persecute the ones that left to persecute your soul
Crush the scepters of the kings and come and
Hail the vows of old!

[Ref:]
Hear them cry
Watch them fly
Let them bow to the altars of suppression
Till you'll feel them die

Hear them cry
Watch them fly
The power and the free will they deny

Beyond the mist
Far above
On the highest peak
The beacon is lit
On the highest peak
The beacon will burn

How did I get this far?
How did it come to this?
Was my blood spilt in vain?
Did I survive, did I break the chains?
Was I ever alive?

Struggle through the wounds
Struggle through the fears
Struggle through the truths
You stand alone

Come through!
Release me!

[Ref:]
Hear them cry
Watch them fly
Let them bow to the altars of suppression
Till you'll feel them die

Hear them cry
Watch them fly
The power and the free will they deny

Beyond the mist
Far above
On the highest peak
The beacon is lit
On the highest peak
The beacon will burn

I walked this far myself
My blood dripped from my knife
I awoke, and was alive
I did no longer weep
I saw my beacon, I ran to aid

5. Axioma
"Mind not the worshippers of punishment,
Un-growers and resisters"

Close your eyes, sense the below
Torment and separation points ahead
Set ablaze like steel through skin

"Fear not the settlement with those who fear the truth"

Leave now, bid farewell with no grief
Their words have no power
The forces will roam and return

6. Giants
No distance, no time
Endless void, absence of life
Chaos dwells outside the womb
Seduce, Invoke
Embrace, Give birth

See through the flesh
See past the soul
Feel the pulsating twilight
Domain of unborn thoughts
Go back, Unveil
Approach the cosmic womb

No smile without pain
No grief without laughter

[Ref.:]
Turn inwards, Realize
Witness the march of the Giants
-Soil and seed
Turn inwards, Gratify
Witness the storming of heaven
-Endless rebirth

Come nearer, Restless sin
Step into the core
They will welcome your return
Further in
Ride the storm one can't escape

Awake the Gods
Awake the Gods

[Ref.:]
Turn inwards, Realize
Witness the march of the Giants
-Soil and seed
Turn inwards, Gratify
Witness the storming of heaven
-Endless rebirth

7. Singular
Born into oblivion
Without the fear
-of existing all alone

Later comes the acquisition - forced upon
The solitude
Now loneliness
The god now submerged in a game of guilt

Psychopathic shepherds deny the miracle
-of our essence
...And yet we have part in the blame

Allowing their ravings,
Comforting their weakness, their sickness
It is time to
LIVE
TRUST
NO
ONE

Recognize black
Recognize white
Recognize shadows
I am with gods

...Black...White...Shadows...Gods

Recognize black
Recognize white
Recognize shadows
I am with gods

Traitors want to keep you down
Rise up from the ground

No-one steals what no-one owns
Disown and distance

Strong is she who realizes
Ethics built on sacrifice

No-one steals what no-one owns

One by one by one

Strong is she who realizes
Ethics built on sacrifice

No need for companionship
Back into the silence
It is all it needs
Desolation

Singular - Death - Birth
Singular - Birth - Death

Alone in birth
Alone in the darkness
Alone in death
Alone in the daylight

One with reality
Shaped by the inner glow
Determination - I
All can be reached from within

Born into oblivion
Without the fear
-of existing all alone

Later comes the acquisition - forced upon
The solitude
Now loneliness
The god now submerged in a game of guilt

Psychopathic shepherds deny the miracle
-of our essence
...And yet we have part in the blame

Allowing their ravings,
Comforting their weakness, their sickness
It is time to
LIVE
TRUST
NO

Recognize black
Recognize white

8. Night-sight
I can see through the veil
Seeing all I need see
Nothing is hidden here
Deep into the woods

Casting
Letters that speak of...
All
Is all
Is naught

No-one but me
Knows of this place
Sanctuary
Where I construct

Dream while there is no strife
Anguish pulls no weight
One can see and the other is blind
Through the same pair of eyes

We have lost sight
Of the night-side of the self
Hunted by the fear
Of reunion
Night-sight is bliss
For he who dares look into
A world where you embrace the opposite
Where you are whole

There is no lasting joy
In numbness and dogma
Too much is too little in knowledge
Driven by mystery

We have lost sight
Of the night-side of the self
Hunted by the fear
Of reunion
Night-sight is bliss
For he who dares look into
A world where you embrace the opposite
Where you are whole

9. Lightening
I crossed the borders
The pain won't go away

For this treason, I want to see them ... Burn!
Hunt them down
Make them understand
The power I possess

I'll give you piece of mind
And freedom to search inside

I'll suffer for your souls

I cleaned the air
I slew death in your way
The hand of peace
All evil's great dismay

Hear the wheels turn
See the sky burns

For this treason, I want to see them... Burn!
Track them down
Bring them to silence
My will is the law

I'll bring you life and growth
And erase the memories of despair

I'll suffer for your needs

Don't you forget where your domain lies
Obey your slaves, with their feeble cries
We'll force you back if you linger here
We mock your strength, we see your fear
You'll never set a slave's mind free
Your bane is the grip of anxiety

At the ninth...

REID - Travel with no fear
REID - Remember to return
REID - Defy the laughing chaos
REID - Strike again

You fight the wars for your kin
You leave yourself behind
This settlement, you can't win
The inner eye is blind

I will clean the air
I know the pain will stay
I'll cross the border
I'll never fade away

For this treason, I want to see them... Burn!
Track them down
Bring them to silence
My will is the law

I'll bring you life and growth
And erase the memories of despair

I will linger on

ENSLAVED LYRICS


1. Clouds
In the void of chaos life endures
In the gap of creation, the ancient wisdom breathes

Inheritance of fire
Inheritance of frost
Yet it lay there weeping
Afraid to see the light

Inheritance of fire
Inheritance of frost
No one comes to unveil
No one finds the key

Inheritance of fire
Inheritance of frost
Grasp the mighty chaos
Grasp the ancient birth

Seek deep within, feel the flames
Into the void, never to return
Seek deep within, fertilize
Into the void, rise...

Struggling against the fumes
Poisoning the hearts
Fighting the chains, to penetrate the clouds
Pulsating life in the ancient womb
Encapsulated in forces of old

Waiting to hear the call
To witness the cosmic marriage
Willing to blow; to blow the mocking clouds away

2. To The Coast
To the coast, but not across
Static sanctuary

Longing for the heart of the changer
Chained to the past, a dream of liberation
The vultures above, they know, they've seen him linger here
Where the barren land meets sea; the mother and the reaper
The irony of...
Sorrow kept close
Hanging head
Gaze upon the waters and turn back again
Like so many times before

Riders on the horizon with darkness in tow

Too painful to let go of the fear, too strong the ties
He came without a face
...And a promise of belonging
So I caved and gave way to this vision
Bleak and never-ending the pages
I'd like to see what lies beyond
Dissolving ink in salt water
Wrecked and laughing at the skies and the open sea

To the coast but not across
Had some strange days then walked back
To the coast but not across

Longing for the heart of the changer
Chained to the past, a dream of liberation
The vultures above, they know, they've seen him linger here
Where the barren land meets the sea; the mother and the reaper
The irony of...

Riders on the horizon with darkness in tow

Too painful to let go of the fear, too strong the ties
He came without a face
...And a promise of belonging
So I caved and gave way to this vision
Bleak and never-ending the pages
I'd like to see what lies beyond
Dissolving ink in salt water
Wrecked and laughing at the skies and the open sea

Black clad back into the all over again

3. Ground
The defining sound

Fangs into flesh
Panic and spit
Death unto life
Eyes wide

It sees itself through the layers of ice
Now; seal the cracks ... reject the notions!
Everything can not be happening on the inside?

An option not to listen

A nameless urge takes hold
Prey upon the weak
An aimless tale told
Pray upon the weak

Caught in a spiral of need
Act without the choice
Choose not to act
Caught in a spiral of need

Desperate and alone in a whole
Striving for higher ground
Carrying someone else's fears for tomorrow
Stay behind the line
Or eat from the bowels of reality
Grind the thorns to stardust
Gliding slowly across the abyss
Inside the inside the inside

There is a sound made by boiling blood

Above and below lay the levels
Above and below the ground
Ground

4. Vertebrae
"Abandoning the powers that gave them sight
Summoned to the altars of their loving gods"

Storming the walls, once built with pride
Swarming like rats away from the lights
Howling for justice, death in their eyes
Tearing down the pillars with monstrous hate

Forging the swords to slay their own kin
Screaming in triumph, burning inside

When the steps are fulfilled
We shall see a new dawn
When the dead world is gone
We shall rebuild the walls

When all the bricks from the morning
When they are once again found
We will emerge from the ashes
And rise from the ground

5. New Dawn
In the radiant night
Beneath the fertile soil
In every heart it lies sleeping
Hiding in dreams of strength
Older than the mountains
So ancient and profound
Beyond the grasp of reason
Above the laws of man

The ancient gods of battle
Summoned by the drums of war
In circles of fire descended
Our eyes and minds frantic
At the point of no return
I never saw her shine so bright
Returning the strength to a weary heart
Strife to reclaim and expand

A new dawn rises
Out from the shadows
A new dawn rises
I step unto the world

In times when truth has lost its valour
In times when fate is bought and sold
When honour lays slain at vanity's feet
It seemed like our last hour had come
The enemies' name outspoken
They will tremble upon seeing the sign
The second coming has no mercy
Forged in the flames with iron will

A new dawn rises
Out from the shadows
A new dawn rises
I step unto the world

6. Reflection
Clinging to life in the reflection of the self
Breathing the air from the poisoned pit
Hovering through flames from the burning core

Searching for reason in the ashes of men
Obeying the laws of the kings without lands
Bowing in awe at the hypocrite's feet
Not hearing the cry of the infant

Poisoning the seed that was planted within
Ignoring the winter that closes in
Believing the tales from the forked tongue
Frozen to death without being born

Looking for reason in the bottomless abyss

Clinging to life in the reflection of the self
Breathing the air from the poisoned pit
Hovering through flames from the burning core

Searching for reason in the ashes of men
Obeying the laws of the kings without lands
Bowing in awe at the hypocrite's feet

Clinging to life
Frozen to death

Clinging to life in the reflection of the self
Frozen to death without being born

Absorbing the reek of rotting Flesh
Marching in convoys to fields unknown

Clinging to life in the reflection of the self
Embracing the sun without casting shadows

Believing the tales from the forked tongue
Frozen to death without being born.

7. Center
Feel nothing
Oxen and primate as one
Pushing what already strives
(There is) no space
(There is) no peace
Let go of the whip

We've reached the outer limits of this orchestrated vision
Some might think it can't be kept apart
Forgot to ask: where are we in all of this?
Trying to get off track ... Into the wilderness
Running from the beast

In need of strength, in search of guidance
Asked but given nothing - remembering everything
It matters not now, it all came to fuel
Silent growth
Hoarse rust
Can not be broken
I trust the shapes
Heathen vertigo
Repaint the curses and bellow
Sailing past to old shores
In the distant haze

The waving motion
Is not for you

In every direction stretched and torn no more
(It) seems we've been here all along

8. The Watcher
Darkness...
Fear...
Life...
Cold...

Left alone with no will
Walking in footsteps of the fallen
Blinded by lack of reason
Indulging the tales of doom

...Farewell,
May the darkness bind them
No one will
Remember the pain when we are...

Desolate...
Unconscious...
Lost...

Where lays the ones I've slain?
Did I become any wiser?
Will their anger hunt me down?
Did I sacrifice in vain?

...Farewell,
Hear the sound of solitude
No one will
Walk the bridge, to darkness overcome

Settlement...
Trust...
Relief...
Dawn...

Guide me, watcher in the skies
Transform the forces of the dead
In my dreams I'll hunt them down

1. Disintegrator
Separate
The frenzied infant
From mother
Her bosom bleeding
She needs sleep

Separate
The frenzied infant
From his mother
Her bosom bleeding
She needs sleep

Take him to the woods
Leave him there
The dogs will feast
The dogs will know him

Disintegrate
Disintegrate
Disintegrate
Disintegrate

2. Striker
From soar to plague
From clouds to imprisonment
From wheat to the gallows
In dreams of free will
Strike

Never saw fields
Quite like these
Never will Never would
With open eyes
Shut

Useless wreckage
In the wake
Cannot hear the chatter
Cannot bear the drag
Leave

When they saw
With what they were left
They screamed in fear
They screamed for blood
Endure

Should I build
I will build my own
Knife and noose
In flesh and will
Strike

ENSLAVED LYRICS


1. Thoughts Like Hammers
Celestial buried mind resting
Resting without peace still
Don't know where I drowned

Cornered and defeated
Yes, there's a thought forming
Patterns in the currents
Mud-dwellers at the star-floor

Nourishment for the mind seeps
Harvest through suffering
Absorbed in desperation

Assimilated logic
Drawn towards the ladders
Elucidated, burned, afraid
Instinctive destruction sparked
Elucidated, burned, afraid
Knowing only my own dissent
Elucidated, burned, afraid
Static is the common language
Elucidated, burned, afraid

Celestial buried mind resting
Resting without peace still

Assimilated logic
Drawn towards the ladders
Elucidated, burned, afraid
Instinctive destruction sparked
Elucidated, burned, afraid
Knowing only my own dissent
Elucidated, burned, afraid
Static is the common language
Elucidated, burned, afraid

Motion remains our mothertongue
Failure might not be what it seems
All is broken for a reason
Familiar blood drawn for painting
Willing another perspective
Flashing scenes seeing children above

Knowing there will be another life
Sacrificing
Sacrificing remnants of the past
Walking all on my own forever
The illusion no longer needed

It is spoken without words of doubt
Now we move the stars above, below

And dwell beneath the layers of dirt
My runic patterns in the current

My runic patterns in the current

Motion remains our mothertongue
Failure might not be what it seems
All is broken for a reason
Familiar blood drawn for painting
Willing another perspective
Flashing scenes seeing children above

2. Death In The Eyes Of Dawn
The creation I can't remember
Unsecure I roam in fear
The final steps I've taken
What waits beyond this void?

"I sucked out your lifeblood
Tore down your fortress
Burned down the woods
I poisoned your harvest"

Trust and hope
I have lost
I see death
In the eyes of dawn
Deceit
Forged in the darkened depths of the womb
Seeds of betrayal planted in rotten soil

The ground swells
It's the end
I see the face
Of the dead god
Legions of the dead
Invading our realm
Forever deaf to the distant warning

Blinded are my eyes
Tied are my hands
Sleeping wide awake
Got lost within myself

I followed all the paths
Rigtheous in my heart
Slept without the dreams
Got lost within myself

When will I remember?
When will I hear the call?
When shall my forces gather?
When shall my battle begin?

"I've insulted your life since birth
You have never seen my true face
You failed to realize I'm your kin
I infected your mind when you smiled"

Awake!

The grip of anxiety
Shall strangle the brave no more

The son of earth and wind
Shall guide us in our wake

"You might hear the horn resound
You might summon back your king
As long as you love, I will hate
As long as you breed, I will kill"

Blinded are my eyes
Tied are my hands
Sleeping wide awake
Got lost within myself

I followed all the paths
Rigtheous in my heart
Slept without the dreams
Got lost within myself

3. Veilburner
Finding the truth doesn’t mean there’s an answer
Who would have thought? It seems worthless.
There’s no end to the travesty, idiocy,
It would seem I’ve arrived at the meeting point
Between then and now, a different place
The past alive, and the future is now

I can not tolerate being held in the dark
I need to see, I will the flames
Expanding light, from within a cube of darkness
I need to see, I will the flames
I found myself crawling, looking for an “out”
And made the gap no longer closed anymore
’cause my signs are burning, burning the veil
Killing our idols, scaring ourselves as well
Necessity, carer/killer
We’re all gonna see, we weren’t prepared

I can not tolerate being held in the dark
I need to see, I will the flames
Expanding light, from within a cube of darkness
I need to see, I will the flames
I found myself crawling, looking for an “out”
And made the gap no longer closed anymore
’cause my signs are burning, burning the veil
Killing our idols, scaring ourselves as well
Necessity, carer/killer
We’re all gonna see, we weren’t prepared

Grasping the liquid glass
Shaping my own sight
Staring at the sun
Absorbing death
Reach into the well
Where father laid his eye

4. Roots Of The Mountain
Approaching life
From the seeds of time
Cosmic pulse
Aeons of chaos

Feel the flames, the streams of life below
Feel the flames, that blind your inner eye
Seek and find, what lingers deep inside
Seek and find, but do not try to understand
Spread the wings, and fly into your mind
Spread the wings, and find the eagle in the sky
Find the source, the ancient passion play
Find the source, the roots of the mountain

Hark, men of faith
Where were you
When your children bled to death?
Listen, men of law
Where were you when the mothers were slain?

Feel the flames, the streams of life below
Feel the flames, that blind your inner eye
Seek and find, what lingers deep inside
Seek and find, but do not try to understand

Hark, men of faith
When you set fire to the fields,
The grass grew stronger
Listen, men of law
When you turned from life,
The flames endured
Leave order, the fiend of the earth
The self is all you've got
Enter life on the waves from the void
Behold the ancient roots
And the battles shall forever go on
With peace comes our certain doom
The mother will love as she hates
Where there is life, you will die

Approaching life
Aeons of chaos
Feel the flames, the streams of life below
Feel the flames, that blind your inner eye
Seek and find, what lingers deep inside
Seek and find, but do not try to understand
Spread the wings, and fly into your mind
Spread the wings, and find the eagle in the sky
Find the source, the ancient passion play
Find the source, the roots of the mountain

5. RIITIIR
Your arms, life and death
Ride the chariot, the wheel of life
Underneath the eyes we pray

Seven horses running in circles until the end of days
Above the wonders of man, sailing the cosmic seas
Risen from the darkness to rule the ancient world
Never to return, the eyes will forever shine on

Omniscient, glorious - the all seeing eye
Malign, burning grace
All rise! The seeds you will bring
Sons of man, bow in awe

Omnipotent, Lumina Titan
In the havens you greeted us
Late is the hour you submerge
Endless travel towards the dawn

Hail the flames inside you, cosmic flowers in bloom
Hail the spears impaling, the servants of doom
Given are the truths, together we shall search
Unveiling the riddles, hidden beneath the stones

Left is an ancient entity
Ready to sacrifice, what we may (have) achieved
Ending a journey with no end

Defying the ones drowned in salvation
Letting the forces roam free
A circle fulfilled

6. Materal
See her cruel beauty
Hostile to the constants
Ever changing scourge
Ashen thrones
Converge upon me
Come winds of destruction
Electrocute the stale
Purify

Thaw! False ice to water
Speak! Sharp tongues sever sick limbs
Numb! Do not look away
Opt! Permanent particles

Curtains be unshut
Old wounds opened and bled
Wishes laid to rest
Ashen hopes
Reflections of truth
Drops of eternity
Instances captured
Clarify

Etch! New shapes will emerge
Need! Reaching into the dark
Owe! I opened the gates
Roar! O', devourer of time

There's this chamber
Randomly placed in time and space
Echo chamber
Achievable dream
Capacitate
Heuristic observers might find
Ends to the means
Rain is less scarce there

You heeded my call - now read my signs
And chose to follow
Dominate slavelessly
Enter my thoughts,
And walk with me throughout these barren lands
Aligning wordlessly
Tell me my own story,
Through the inner and nether worlds
Healing accordingly
Into the night side, irreversible and remorseless
Slaughterous and reborn
Hagalaz!

End the charade!
Return to the wombs
A funeral lost
Baptize the faceless
Light up the beacons
End the hunt for truth!
Time to break it down
Owe nothing to trees
Nullify the past

Enter the maternal fires
Entropy
Deter rot within the roots
Nourisher
Old fears no longer controls
Negation
Enter maternal fires
Xiphoid dreams

I close the gate!
Silence the voices
Take to heart the fear
And nourish the pain
Nothing can hurt us
Called upon the mare
Ended the sham reign
These forces in tow
Endlessness opens

Ashen memories
Retain the images
In need of her strength
Time changes
Death is encountered
Over and over again
Worship her pyres
Navigate

7. Storm Of Memories
In the land described as the beyond
In lack of better directional insight
Something stirs and leaps
Casual roads of reason intersect
Conceptual wormholes in the lawless black
In ancient matter

Unknown kin, as they thoroughfare
Unexplored utopia lineage
Accumulation
Icebergs of the abyss never melts
Ideal energy, it's building within
Unlike loyalty

Cadaverous and spirited; I work
Composite and uniform; I sacrifice
Resist the wisdom
With limited perception we see
We learn, and we laugh, and we sleep,
And we watch
Logic is worthless

Storm of the ions, ecstatic mind
Seeps through the cracks, it fills up the bones
I remember now
The here and the now - it is nothing
...This Eve - haunted by a storm of memories
Immortality

Then it was quiet, then it was dark
Trees, dreams, and the runes
Makes for a future
I'm on the inside
Looking at the sky, I think of you
Life is a room, in between the greater halls
There we'll met again

I can't make out what is what is what
In this storm of memories
Now it all comes back
I know there's strength in my blood
I can hear the past
Fearing not
Time has come... listen
There's a storm
Within
Storm of the ions, ecstatic mind
Seeps through the cracks, it fills up the bones
I remember now
The here and the now - it is nothing
...This Eve - haunted by a storm of memories
Immortality

Then it was quiet, then it was dark
Trees, dreams, and the runes
Makes for a future
I'm on the inside
Looking at the sky, I think of you
Life is a room, in between the greater halls
There we'll met again

Unknown kin, as they thoroughfare
Unexplored utopia lineage
Accumulation
Icebergs of the abyss never melts
Ideal energy, it's building within
Unlike loyalty

Cadaverous and spirited; I work
Composite and uniform; I sacrifice
Resist the wisdom
With limited perception we see
We learn, and we laugh, and we sleep,
And we watch
Logic is worthless

8. Forsaken
Forsaken
Entombed in monumental self-moral
Embracing the absurd
Reason turned to abstraction
Drowned in the shallowest of waters

Forgotten the will
To learn
Abandoned every urge to
Create
Every border can be breached
By the glorious armies of united perfection

Marching forth
Aiming low
A thirst to kill
Defending the nothingness

Forsaken
The unborn learns to hate
Navigation towards destruction
Letting our ideals slowly rot

And thus...
Thus we choose
To die...
Die with pride
And innocence...

We became the heralds
Born and raised to preach
And to erase all traces
Of the abstract and evil

Swords...
Temples...
Fires...
Doom...
We failed to see what we fed
The serpent of the deeps
It grew and strangled the truths
We were embracing the lies
We once could see its eyes
The stare of death and deceit
We feared not, the secrets we knew
The guardian of the deeps

Lost...
And the darkness will prevail
Forever...
Folding hands with clouded sight
Ceremonial rituals will obscure the mind
Forever...

Lost...
And turning blossom to decay
Forever...
Fighting wars with clouded sight
Ceremonial rituals will obscure the mind
Forever...

ENSLAVED LYRICS


1. One Thousand Years of Rain
[performed by Enslaved]The age of the wolf is the age of the sword

Son of the earth, father of despair, lurking
And ever searching to end his thirst
Strength reborn in the streams of cold blood
Son of the earth, father of rage, hiding beneath
And ever smiling when the seed is planted
Hate paving the streets of gold

Long gone is the golden grace
Feeble beats from a frozen heart
Now glowing eyes in the pale face
The blind man cries in vain
Long gone is the light of day
Searching the borders of sanity
The children of tomorrow they slay
Their spirits entombed in rotten soil

Son of the earth, father of anxiety, amongst us
And ever telling the tales of the righteous
Licking drops of sorrow from the lake of tears
Son of the earth, father of treason, envy the beauty
And ever embracing the desperation
Hiding from the moonbeams, afraid to face the wrath
Wandering down the icy path
The sun is dying
The mother is crying
No sadness found in the jester’s face
The sun is dying
The mother is crying

Long gone is the golden grace
Feeble beats from a frozen heart
Now glowing eyes in the pale face
The blind man cries in vain
Long gone is the light of day
Searching the borders of sanity
The children of tomorrow they slay
Their spirits entombed in rotten soil

The winter is closing in
Like the grip of a war within
Absence of light turning flesh to stone
A cosmic war and you stand alone

Brother killing brother
Tales of honor becoming myth
History written with axes and blood
The wolf is howling at the gate

Bræðr munu berjask
(Ok at) bönum verðask,
Munu systrungar
Sifjum spilla
Leika Míms synir
(En) mjötuðr kyndisk
At inu galla Gjallarhorni

Skelfr Yggdrasils
Askr standandi
Ymr it aldna tré
Hræðask allir
(Á helvegum)
(Áðr Surtar þann
Sefi of gleypir

Wandering down the icy path
The sun is dying
Silent tears won’t bring him back
No sadness found in the jester’s face
The mother is crying
Breach the walls, relieve the pain, or be left in one thousand years of rain

2. Ægirs armar
[performed by Enslaved]
3. Immigrant Song
[performed by Enslaved]
[originally by Led Zeppelin]Ahhh-ah-ah! Ahhh-ah-ah!

We come from the land of the ice and snow
From the midnight sun where the hot springs blow
Hammer of the gods will drive our ships to new lands
To fight the horde and sing and cry
Valhalla, I am coming

On we sweep with the threshing oar
Our only goal will be the western shore

Ahhh-ah-ah! Ahhh-ah-ah!

We come from the land of the ice and snow
From the midnight sun where the hot springs blow
How soft your fields so green can whisper tales of gore
Of how we calmed the tides of war
We are your overlords

On we sweep with the threshing oar
Our only goal will be the western shore

So now you'd better stop and rebuild all your ruins
For peace and trust can win the day despite of all your losing

Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh

Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh

ENSLAVED LYRICS


1. Ulvaskall (Vargr)
I've been losing - All my life
Been misused - Endless trife
Raging fury - Lonely soul
Foreboding warning - Never whole

I'm cursed and I'm damned forever
Destined to walk this land
I'm cursed and I'm damned forever
Battle is my only friend

Blood stained morning - Darkened skies
Still that longing - No more lies
Raging fury - Lonely soul
Foreboding warning - Never whole

I'm cursed and I'm damned forever
Destined to walk this land
I'm cursed and I'm damned forever
Battle is my only friend
Neither wolf nor man

2. Summer Solstice
At the summer solstice you and I will gather round the strong
We'll drink a toast from the cup of blood and realize the truth
Come on now let's see what we can find beyond the stars
Release your soul and tear apart the chains of you heavy load

Fire -Magick
We will find our peace of mind
Fire - Magick
We'll leave this tired world behind

At the summer solstice we will make a bond so strong and true
Hates bodies swirling 'round the golden ripened corn
Come on now let the sacrifice but for all who know
That the Sun and Moon still rule our lives today and evermore

Fire -Magick
We will find our peace of mind
Fire - Magick
We'll leave this tired world behind

3. Brotherhood Of Sleep
Returning from the exile with their message clear
Keepers of a secret shadow things are near
They only offer you and me eternal life
Look within my friend 'cause it's time to decide

Live, are you gonna live or die
Die, time for you to decide

The root of knowledge lies
Within the wormwood's tale
Another sip will bring you truth to crystal clear
Sacred ritual will illuminate
Look within my friend and embrace your fate

Sleep
Dream
What's your choice?
You have no choice!
Sleep
Dream
What's your choice?
Brotherhood of Sleep

4. Baptised In Fire
In a cavern- Of deep despair
All alone- surrounded by stone

The serpent's poison - Searing the skin
A flicker of light - The pyre grows bright

He took the revenge
He fed the flame
Forever in rapture
Forever reign

Baptised in fire
Born within the flame

Thoughts so hollow - Take on a new meaning
His mission apprears - No longer be hallow, my son

Black cauldron boils - Taste the brew
No more lying - Fire, the guiding light

He took the revenge
He fed the flame
Forever in rapture
Forever reign

Baptised in fire
Born within the flame

5. Chooser Of The Slain (Valfader)
Marked by death, still living - Never giving in
Future paths uncertain - Fighting till the end

You can betray me
The pain won't break me
Here I stand - I'll never crawl

WarGlad will take me
No mourning on my dying day
Let me burn and enter the hall

Harness arcane power - Oaths with hidden goals
Never beg forgiveness - Death, end and beginning

You can betray me
The pain won't break me
Here I stand - I'll never crawl

WarGlad will take me
No mourning on my dying day
Let me burn and enter the hall

6. Food Of The Gods
Still searching for a meaning
A search that will be in vain
Disquised and denial
Your crippled life will end in pain

Bolt of lightning
Striking you down
The price of lying
Eternal flame

Now in ever mounting terror
You pay the dues of your betrayal
Vengeance's soaring high now
Nowhere to hide no one is spared

Crushing power
Boiling blood
The call of thunder
Grim sacrifice

Rain coming down
Chaos all around
You will all be devoured alive
You've become
The food of the Gods

Sail!

7. He Who Seeks Shall Find
Now aligned - Three signs of fire
No longer blind - Or choked by liars

I've been redeemed
My eyes can see

Fear and doubt - Just passing feelings
Time has come - To speak of healing
Crush the walls - And killl denial
One must try - It's no illusion

He who seeks - shall find
He who seeks - never blind

GRAND MAGUS LYRICS


1. Gauntlet
Black star in sight
Giving my life
Living to fight
Giving my life

Steel crown my goal
Claiming the throne
Burning their eyes
Laugh with delight

Black star in sight
Giving my life
Living to fight
Giving my life
Life
Life

2. Legion
A mighty blast of fire burned across the sky
It is no unknown power causing this tonight
They didn't know I had it in me but I have returned
Transformed, no longer human, watch the heavens burn

You'll pay

They hear the hooves thundering, raising up a storm
He comes with vengeance seething, breaking up the calm
Been called a traitor and a fool so many times
From now on all apposing men will fear the sign

Twisting, turning, riding across the plain
Creating a river of blood, bringer of pain
The god of war, destroyer of all in his reign
Legion's the name called by the toll of bell

Been called a traitor and a fool so many times
From now on all apposing men will fear the sign

Twisting, turning, riding across the plain
Creating a river of blood, bringer of pain
The god of war, destroyer of all in his reign
Legion's the name called by the toll of bell

3. Never Learned
I have been told
Why I can't grow old
I never learned
To stay away
When the water churns

Alright

I can't be sold
No matter what your gold
I, oh I
I've never learned
I never learned
I've never learned
Never learned
I never learned

Cause I never learned
I never learned
Never learned
I never learned
Cause I never learned

4. Black Hound Of Vengeance
Got firm belief in what's to come
Your treacherous ways leave me cold and numb
No magic circle will save you now
Your scent's been picked up by my wish to strike

You try to hide behind a veil of smoke
To summon petty demons, will not work
Cause my familiar has searched you out
To make you pay for all the pain I took

You'll learn the way of -
The Black Hound Of Vengeance
You'll learn the way of -
The Black Hound Of Vengeance

You'll learn the way of -
The Black Hound Of Vengeance
You'll learn the way of -
The Black Hound Of Vengeance

You'll learn the way of -
The Black Hound Of Vengeance
You'll learn the way of -
The Black Hound Of Vengeance

5. Coat Of Arms
A glade became the setting
Must have been about noon
Grass so green and tender
Ripped apart by steel clad boots

Mid-day's sun reflected
In weapons sharp as steel
Grim determination
One shall die and one shall live

And the dawn became the winner
Sun and moon will rise again
Coat of arms shine and shimmer
A king has been crowned

Now the wounds are open
Blood engulfing all
Ready for the gauntlet
One will stand and one will fall

And the dawn became the winner
Sun and moon will rise again
Coat of arms shine and shimmer
A king has been crowned

And the dawn became the winner
Sun and moon will rise again
Coat of arms shine and shimmer
A king has been crowned

Alright

6. Generator
Like a lead-heavy generator
Just pushing everything aside
I took my pill and now I feel alright

Like a wheel dead-set on moving
Perpetual bliss in sight
I took my fill and now I feel alright

Oh yeah, I feel alright
Believe me I feel just fine
Oh yeah, I feel alright

Got no restraining shackles
Just a highway stretching far and wide
The sun shines down and feeds me with what I need

There ain't nobody waiting
I'm free to do whatever I please
I've flipped the coin and now I will be seen

Yeah, I will be seen
I'm coming out, I'm coming clean
Oh yeah I will be seen
I will be mean
Emerald, emerald eyes rising from the tomb
No, no quarter in sight, generator of light

Emerald, emerald eyes rising from the tomb
No, no quarter in sight, now you meet your doom
Emerald, emerald eyes prepare for your undoing
No, no quarter in sight, generator of light

Oh come on
Yeah

7. Wheel Of Time
Wheel of time rotating ever onward
Nothing new and nothing has been learned
The same mistakes still repeated every time
A pleasant ignorance rules the crooked line

Stand back and face your terrible fate
Your soul has been circumscribed
And your body will just wither away

Time to wake from your non-creative slumber
Seasons change but still you stay the same
A crushing blow's going to force your decision
You realize that there is no prize for you

Stand back and face your terrible fate
Your soul has been circumscribed
And your body will wither away

Roll on, wheel of time
Roll on, just crush and grind
Roll on, wheel of time
Roll on, wheel of time!
Yeah

Roll on, wheel of time
Roll on, just crush and grind
Roll on, wheel of time
Roll on, wheel of time!

8. Lodbrok
Sacrifice
The only way to be sure
To rid the land
Of the plague that's been haunting us all
Restoring our faith
In the axe and the sword

Slaves for so long
Our minds filled up with their lies
Now the Christian cross
Forever erased from our eyes

Rejoice all free men
Betrayer, run if you can

Rejoice all free men
Betrayer, run if you can

Run if you can
Run if you can
Run if you can
RUN IF YOU CAN

9. Black Hole
All that I want, give me just what I need
What I've been told ain't exactly what I've seen
I'll just lay low here for the time being
Even though I risk falling in that Black Hole

Now that I have seen all that there is in this land
I've proven my worth to my fellow man
I'll just take a backseat to what's going on
Even though I risk falling in that Black Hole

Selling my soul
No remainder for the fools
Losing all control
All that is, is the wind of my soul
In that Black Hole
Black Hole
Black Hole
Black Hole

Now that I have seen all that there is in this land
I've proven my worth to my fellow man
I'll just take a backseat to what's going on
Even though I risk falling in... alright!

Selling my soul
No remainder for the fools
Losing all control
All that is, the wind of my soul, yeah
Black Hole
Black Hole
Black Hole
Black Hole

10. Mountain Of Power
Sure enough can't figure out
Why all that's good is sin
Why people choose to grovel at
The feet of some dreamed up king

Too scared to fight their own way
So easy to be sheep
Alive but dead inside
Holier than thou

Condemning all around them
They're the chosen ones
Now hypocrisy's king
Defiling everything
And at judgement's hour crumble, yeah
Crumble you mountain of power

Still signs of hope are many
Reason covers ground
Two thousand years of twisted lies
Soon just a burial mound

Too scared to fight their own way
So easy to be sheep
Alive but dead inside
Holier than thou

Condemning all around them
They're the chosen ones
Now hypocrisy's king
Defiling everything
And at judgement's hour crumble, yeah
Crumble you mountain of power

Now hypocrisy's king
Defiling everything
And at judgement's hour crumble, yeah
You mountain of power

Now hypocrisy's king
Defiling everything
And at judgement's hour crumble, yeah
You mountain of power
You mountain of power
Yeah
Mountain of power
Yeah, you mountain of...

GRAND MAGUS LYRICS


1. Kingslayer
Leech of power wanting more as you feed - never satisfied
Crowned usurper wasting time and our wealth - you must go

And we'll see him falling now
Christian ruler die!
See you falling
Kingslayer rise

All false methods you're arrogant and vain - above the law
Your blood is feeble a failing line of heirs - down you go

And we'll see him falling now
Christian ruler die!
See you falling
Kingslayer rise

Kingslayer rise!

And we'll see him falling now
Christian ruler die!
See you falling
Kingslayer rise

2. Nine
Nine, nine days of pain
Been discovering
Nine, reborn again
Wisdom filling him

Wield the sword

Hanged, by free will doomed
Trusting just in strength
Hanged, rewarded soon
Growing tall again

Wield the sword

3. Blodorn

4. Wolf's Return
Wolf's return - Iron veined
We are joined - Scream my name

They believe - Man rules all
No regard - For grey one's call
Misguided hate - Caused by fear
Blame the hunter - But keep weapons near

He'll return - Standing proud
New blood coursing - Better now
Shadow fighter - Iron veined
Fill my soul - Scream his name

Life - A soulless kiss
We are joined - Scream my name

Wolf's return - Iron veined
We are joined - Scream my name

5. Blood Oath
Living on the edge of darkness
Gives a man a certain point of view
Never shared by you

Raven's hunger will be stilled
Giving back to nature what I hjad
Joy is the fact, I'm never turning back

Living on - Ever on
Blood Oath
Blood Oath
Living on

One for one and all still one
Honour has a price that must be paid
Time to choose your way
Not your fault that you've been blind
But the time to think is now at hand
Every woman, child and man

Living on - Ever on
Blood Oath
Blood Oath
Living on

Blood Oath
My oath of blood lives on

6. Jarnbord
[Instrumental]

7. Repay In Kind
Screams - tear the night
No more holding on
Fear - taking flight
Searing sound is born

Piercing your mind
Repaying in kind

I've been released
I've been unleashed
I've called
Now I'm free

I've been released
I've been unleashed
Stealing your mind
Repay in kind

Storm - icy blasts
Ripping through your soul
Eyes - mirthless gaze
Crimson oath is sworn

Piercing your mind
Repaying in kind

I've been released
I've been unleashed
I've been called
Now I'm free

I've been released
I've been unleashed
Stealing your mind
Repay in kind

8. Hamnd
[Instrumental]

9. Ashes
Laughter dies out - Honest and cold
Life drains away - My last will done

Sowing the seed
Filling the need
Taking the lead
Sowing the seed

Send out the winds - Ashes fill the sky
No more in pain - Defiant as I die

Sun sinking down - Twilight sets in
Leaving the cage - My testament

Sowing the seed
Filling the need
Taking the lead
Sowing the seed

Send out the winds - Ashes fill the sky
No more in pain - Defiant as I die

Filling the need
Sowing the seed

Send out the winds - Ashes fill the sky
No more in pain - Defiant as I die

10. Light Hater
Questioning - All that is spoken
Refuse to kneel - Before all your altars
Walking up - Seeking black knowledge
Beneath the veil - Truth revealed

Science - Darkness
Shining - Light Hater

Listening - Forever searching
Never still - The ultimate craving
Claim the prize - Rise! Be rewarded
Wish fulfilled - Now, gates are opened

Science - Darkness
Shining - Light Hater

Claim the prize - Rise! Be rewarded
Wish fulfilled - Now, gates open

Science - Darkness
Shining - Light Hater
Light Hater

GRAND MAGUS LYRICS


1. On Hooves Of Gold
They are masters of defiance - masters of the wind
Let us fly together - let the change begin
Mountains lie below us - the stars are getting near
All doubt has left my being - strength replacing fear
And they said it's too late - but the bastards will pay

As we ride the wind and fly
On hooves of gold we ride

Consuming without feeling - a hollow life of shame
The elders, well of knowledge - discarded, thrown away
New gods taking over - thievery and false pride
Burn the gifts of nature, laugh at the giver of life
With greed raping the land
They don't even know what they demand, no
And they say it's too late - but the bastards will pay

As we ride the wind and fly
On hooves of gold we ride

Ride the wind - change begin
And they say it's too late
But the bastards will pay

As we ride the wind and fly
On hooves of gold we ride

2. Steel Versus Steel
"I was a thousand times more evil than thou"

Drifting away into dreams of despair
Visions of doom and of dead eyes that stare
Will the end be what you thought - will you escape?
Across the plains you rode as you fled
The lord of chaos put a price on your head
And the black blade at your side won't let you rest

To slay became a trade
Your soul will have to pay
The final fate a clash between the blades

And in the end it's steel versus steel
The final lock and the final key
It's the steel versus steel
A thousand souls won't tame the need
Steel versus steel
The final lock and the final key
Steel versus steel

Skin as white as the full moon at night
Eyes that burn like a red fire light
But the body's still as weak as a newborn child
Tried to rule with mercy inside
Ignore tradition and the dragons will rise
The dreaming city falls - lost in time

To slay became a trade
Your soul will have to pay
The final fate a clash between the blades

'Cause in the end it's steel versus steel
The final lock and the final key
It's the steel versus steel
A thousand souls won't tame the need
Steel versus steel
The final lock and the final key
Steel versus steel

A thousand souls won't tame the need
To slay became a trade
You will travel on the seas of fate
The seas of fate - between the blades
The price to pay - the end of time
The final fate a clash between the blades

And in the end it's steel versus steel
The final lock and the final key
Steel versus steel
A thousand souls won't tame the need
Steel versus steel
The final lock and the final key
Steel versus steel
A thousand souls won't tame the need
It's the steel versus steel
The final lock and the final key - the steel

3. Fight
They forged an alliance - and legions attend
They steal and conspire - all means to an end
Soon they must fall - we'll rise from our crawl
And summon the strength from within

'Cause we will fight for the right to defend
Fight for the right till the end
Conquer and divide
Fight for the right to survive

Through ages of darkness, slavery and pain
The lie they call "progress" - an expanding domain
Soon they must fall - we'll rise from our crawl
And summon the strength from within

And we will fight for the right to defend
Fight for the right 'til the end
Conquer and divide
Fight for the right to survive

Fight with the power of rage
Fight to the end of our age
With fury burning inside
Fight for the right to survive

For too long did we relent
While they stole at our expense
Now the tide has turned
They must fall
and we will rise standing tall

[Solo]

Fight with the power of rage
Fight to the end of our age
With fury burning inside
Fight for the right to survive

Fight for the right to defend
Fight for the right 'til the end
Conquer and divide
Fight for the right to survive

4. Triumph And Power
Room to breathe
Fill my need
Give me space
Plant the seed

Born alone
Slowly grown
There's a strength
In my breed

Now my goal
Has been shown
As I march
'Til dawn

For the triumph and the power
Spoils of war
For the hunger and desire
A blood red throne
I ascend to the sky
By the dawn's early light
Fight for glory until death
Hail victory

Will of iron
Quiet soul
Empty words
Empty roles

Break their walls
Break their rules
Fiercely defiant
Damn the fools

Now my goal
Has been shown
As I march
'Til dawn

For the triumph and the power
Spoils of war
For the hunger and desire
A blood red throne
I ascend to the sky
By the dawn's early light
Fight for glory until death
Hail victory

At last there's a reason to believe
To rise from the depths of misery
My heart clad in iron
My soul clad in steel
The triumph and power achieved

As I march
'Til dawn

For the triumph and the power
Spoils of war
For the hunger and desire
A blood red throne
I ascend to the sky
By the dawn's early light
Fight for glory until death
Hail victory

For the triumph and the power
Spoils of war
For the hunger and desire
A blood red throne
I ascend to the sky
By the dawn's early light
Fight for glory until death
Hail victory

5. Dominator
He made a promise many years ago to break and scorch the land
He had a need for destruction and to bend us to the ground
He swore an oath: To bring us fear and pain
To never bend or rest until it's done - before he had become

The dominator - freedom hater - he will break us, crush our dreams
Amputator - lacerator - spreading madness, mindless hate - dominate

Bringing everlasting pain
So many tragedies and years ago for you to understand
The devastation that he brought will leave a mark until the end
He swore an oath - to bring us fear and pain
To never bend or rest until it's done - before he had become

The dominator - freedom hater - he will break us, crush our dreams
Amputator - lacerator - spreading madness, mindless hate - dominate

He walks alone
He'll put out our fire with scorn
He'll never rest - just enslave us
Destroyer of beasts and of man
Enforcer of madness and pain
He's sworn to break us - the dominator
Born of hate - Crush and break - Annihilate - Dominate
I swore an oath - I will reverse his plan
I will restore - bringing power to the land, but the price is that I am

The dominator - freedom hater - I will bleed you, crush your dreams
Amputator - lacerator - spreading madness, mindless hate - breathing pain

Born of hate - Crush and break - Annihilate – Dominate

6. Arv
[Instrumental]
7. Holmgång
You're awaiting your turn, jealousy burns - you know you had your chance
Wanting to lead, filling your greed - envy drives your plans
Stole what I made, all that I saved - never letting up
But in the end there can be only one - and justice will be done

Take your light
Got nowhere to run
Bring the fight
You know the time is now
Steal your life
Got nowhere to run
Take your light

Sun in the back when I attack - there is no return
Beckoning time, I know what is mine - only you will burn
In the light of the day you'll finally pay - this is what you learn
In the end there can be only one - and justice will be done

Take your light
Got nowhere to run
Bring the fight
Justice will be done
Steal your life
Got nowhere to run
Take your light
There can be only one
Take your light
Got nowhere to run
Bring the fight
You know the time is now
Steal your life
Got nowhere to run
Take your light

8. The Naked And The Dead
In a flash he turned to stone
Hesitated, lost control
Just a man a dying warrior
Battleground drenched in blood
Bodies flayed down in the mud
Mercy never came on this day

For the naked and the dead
There's no glory or reward to be had
If the spirit travels on it's by will power alone
'Cause the body's just a cell of flesh and blood

While the blood seeps to the ground
There are times you realise
How the pain can change your life
Bragging fools will surely pay the price
No set of rules will end the strife
You have to twist and bend in life
The mind is what defines a warrior

For the naked and the dead
There's no glory or reward to be had
If the spirit travels on it's by will power alone
'Cause the body's just a cell of flesh and blood

For the naked and the dead
There's no glory or reward to be had
And if the spirit travels on it's by will power alone
'Cause the body's just a cell of flesh and blood
While the blood seeps to the ground
Only the chosen one will rise

9. Ymer
[Instrumental]
10. The Hammer Will Bite
The giant arrived, scheming to end Asa rule
Mean as a whip, hard as a rock but a fool
The battle will start at the first light of tomorrow
Jorunheim knew what the thunder would bring

The hammer will bite - no other choice than surrender
Bow to the might - a fiery death from above
The hammer will bite - shattering stone and offenders
Run for your lives - thunder and doom crack the sky
The hammer will bite - you will die

Colossal in size, they built him with magic and clay
Heart from a horse, a fatal mistake for this day
Protector of Asgard never lacked courage
The towering help to the giants will fail

The hammer will bite - no other choice than surrender
Bow to the might - a fiery death from above
The hammer will bite - shattering stone and offenders
Run for your lives - thunder and doom crack the sky
The hammer will bite - you will die

By morning light - the giants die
My death is guaranteed - unless I make him bleed
I can't face him on my own - it's sorcery I need
My help is gone - I'm on my own
My stone is thrown - all is lost

The hammer will bite - no other choice than surrender
Bow to the might - a fiery death from above
The hammer will bite - shattering stone and offenders
Run for your lives - thunder and doom crack the sky
The hammer will bite - you will die
By morning light - the giants die

GRAND MAGUS LYRICS


1. Like The Oar Strikes The Water
Defile your life with religion
And sell your soul
You put all trust in your holy man

You may deny it's illusion
Just worthless rules
You turn away when you thin you can

Corrupting life with suppression
The safest way
You wash your hands in your piety

The winds have turned in your favour
Your time is here
A congregation on a massive scale

But when the night finally falls
And when the truth finally dawns

Just like the oar strikes the water

But when the night finally falls
Yeah when the truth finally dawns

Just like the oar strikes the water

2. Fear Is The Key
Hear crushing thunder
Electrifying storm
Winter is calling
Time to hold one's own

Fear is the weapon
To break the cage of man
Control lies inside me
The terror reveals the plan

Unbeliever, unbeliever
The mind will tell me how
Fear is the key

Last of the shadows
Screaming out my name
Strong determination
A guide through searing flame

Blind Beliver
Choose the easy way
Pray for absolution
You know you've gone astray

When blackest depths will face me
Ask no one's help, to break my fall
Born, dead and free forever
I know that fear is the key

3. Iron Will
Failure - reaching out to greet me
But I will never fall
Aversion - has filled my inner being
But I will never crawl

Obsession - I never fell the pain
Redemption - I will rise again

Again and again

Iron will
I'll never give in or surrender
Iron will
Remind me to always remember

Hatred - it used to feel so easy
Turn away when they call
Craving - driven by the strong need
Alone against them all

Aggression - fuelled by burning hate
Vengeance - I will rise again

Again and again

Iron will
I'll never give in or surrender
Iron will
Remind me to always remember

4. Hövding
[Instrumental]

5. Silver Into Steel
Time is at hand

Gathering hunger in the night
To feast and to burn
better look for the right of his hands
Summon a feeling of might
Caressed by the dark
The glow of the moon in the eye

Kissing the sweet taste in the air
Embraced by the stars
A home has been found in the end
Time is at hand
Of triumph and sense
A revenge for the times of despair

Silver into Steel

6. The Shadow Knows
The laugh will be the warning
He will break your mental wall
Pulverize resistance
Then sacrifice you all

His solemn promise given
To never be a slave
To stand among the fallen
And fight beyond the grave

The Shadow knows
The Shadow knows
The Shadow knows
The Shadow knows

Stare into the hearts of men
All Misery Treachery

Through Secrecy Mastery Alchemy
Perish in his fire

The wight of procreation
Will never bring him down
Survive humiliation
And laugh when time is gone

The powers of corruption
Will shiver at his gaze
The weed of crime may blossom
But will perish in his flame

The Shadow knows
The Shadow knows
The Shadow knows
The Shadow knows

Stare into the hearts of men
All Misery Treachery

Through Secrecy Mastery Alchemy
Perish in his fire

7. Self-Deceiver
Crowned by minions swearing loyalty
You are selling maps of life

Dar pretender - naked and alone
Self deceiver

Confront
Defeat
Never triumph

Bow down
Submit
Wishes granted

Dar pretender - naked and alone
Self deceiver

Faking evil, try the best you can
But you'll never find your goal

Dark pretender - naked and alone

Self deceiver

Confront

Never triumph

Bow down
Submit
Wishes granted

This is what you seek

Self deceiver

Confront

Never triumph

Bow down

This is what you seek
This is what you need

Self deceiver

Never triumph

Bow down

8. Beyond Good And Evil
You smile and claim purity of soul
I feel the need to rise above it all

A burning urge will guide me away
Your black and white will lose to the grey

As i walk - beyond good and evil

Your rules betray your need to make a stand
You fight the herd, still need security

There is no true or false in the world
You might be right but I'm not wrong

As i walk - beyond good and evil

beyond good and evil
good and evil
good and evil
beyond good and evil

9. I Am The North
Joined by the cry of ravens
A chase in the winter cold
First born son of storms
hated and scorned

Free from the cage of morals
Shadow of the ruling kind
The echoes of the savage call
Roll across the land

Truth and lie will join and die
Grey ruler show us how to fight

The Wolf will rise
The end of lies
Corruption dies
Free forever

Burn with the lord of sorrow
Claimed by the shit of nails
Life and death - final breath
Born into the grave

Storm of an ancient fury
Power beyond compare
Serpent's flood - brother's blood
End of times is here

Truth and lie will join and die
Grey ruler show us how to fight

GRAND MAGUS LYRICS


1. I, The Jury
Damnation - their lies used to lead me away
Feeding my desperate heart - with merciless flames
I soon realized there's nothing to gain
And all the dreams that I had had got lost in my pain

I want to learn - I want to see
I'm gonna learn - gonna see - and I'm gonna turn

Because I'm the Law

Wisdom has sprung - and taken my heart
Nothing will stand in my way - I'll tear them apart
Revelation - no one can lead me astra
Follow my own burning path - away from all slaves

I want to learn - I want to see
I'm gonna learn - gonna see - and I'm gonna turn

Because I'm the Law

Riding the teeth of the wind - all barriers part

I want to learn - I want to see
I'm gonna learn - gonna see - and I'm gonna turn

Because I'm the Law

2. Hammer Of The North
Black fire
burns in the twilight
The forest glows
Free heart
passion and defiance
pine and hooded crow
Spring eve
glory of the raven
melt the last of the snow
Gold sparks - set the night afire

It's my joy

Hammer of the North

It's late - silver stars shining - a toast to future goals
Black sky - everlasting beauty - brothers by my side
We smile - nature's celebration - we're fierce yet calm
Gold sparks - set the night afire

It's my joy

We'll learn every secret, we'll trample the cross
We'll curse at the giants, we'll laugh as we toss

Hammer of the North
We believe it's our legacy
Masters of our fate - their logic won't dictate

Their gods will fail - then we rise

Hammer of the North

3. Black Sails
Whipping in the wind
Rule with fear and dreams that tear the light
Sleepless empty nights

A shiver of desperation
Black sails rippling in the wind
Will the dream provide liberation?
Or pain in the end

Haunting dreams of red
Bringing doom - Bringing death
Black sails charge ahead
Rule with dread

Simple life seems hard
Looming shadows
They stalk

A shiver of desperation
Black sails rippling in the wind
Will the dream provide liberation?
Or pain in the end

Haunting dreams of red
Bringing doom - Bringing death
Black sails charge ahead
Rule with dread

The sea turns red
Bringing doom - Bringing death
Black sails charge ahead
Rule with dread

4. Mountains Be My Throne
I'm coming don to the meeting
There's trouble all around
A final push for the silence
The symbol has been shown

Now if I can't wield the power
I'll find another way
Without your guide, will you make it?
Just sheep that go astray

Rising
Watch me climbing
Far away - where nothing binds me
I'm done with all your fighting
Make it known - let mountains be my throne

Rising
Watch me climbing
Far away - where nothing binds me
I'm done with all your fighting
Make it known - let mountains be my throne

Rising
Watch me climbing
Soaring high, the sun won't bind me
I'm done with all your fighting
Make it known - let mountains be my throne

5. Northern Star
Living in denial and never seeing straight or clear
Deep down in your senses you feel that fear
Fear of true alliance, nothing worth the fight
No use standing up when wrong rule what's right

When they bring you despair
Don't resort to prayer

Time for fast decisions
Now it's live or die
Strength is summoned from within
Northern star

Banish the false religions
Learn to stand alone
Nothing up above and no one below
Fear of new beginnings
Like a demon in your soul
You must turn your ear to the beckoning call

When they bring you despair
Don't resort to prayer

Time for fast decisions
Now it's live or die
Weakness spreading like a plague
Will you make the change or stay the same and fail
Strength is summoned from within
Northern star

6. The Lord Of Lies
The lord of lies
He'll steal your life away
And grasp the victor's prize - He's born of fire
He'll claim your soul as pray
The trickster of all time
The lord of lies

Take a deep breath
Watch the forest pull him in
Preparations - Soon the trials will begin

A sacrifice - to make it work he must endure the pain
A conjuring - free the magic, fan the flames again

The lord of lies
He'll steal your life away
And grasp the victor's prize
He's born of fire
He'll claim your soul as pray
The trickster of all time
The lord of lies

Son of giants
Lust and hate is his disguise
Purifier - Naked he'll escape the fires

A sacrifice - to make it work he must endure the pain
A conjuring - free the magic, fan the flames again

The lord of lies
He'll steal your life away
And grasp the victor's prize - He's born of fire
He'll claim your soul as pray
The trickster of all time
The lord of lies

7. At Midnight They'll Get Wise
The barren land lies empty, no enemies in sight
Though no one ever told them, at midnight they'll get wise
As shadow falls upon them,
no one even dares to speak your name

They'll be given the lesson of their lives
Blood and death will follow

As they get wise
To the lies they believed to be real
And they will pay the price by facing the truth and its deal
When they die
At midnight they'll get wise

A shape of hidden power, a presence of true might
Trust in feral knowledge, their fires will die out
Servants to a coward, no one even dares to stand alone

Eyes roll back in terror - the panic starts to rise
Blood and death will follow

As they get wise
To the lies they believed to be real
And they will pay the price by facing the truth and its deal
When they die
At midnight they'll get wise

Watch the hunt-god rise

8. Bond Of Blood
A never ending tale
You lose but never fail
You're going to be the last to learn
To see what's right and wrong
You waited much too long
The truth is somewhere in between
but you've never seen

Now as I burn in fire
You will recall - you will remember my name
Smouldering sea, smoke rises
You'll see the truth
you will be taught by the flames

Bond of blood

Suppose you change your ways
A simple choice to make
You'll be rewarded by yourself
Possessing all that skill
To use at your own will
You better find another way
Or you'll go astray

Now as I burn in fire
You will recall - you will remember my name
Smouldering sea, smoke rises
You'll see the truth
you will be taught by the flames

Bond of blood

9. Savage Tales
See the savage son arrive
striking terror on all sides
He's been waiting all this time
for his reign to come alive

Bite
he will do or die
Fight to hold on, aim for the throne
Bite
he will burn their pride
Rise northern child you've grown

See the iron sky descend
on a world that just pretends
It's a lonely path to walk
but an honor to defend

Those who walk against the wind
will always walk alone

10. Ravens Guide Our Way
We ride endless blackened waves
To  the land of our kin
Snow lords, kings of northern seas
Brought us home again
True hearts gathering up our will
Conquered what we chose
Black wings lead us to the fray
Gave us victory

Legions stood against us
They tried to make us pay
But never faltered or failed
We are cunning - Ravens guide our way

Crossfire lit the northern shore
Never stopped our return
Not force, driven by our fate
Gave us victory

Legions stood against us
They tried to make us pay
But never faltered or failed
We are cunning - Ravens guide our way

Black birds fly
Guide us home
Leave your throne

GRAND MAGUS LYRICS


1. Freja's Choice
Truth in lying
Never can tell
Words that twist and betray
Lore of secrets
Casting her spell
Charms to lure you away

Sorceress
Master of the Sejd
She'll light the way

Her eyes will leave a mark
Her dreams will fill the heart
Her name brings out desire
Riddles in the dark

She'll light the spark

Falcon wings forever soaring
Goddess of the fallen warriors home

Fateful Beauty
Glowing and pure
Turn your gaze down in awe
Golden Mistress
Sowing the need
Sacrifice to receive

Maiden of the shield guides you ashore
The prize of war
Ride on silver wing
Let Valkyries take you home
Her gift is of love
A chance to be reborn

Falcon wings forever soaring
Goddess of the fallen warriors home

Falcon wings forever soaring
Goddess of the fallen warriors home

Freja's choice is always glory
Borne upon the blood-stained wings of war

Blood-stained wings of war

2. Varangian
Fire will guide us on perilous seas
Light in the black the sign that we need
Charge through the storm
Swords in our hands
Leave it to fate or fear takes command

Into the fray
We die and we slay
Our home up above
The hall of the brave

We are warriors – defenders of steel
Fight through the wars, hunger and need
Warriors – defenders of steel
Burn our way to Odin's hall
From all battlefields

Bravery, loyalty bound by the oath
Sworn to protect so far from our home
Guarding a throne, an emperor's reign
Honour is all to the god of the slain

Into the fray
We die and we slay
Our home up above
The hall of the brave

We are warriors – defenders of steel
Fight through the wars, hunger we feed
Warriors – defenders of steel
Burn our way to Odin's hall
From all battlefields

Into the fray
We die and we slay
Our home up above
The hall of the brave

We are warriors – defenders of steel
Fight through all wars, hunger we feed
Warriors – defenders of steel
Burn our way to Odin's hall
From all battlefields

Burn our way to Odin's hall

3. Forged In Iron - Crowned In Steel
All the prophets and deceivers
Try to lead us all astray
We're trusting only in the blade
And the path of destiny
Too proud to kneel
But not to bend
This sword will bring your end
The key to victory is ours
Wielding power in our hand

Bringing
Viking metal – bring you to your knees
Viking metal – a warrior's decree
Viking metal – death is victory
Forged in iron, crowned in steel – Viking metal

We will feed the eagle
We have the means we have the will
Break through your fortress
And your armour
Our edge is primed to kill
We live and die
Our fate is planned
No one fears his end
The key to victory is ours
Wielding power in our hand

Bringing
Viking metal – bring you to your knees
Viking metal – a warrior's decree
Viking metal – death is victory
Forged in iron, crowned in steel – Viking metal

My enemies they must fall down
Mud in the blood-stained ground

Odin grant me gold and glory
Key to victory
Sword of power

Viking metal – bring you to your knees
Viking metal – a warrior's decree
Viking metal – death is victory
Forged in iron, crowned in steel – Viking metal

Odin grant me gold and glory
Key to victory
Sword of power

4. Born For Battle (Black Dog Of Brocéliande)
You were just a child when the flame began to burn
You could not run you could not hide
No one told you there was so much more to learn
Just would not stop before you tried

You hear the calling
Inside you knew

Born for battle
I heard the calling
Hated and scorned
My sword was the warning
I'll defend when you call for

The king has justified the cruelty and pain
A crown and glory
To revel in
Short in stature but a savior to the land
Just let them burn and let me win

I heard the calling
Inside I knew

Born for battle
I heard the calling
Hated and scorned
My sword was the warning
I'll defend to the end

I'm the underdog
Never bark before I bite
Peace a word I never learned
In war my victories mean strife and loss of lives
Never cared if I'd return
Born for battle

My need was created at birth
For glory and blood I was born – burn

Never cared if I'd return

Born for battle
I heard the calling
I'll defend when you call for battle
My sword was the warning
I was born for battle

5. Master Of The Land
Light, the search goes on inside
Deep within my mind
A key that seems to hide
Torn, chained and bound with scorn
Let me be reborn
Into glory ride

Make me master of the land
Master of the land
Master of the land
Answer the call into the fire burn

Free, longing to reveal
A dream so long concealed
Destiny achieved
Burn, wisdom will be mine
Secrets I will learn
Into glory ride

Make me master of the land
Master of the land
Master of the land
Answer the call into the fire

Make me master of the land
Master of the land
Master of the land
Answer the call 

Make me master of the land
Master of the land
Master of the land
Answer the call into the fire burn

6. Last One To Fall
Facing the enemy fear and insanity
Fight with your back to the wall
Horses are falling no quarter is given
Ravens will feast on them all
Gather your strength and ride through the storm
No one will catch you alive
It weather of blades and as twilight sets in
This is the final goodbye

Marching on -
You'll be the last one to fall
Marching on -
You'll be the last one to fall

Bereft of all dignity, pain and depravity
No one will live through this day
The sound of the suffering left as an offering
Souls sent to Valhalla's gates
You stand in the rain as you fought through it all
Tomorrow will never appear
Embracing your fate as the dusk closes in
Blood is the prize of the brave

Marching on -
You'll be the last one to fall
Marching on -
You'll be the last one to fall

Bereft of all dignity
Blood is the prize of the brave
No one will live through this day
Souls sent to Valhalla's gates

Ride through the storm
Song of the sword

You'll be marching on
You'll be the last one to fall
Marching on -
You'll be the last one to fall

7. Frost And Fire
Burning hair
Bringer of despair
Mother of the one who takes the moon
Fierce and tall she will devour all
And her spawn will break the seal of runes

Winds that rage across the fields and lakes
She will ride out from the frozen realm
Screaming through the sky
Wreathed in fury

With frost and fire tame the land
She'll rule, take charge and command

Shadow steed will bring her fatal deeds
And a power never seen before
Serpent reins on a wolf from Hel
She descended on the funeral shore
The gathering didn't have her strength
And she proved that she could best them all
Daughter of the ironwood has come

With frost and fire tame the land
She'll rule, take charge and command

As the ring horn sails
She has won
And her sons will rise

Frost and fire tame the land
She'll rule, take charge and command

With frost and fire tame the land
She'll rule, take charge and command

8. Hugr
[Instrumental]
9. Every Day There's A Battle To Fight
All the walls around you
No one really knows how they were made
Who chose that way?
Conformity or safety
Questioning your sanity is brave
You're not a slave, no
Too many hearts grow stale and cold
Too many die inside and fold

Everyday there's a battle to fight
Never let yourself surrender to the pain
You've got to get up
Be strong and fight them all 
Never let the fear stand in your way

Find the key inside you
Shining through the madness and the hate

It's not too late
A path is always open
Reborn into the thunder and the rain
Free from all shame, yeah
The smallest creatures have it right
The truth is grey not black and white

Everyday there's a battle to fight
Never let yourself surrender to the pain
You've got to get up
Be strong and fight them all 
Never let the fear stand in your way

Stand in your way

10. In For The Kill
Born again as dusk approaches
I've been living far too long as a slave
To the laws of your world
Sound the howl of total freedom
Make the sky and earth my kingdom
There's a gleam and a flash in my eyes
By tomorrow all the sorrow will be gone

I am in for the kill
One with the moon and the wind
In for the kill
One with the moon and the wind

Now their walls give no protection
The grip of fear means no detection
Of the force set upon men and gods
No belief and no religion
Will protect your life from leaving
As the fear reaches out to your soul
It's a grasp that will never let its hold

I am in for the kill
One with the moon and the wind
In for the kill
One with the moon and the wind

You will die

GRAND MAGUS LYRICS


1. Starlight Slaughter
Go on tell me 'bout the reason always turning wrong from right just try, explain your sad existence, why you seem to fear the night
Your answer will show - that dead is your king
I look in your eyes - confusion within
You lose all your pride, and scream as i bite
In a starlight slaughter - vengeance will be mine
Starlight slaughter - rise of wolf kind
Too late, I asked you and i listened and groveling won't save you now
Your tales betray your lack of freedom, struggling to face the light
My Hymn to the moon piercing your mind
Your science will fail
Your eyes turn blind
When red turns to black and the silver moon is full
They will drown in lakes of blood, and regret what they tried to pull
Starlight slaughter - vengeance will be mine
Starlight slaughter - rise of wolf kind

2. Sword Of The Ocean
The first was the last one
The last one to fall
He sounded the warning
And put out the call
Remorseless invaders or traders with gold?
Stand or run
Will flesh pay for metal or riches be shared - stand or run
We bring the fire and the flame
Agony and pain
Sword of the ocean carve me your name
The men on the shoreline
Guardians of old
They prayed for a warning
They ran from the wall
Remorseless invaders or traders with gold?
Stand or run
Will flesh pay for metal or riches be shared - stand or run
We bring the fire and the flame
Agony and pain
Sword of the ocean carve me your name

3. Valhalla Rising
Feel – take my hand
See – wasted lands

‘Cause I lost my fire, and it’s tearing up my soul
Got to fight if I want it
So tired of liars, they’re filling me with shame
Got to fight and get stronger

But the road is long and treachery awaits
To find what’s wrong I have to reach and reveal to see

Valhalla rising – I’m taking flight
Let Valkyries guide me to my destiny
Valhalla rising – I burn tonight
Let ravens fly and give my soul release
The fire is the seed

Take my hand!
No more wasted lands...

I restored my fire now it’s filling up my soul
Even though I was broken
And I fought the liars – the worst of all was me
All the false words I’d spoken

As I travelled on I realised my fate
It made me strong and now I finally see what's been revealed

Valhalla rising – I’m taking flight
Let Valkyries guide me to my destiny
Valhalla rising – I burn tonight
Let ravens fly and give my soul release
The fire was the seed

Take my hand!
No more wasted lands...

And now I finally see what's been revealed

Valhalla rising – I’m taking flight
Let Valkyries guide me to my destiny
Valhalla rising – I burn tonight
Let ravens fly and give my soul release
The fire was the seed

Take my hand!

4. Storm King
Time to reap all the violence they have sewn
Kept you down with their torture
Crushed your bones
From slavery your rebellion screams of fire
Too late 'cause you'll never be their pawn
You've grown too strong
You're the Storm King
Ride the lightning
Rule the thunder shake the ground
Two thousand years spent imprisoned
You were chained
Born a stallion but broken down - hurt and malmed
A fury and rage ignited in the tears
they'll pay and you'll never be their pawn
You've grown too strong
You're the Storm King
Ride the lightning
Rule the thunder, shake the ground

5. Silver Moon
Unleashed by my hate -
Flesh torn away from the bone
A fire that burns - a fever that never subsides
Surrender to fate - free from the shackles that bind
By the silvery sheen -
The moon will decide who will die
I've found the strength to live alone
I've left my kin I've left my home
By silver light I'll carve my own
To last and live my power's grown

Embers - burning runes
Sever the ties - destiny calls
Black sky - silver moon
I'm gonna rise - you're gonna fall

Summoning fire - men of the cross stand aside
A heathen belief - northern revenge is at hand
No masters or kings -
The cry for my freedom resounds
The passion is free -
The blood-covered snow is the sign

Embers - burning runes
Sever the ties - destiny calls
Black sky - silver moon
I'm gonna rise - you're gonna fall

6. The Hunt
He's alive -- the stories were right
And now there's a lesson to learn

Took his land and curse him as damned
But now he will make them all burn

Tonight the grey one's arrived
To reveal all the lies, the shadow's arrived
And he won't shed a tear for our emptiness and fear

Blood will spill
I follow the hunt
Chase and kill
Follow the hunt

Running free, the beast inside of me
Will join in his howl to the moon

Every sense come alive
And the passion ignites

'cause his beckoning call brings us doom

Tonight the grey one's arrived
To reveal all the lies, the shadow's arrived
And he won't shed a tear for our emptiness and fear

Blood will spill
I follow the hunt
Chase and kill
Follow the hunt

Blood will stain the land
As the hunt will take command

Tonight the grey one's arrived
To reveal all the lies,

Blood will spill
I follow the hunt
Chase and kill
Follow the hunt

Blood will spill
We follow the hunt
Chase and kill
We follow the hunt

7. Son Of The Last Breath: Part I -- Nattfödd, Part II -- Vedergällning
[Part I: Nattfödd]

One night in November my soul found a heart
In glistening frost by the light of the stars
One night in November my soul found its home
In the glow of the moon I was born
All my grief washed away
It's the end of my plight
No mourning was left
Only feral delight
All my grief washed away
By the blood that was shed
In the glow of the moon I was born

[Part II: Vedergällning]

Hide all trace
Count the days
Nine to reach my fate
Nine days t obring the change
Destiny fulfilled
Eight brings me sight
Seven gives me light
Six days and wounds are healed
Strength has returned
Bless the mighty Thor
Blood will stain your shores
Swear I will return
Prepare yourself for war
Praise the mighty Thor
Blood will stain your shores
Swear I will return
Prepare yourself for war
I will hide all trace
Count the days
Nine to reach my fate
Swear to return
Nine days to bring the change
Destiny fulfilled
Five proves me right
Four ends the fight
Three, two and one completes the change
Then I will rise

8. Iron Hand
You speak of hell and how you fell
Looking out for something new
You broke the law, you've seen it all
Really nothing more to tell
But you miss a vital piece - the key to everlasting power
Yes you lack the inner strength - a way to push them all aside
Steel will guide you right
Got to keep it locked inside you at all times - never let them see the way to climb
Rulel them all - feel the grip of an iron hand - take command
Rule them - to make it last and to remain, never let confusion reign
You speak of pain and always claim
You never really had a chance
But there's a call to break them all
Listen now or try in vain
There's a way to build the strength - a path to everlasting power
Summon up the right defense - and you'll break their will to fight
Steel will guide you right
Got to keep it locked inside you at all times, never let them see the way to climb
Rule them all - feel the grip of an iron hand - take command
Rule them - to make it last and to remain, never let confusion reign
Rule them all
Rule with an iron hand or you will fall

9. Draksådd
There's a lock inside the lonely cell, but we fail to find the key
There's a way to solve the riddles quick, but we always choose to leace
If the urge to hurt the weaker one gets stronger than before
Maybe wisdom leaves us all alone and we'll never break the door
If we refuse to take heed or learn - why would I stay or be concerned?
If the madness will spread like fire - why would I wish I could return?
There's a wall that separates us and divides
Hide the greed - put on a pleasant smile
Break the fall yet you're ashamed to be alive
Build a solid web of lies, web of lies
So we're pushing on for selfishness, while me march on forever blind
We develop as we sell our souls, and the connection is lost in time
If we refuse to take heed or learn - why would I stay or be concerned?
If the madness would spread like fire - why would I wish I could return?
There's a wall that separates us and divides
Hide the greed - put on a pleassant smile
Break the fall yet you're ashamed to be alive
Build a solid we b of lies, web of lies
No use in waiting for it - your kind will never understand
What separates us is a plan
There's a wall that separates us and divides
Hide the greed - put on a pleasant smile
Break the fall yet you're ashamed to be alive
Spin a solid web of lies, web of lies

GRAND MAGUS LYRICS


1. Death Tone
[R. Friedman/ J. DeMaio]

Ridin' on two wheels
Chains hooked on my heels
Sittin' in leather...
Ridin' on steel
Put my shades on
Hair blows in the wind
I give some square the finger
Now he won't look again, no he won't
[PreChorus:]
Now, you were sittin' home
And I got sent to Nam
I went to the big house
You just worked a job
[Chorus:]
Hear me calling
Can't you hear my death tone
Hear me calling
Can't you hear my death tone
Hear me ride
On into the night
Pull along side
If you're looking for a fight, yeah !
My social workers
Got me on a chain

So the paper prints his name, yes it does, and he likes it
Unemployment checks

2. Metal Daze
[J. DeMaio]

I hear the sound
In a metal way
I feel the power
Rolling off the stage
Cause only one thing
Really sets me free
Heavy Metal
Loud as it can be
Baby I was born to play music
I'm a man with a screamin guitar
There's a light in the middle of the stage
In a minute I'll be wearing it all
I don't know another way of living
Baby I don't really care
Give me a pair of jeans
And a riff that's mean
And girls that love to share
[Chorus:]
Heavy metal, metal daze
Heavy metal, heavy metal daze
Heavy metal, heavy metal daze
Living like there's no tomorrow
Yeah Currie says we're on the edge
He says man you're really graphic
This band a social wedge
Yeah we all got hearts made of metal
and our blood is hot molten rock
And if I don't hear the sound of metal
I go into shock
[Chorus:]
Heavy metal, metal daze
Heavy metal, heavy metal daze
Heavy metal, heavy metal daze
Heavy metal, heavy metal daze
Heavy metal
So mister D. J.
Play just one for me
You know the one
With the crushin' and the screams
'Cause only one thing
Really sets me free
Heavy metal
Loud as it can be
[Chorus:]
Heavy metal, metal daze
Heavy metal, heavy metal daze
Heavy metal, heavy metal daze
heavy metal, heavy metal daze
Heavy metal
Loud as it can be

3. Fast Taker
[R. Friedman / J. DeMaio]

Mama's having problems,
Always comes to me
Your daddy's been a drinker since nineteen forty-three
They tell you I'm a loser
'Cause I like bein' free
The truth is in the mirror
It's what they never see
I said yeah
A long time ago
They tried to tell me, son
Keep our daughter home
I said no no, no no

Now, I don't mind them saying
That you should be praying
For me, a fast taker
Right here's where I'm staying
Life's a game I play for keeps,
Aaaah

Fast Taker,
Bed Breaker,
Love Maker
Take it away

You're only sixteen
A woman, not a girl
Old enough for a trip around the world

Pick you up on Friday
When your daddy goes to sleep
Bring you back on Sunday
When he's watching "Billy Graham" on T.V.
Oh yeah, he won't see me

Now do it right with the music
Then you'll learn how to use it
All night, a fast taker
Right here's where I'm staying
Life's a game I play for keeps,
Aaaah

Fast Taker,
Bed Breaker,
Love Maker
Take it away

Mama's having problems,
Always comes to me
Your daddy's been a drinker since nineteen forty-three
They tell you I'm a loser
'Cause I like bein' free
The truth is in the mirror
It's what they never see
A long time ago
They tried to tell me, son
Keep our daughter home
I said no no, no no

Now, I don't mind them saying
That you should be praying
For me, a fast taker
Right here's where I'm staying
Life's a game I play for keeps,

Love Maker

4. Shell Shock
[R. Friedman/J. DeMaio]

I don't know
Well, there's no charge for the haircut
And the bullets come free
My Uncle Sam sent a letter, said:
He's got a mission for me
Now I'm a ranger, not a stranger
And I live in Saigon
We've got a team of special forces
And we deliver napalm
But if they tell you that I've lost my mind
Baby it's not gone just a little hard to find
By the time this letter gets home
I'd be gone, gone, yeah gone
And if they tell you that I'm M.I.A.
Think a little less about me each day
'Cause if I ever get back
I'll be shell shocked, whoa
Shell shocked, yeah
Feels funny riding in my car
Used to drive a tank and shoot a B.A.R.
I know I'm home
But I feel gone, gone, yeah gone
Now it's over and the homeland's safe
Got a purple heart to show the world I'm brave
The businessmen sat at home
Well I got shell shocked, whoa
Shell shocked, whoa
Shell shock
Shell shock
Shell shock

5. Manowar
[R. Friedman / J. DeMaio]

We met on English ground
In a backstage room
We heard the sound
And we all knew
What we had to do
We called the high command
Requested leave to make a stand
And in the field we grew
And we all knew
Soon the time would come
For us to fight,
Destination
Now in sight
Aaah, Manowar
Born to live forever more
The right to conquer every shore
Hold your ground and give no more
Our fight will never end
So we call on partisans
To raise your hands
And take our stand
Look sharp
When duty calls
Where we march
Cities fall
And the strong survive
And take our side
Now the time has come
For us to fight
Target waiting
In our sight
Aaah, Manowar
Born to live forever more
The right to conquer every shore
Hold your ground and give no more
Manowar
Born to live forever more
The right to conquer every shore
Manowar
Born to live forever more
Manowar
Born to live forever more
The right to conquer every shore
Hold your ground and give no more
Born to live forever more
The right to conquer every shore
Manowar

6. Dark Avenger
[R. Friedman / J. Demaio]

He broke the laws of the elders
So they plucked out his eye,
Took his land and fortune,
Left him to die
Bound on the shoreline,
Left for the tide,
Sees his life-blood leaving...
Circling lower, the vultures fly
His bones may be broken
But the spirit can't die
And the Gods see his anguish
And give him a sign
From the floor of the ocean
The ship of the lost souls rise
And they take him where no one sleeps while the undead cry,
Where no one sleeps while the undead cry...
And in the world above
The elders sing,
On his land they live...
Let death's bell ring

[Narration:]
He was met at the gate of Hades
By the Guardian of the Lost Souls,
The Keeper of the Unavenged
And He did say to him,
"Let ye not pass Abaddon
Return to the world
From whence you came
And seek payment
Not only for thine own anguish
But to vindicate the souls
Of the Unavenged."
And they placed in his hands
A sword
Made for him
Called Vengeance
Forged in brimstone
And tempered
By the woeful tears of the unavenged
And to carry him up on his journey
Back to the upper world
They brought forth
Their Demon horse
Called: Black Death
A grim steed
So fiersome in might
And black in colour
That he could stand as one with the darkness...
Save from his burning eyes
of crimson fire
And on that night
They rode up from Hell
The pounding of his hooves
Did clap like thunder!

[Chorus:]
Burning, death, destruction
Raping the daughters and wives
In blood I take my payment
In full with their lives
No one can escape me
On Black Death I ride
When kissed by the sword of Vengeance
Your head lays there by your side
I take the lives of all that I once knew
The torn flesh of a slow death waits for you

[Chorus:]
Burning, death, destruction
Raping the daughters and wives
In blood I take my payment
In full with their lives
I spare not land or servants
My wake is smoke and flame
I take their wives and daughters
They stand there watching, watching
Hoping to gain their lives
But when I'm through they know that they must pay

[Chorus:]
Burning, death, destruction
Raping the daughters and wives
In blood I take my payment
In full with their lives
With their lives
With their lives
With their lives

7. William's Tale
[INSTRUMENTAL]

[Rossini]

8. Battle Hymns
[R. Friedman/J. DeMaio]

By moonlight we ride
Ten thousands side by side
With swords drawn held high
Our whips and armour shine
Hail to thee our infantry
Still brave beyond the grave
All have sworn the eternal vow
The time to strike is now

[Chorus:]
Kill, kill, Oh !
Kill, kill, Oh !
Kill, kill, Oh !
Kill, kill, Oh !
Gone are the days when freedom shone
Now blood and steel meet bone
In the light of the battle's way
The sands of time will shake
How proud our soldiers stand
With mace and chain in hand
Sound the charge into glory ride
Over the top of the vanguished pride

[Chorus:]
Victory, victory, Oh !
Victory, victory, Oh !
Victory, victory, Oh !
Victory, victory, Oh !
To the battle we ride
We crossed a starlit sky
No space no time
We'll catch the wind
Strange losses, men died
We crossed a starlit sky
And still no space or time
We'll catch the wind

[Chorus:]
Kill, kill, Oh !
Kill, kill, Oh !
Kill, kill, Oh !
Kill, kill, Oh !
Sound of charge into glory ride
Over the top of the anguished pride
By moonlight we ride
Ten thousand side by side

[Chorus:]
Kill, kill, Oh !
Kill, kill, Oh !
Kill, kill, Oh !
Kill, kill, Oh !

9. Death Tone (Live)

MANOWAR LYRICS


1. Warlord
When you see me comin' flying down the road
You know I ain't afraid to lay it down
Yea got me some leather. Leather is my skin
Black'n'chrome flashin' through the town.
Some call me the WARLORD 'cause I'm a god-damn
bad machine, young'n'hungry, not too proud'n'mean
Ride, ride, ride, I'm the WARLORD of the road,
Riding, riding, riding, ain't never growin' old.
Take what I want and I go where I please
Got the world right by the balls. This world ain't
big enough to keep me down. Yea we're livin'
in a sick world. The man on the T.V. said we
got lotsa trouble overseas, well what the hell
do I care? Think they care about me?
Stop sending money send'em all a bomb.
Ride, ride, ride, I'm the WARLORD of the road,
Ridin', ridin', ridin', ain't never growin' old.
Born to live in the fast lane on a chopped up
Harley-D, smell that oil and high test gasoline.
Never got a shortage of girls to share my seat.
Well they all want to know what people say is true,
You know, get a biker started 'n he'll drive all
damn night. Well hold on honey 'cause this ride's
for a ride.
Ride, ride, ride, ride, ride, ride, ride
I'm the WARLORD of the road.
Ridin', ridin', ridin', ain't never growin' old.

2. Secret Of Steel
Atop the mountain, where the river of steel flows
Black is the forest, white was the snow.
There as children, how could children know?
One without name or number soon would show.
There stood he, on his chariot made of gold
He did reveal the trinity of secrets old.
A sceptre of iron could mercy bring.
A shield of gold, the Creator and king,
And the great sword of steel.
Sons of destiny shall wield.
Hear Wisdom's voice.
Rise, know the strength that you feel.
Hold in your heart but never reveal.
You were called by the Gods, their powers to wield.
Guard well the secret of steel.
A sceptre of iron could mercy bring.
A shield of gold, the Creator and king,
And the great sword of steel.
Sons of destiny shall wield.
Hear Wisdom's voice.
Rise, know the strength that you feel.
Hold in your heart but never reveal.
You were called by the Gods, their powers to wield.
Guard well the secret of steel.

3. Gloves Of Metal
Hear the pounding army of the night
The call of metal summons us tonight
And gather we on this site
To behold the power and the might
We wear leather, we wear spikes, we rule the night
Off with the lights, hear the screams
See the banging heads awaken to their dreams.
The sound of metal so loud it cracks the beams
Played by warriors called the Metal Kings.
A hero's welcome for those who heed the call.
We are together, we are all.
With hands high fists fill the air
Against the world we stand.
Hands high forever we'll be there,
Gloves of Metal rule tonight. Yea
A hero's welcome for those who heed the call.
We are together, we are all.
With hands high fists fill the air
Against the world we stand.
Hands high forever we'll be there,
Gloves of Metal rule tonight. Yea
Leather, Metal, Spikes and Chains
Gloves of Metal raised to show the brave.
Into the darkness march the armies of the night.
Bound by metal we live the fight.
We wear leather, we wear spikes, we rule the night
With hands high fists fill the air
Against the world we stand.
Hands high forever we'll be there,
Gloves of Metal rule tonight. Yea

4. Gates Of Valhalla
Valhalla the gods await me
Open wide thy gates embrace me.
Great hall of the battle slain
With sword in hand.
All those who stand on shore
Raise high your hands to bid a last
farewell to the Viking land.
Death's chilling wind blows through my hair
I'm now immortal, I am there
I take my place by Odin's side
Eternal army in the sky.
I point my hatchet to the wind
I guard the gates and all within
Hear my sword sing, as I ride across the sky
Sworn by the sacred blood of Odin onward ride.
Valhalla the gods await me
Open wide thy gates embrace me.
Great hall of the battle slain
With sword in hand.
Behold the kingdom of the kings
Books of spells and magic rings
Endless knowledge, endless time
I scream the final battle cry.

5. Hatred
I taste your blood as it showers from my blade
I eat your heart, from evil it was made
With heart filled hatred black blood runs through my veins.
I take your powers to the ancient ones who reign
I conquer evil, let evil know my name
Come forth ye wicked, know the gruesome pain
I am the omen, the one that cannot die
I am the flame, hatred burns inside.
My strength is hatred, torment and pain, HATRED, HATRED
With heart filled hatred black blood runs through my veins.
I crush your bones, I kill your face
I rip your flesh, I end the chase
You meet with terror, you draw the ace
I rule the world the rats that race.
My strength is hatred, torment and pain, HATRED, HATRED
With heart filled hatred black blood runs through my veins.
HATRED

6. Revelation (Death's Angel)
Above the wreckage of your mortal world I stand
Judgement passed delivered by his hand
Now clear the smoke, there the ashes stand
A fitting tribute to mortality and man.
What was written foretold in dreams,
in visions apocalypse now seen.
And all self-righteous fools who lived and blasphemed
Drink the wine of his anger
Die with the beast
Vindication, he is coming on the clouds
See his angels, hear their trumpets sound.
The day of anger when the stars fall from the sky
The moon turns red, the sun turns black as night.
Know the end is coming, heed this sign
By the morning star the four horsemen ride.
Revelation, the chosen saved
Earth be cleansed in a blaze
Armageddon, the first trumpet blows
Hail, fire and blood fall on Satan's throne.
His hair as white as wool, his eyes like burning flame
He is the first and last, he brings the seven plagues
Seven stars of seven cities in his hand
He holds the keys of death for the underworld and man
Know the end is coming, heed this sign
By the morning star he four horsemen ride
Revelation, the chosen saved
Earth be cleansed in a blaze
Armageddon, the first trumpet blows
Hail, fire and blood fall on Satan's throne.
Revelation, the chosen saved
Earth be cleansed in a blaze
Armageddon, the first trumpet blows
Hail, fire and blood fall on Satan's throne.

7. March For Revenge (By The Soldiers Of Death)
Ride, Ride, Ride, Ride Up From Hell
Armed with magic sons of demons and men
This song of greeting written for your tragic end.
So long our stride the world doth tremble with fear
Black winds blow where we ride near.
Maim and kill them, take the women and children.
Hot pitch and chain take to the air
Our ramming blades lay their ships hold bare.
Steel meets steel, axes, broadsword and shield.
Their heads ride our spears and bodies cover the fields.
Maim and kill them, take the women and children.
Fallen brother as I hold closed your side
I fear this wound your last.
Mighty earth now doth drink your blood
And I remember days long past.
Your sacrifice so great, rest now take thy sleep
For you shall not awake, let revenge be sweet.
For when we march, your sword rides with me.
For when we march, your sword rides with me.
For when we march, your sword rides with me.
For when we march, your sword rides with me.
You who killed my brother and all who take your side
This be your last hour. Let your steel be tried.
Now turn to face me upon the timeless plane
Kill me if you can.
Death is life!
By the full moon they rise from their graves.
Through seas of blood, fighting with hell bent rage.
Swear the creed of unity, by the circle of blood
We are one, we know not fear! Born to fight not run.
Maim and kill them, take the women and children.

MANOWAR LYRICS


1. Blood Of My Enemies
Three sons have I, and they
Ride by my side. The fierce,
The black, and the wicked are
their names-we ride down my
enemies on their half-hearted flight.
No voice of mercy-no evangels of light.

Mighty messengers-heathens rage
Witness our coming-gods of the dead.
I ride through the air-
I laugh as I die-with powers of evel
Dark knowledge is mine.
The ride of the wicked-
The firstst sin was trust.-
Kill without warning-for blood now
I lust

Strong wind-magic mist
To Asgard the Valkries fly
High overhead-they carry the dead
Where blood of my enemies lies.

Three sons have I,and they
Ride by my side.-The fierce,
The  black,and the wicked are
their names-we ride down my
enemies on their half-hearted flight.
No voice of mercy-no evangels of light.

Strong wind-magic mist
To Asgard the Valkries fly
High overhead-they carry the dead
Where blood of my enemies lies.

2. Each Dawn I Die
Passing through the storm-
Led by Demons-walk between the
World of men and gods-
Cast no shadows-draw no light.
I rape the priestess on pagans night.

I taste the serpents poison
On the lips of the one I love.
She brings this gift of witchcraft.
I wear the cat-skin-gloves.

Apples of youth when I wrought
Mischief,hung in a tree to rot
In the sun.-
Reborn in the middle of the
Final orgy the gift of slavery
To the chosen one.

Suicide Suicide don't you know
Me-call to the Master-he will
Come.-He will bring out
Ressurection-cloaked in darkness-
He has won.

Smoke of my sacrifice.-
Journey to the Isle of the
Blessed.-
Grant my soul your glory.
At night time-I'm your guest.
Only I know why-

Each dawn I die.

Smoke of my sacrifice.-
Journey to the Isle of the
Blessed.-
Grant my soul your glory.
At night time-I'm your guest.
Only I know why-

3. Kill With Power
Hear what's written on the wind.
We come to kill and kill again.
Our arrows fall like hail
Trample on the dead-Ride through the
Gate of clouds-stand on the open step

Run berserk-spreading fear and pain
Black shield and weapons, black our chain.
None can harm us-not their fire-
Iron or steel-for we have the
Will to power-with power we will
Kill

Kill with power-die die
Kill with power-die die

To the war god Odin you will pray
And the curse of weapons shell
Remain.On the blood of all our
Fathers-on their weapons we now
Swear to evenge-not lament.
Give the False ones death.

Kill with power-die die
Kill with power-die die

4. Hail To England
Raise sails head for the open sea
With sails full of wind-our hearts
Overflowwith belief.

The quest for the grail to England
We sail,with our steel.We
Bring what was lost.If
Lives are the cost,let it be.

Strong she stands-reaching her
Hand.Brave and grant.On English
Ground-we were born.Proudly
We return.-To English shore.

Hail,Hail to England-
Hail,Hail,Hail.

We march from the hills
Down to London Town.-
Join Raise you hand-or hide
When we ride for the crown.

Signs of the hammer and
The black winds blow through
The night.Long was out wait
Our meetings with Fate is tonight.

Strong she stands-reaching her
Hand.Brave and grand.On English
Ground-we were born.Proudly
We return.-To english shore.

Hail, Hail to England-
Hail,Hail,Hail.

Standind tall-one and all-
Light the hall.

Years have passed-I've dreamed
of this day.
As we raise our hands-we
proudly say.

Hail,Hail to England-
Hail,Hail,Hail.

5. Army Of The Immortals
Battle hymns did sound the call.
You came to our side.
You heard true metal
Into glory ride.
Come on yea

You stood beside us,
The false ones cries.
Your love is judgment,
You gave us life.
You wait in the rain, you walk through the snow.
We give you our blood, we want you to know.

In our eyes you're immortal
In our hearts you'll live forever
In our eyes you're immortal
In our hearts you'll live forever more.

We have read your letters, we have heard your call.
We were brought together 'cause we've got the balls
To play the loudest metal, so hard and wild and mean.
You'll live forever, we were born from your belief.

Metal makes us strong
Together we belong
Forever here's your song

We want you to know

In our eyes you're immortal
In our hearts you'll live forever
In our eyes you're immortal
In our hearts you'll live forever more

Metal makes us strong
Together we belong
Forever here's your song

We want you to know

In our eyes you're immortal
In our hearts you'll live forever
In our eyes you're immortal
In our hearts you'll live forever more

Metal makes us strong
It makes us
Metal makes us strong
It makes us stronger, stronger, stronger, stronger...
Stronger, metal makes us strong

6. Black Arrows
[spoken part:]
Let each note I now play
be a black arrow of death
sent straight to the hearts
of all those who play false metal

AH

[Instrumental]

7. Bridge Of Death
Slowly crossing as the river runs below
Never stopping for whats waiting soon will slow
And this last time looking back I'll see
My home for he awaits me reaching for my
soul.He calls my name,and waves me on
The fallen one he stands in flame

Well the life that he has given full of riches
And success has a price that I made good in
Blood to pay.And the light he now is showing
To guide my every footstep is insurance if
I falter on my way.And what God has now
Forsaken and man has never seen are the
Riches of the underworld below all my
Years of earthly pleasures gave support
Unto the briges I now cross it giving
Him my soul

Dark Lord,I summon thee demanging the
Sucred right to burn in hell,ride up to hells
hot wind.Face one more evilthan thou,take
My lustful soul,
Drink my blood as I drink yours,impale me on
the horns of death
Cut off my head release all my evel Lucifer is king
Praise Satan

I know the one who waits satan is
His name,is across the bridge of
Death there he stands in flame
I know the one who waits satan is
His name,is across the bridge of
Death there he stands in flame.

He is my provider as I walk into the
Void for eternity I give to him my soul
I shall do his bidding obey him
Without question even walk among the living if
I'm told

Satan don't forsake me I wait for
You take me grant me wings and as
You messenger I'll fly.

MANOWAR LYRICS


1. All Men Play On Ten
I made a rock-n-roll sin
When I tried giving in, to make money had to turn down loud
They said, "Why be proud, don't play so loud
Be like us and get a sound that's real thin
Wear a polyester suit, act happy, look cute, get a haircut
And buy small gear"
That's when I turned to them and said, hold it, right there

Well it's more to me than just a job, and while I'm playing
You won't get robbed
Nobody tells a man how to play, it just ain't that way
Hey, hey, hey, can you hear me say

All men play on ten, never gonna turn down again
All men play on ten, never gonna turn down again

I'm jet fuel honey, plug me in to 220, step back and let
My fingers fly
While I'm burning up my gear, there's a fire in your ear
That's won't stop until the day you die
I really put it to the floor when I hear the crowd roar
Oh, it's music to my ears when they scream
Then! Run back the power jack, and deck, all of my gear

Well it's more to me than just a job, and while I'm playing
You won't get robbed
Nobody tells a man how to play, it just ain't that way
Hey, hey, hey, can you hear me say

All men play on ten, never gonna turn down again
All men play on ten, never gonna turn down again

Well it's more to me than just a job, and while I'm playing
You won't get robbed
Nobody tells a man how to play, it just ain't that way
Hey, hey, hey, can you hear me say

All men play on ten, never gonna turn down again
All men play on ten, never gonna turn down again

2. Animals
Hear the call of the wild in us all
It waits for the night to fall
I'm getting hot, I'm ready for the night
No holdin' back, let's ball
I'm gonna give all you can take all night
And leave you in the morning feeling right

I'm an animal, there's an animal in me
Gonna set it free
I'm an animal, there's an animal in me
Gonna set it free

I've been looking, you've been watching the side
There's somethings you just can't hide
Oh, your getting wet, your working up a sweat
Your hairs standing up on end
Your skin is screaming, glad we met?
Tonight's one night you won't forget

I'm an animal, there's an animal in me
Gonna set it free
I'm an animal, there's an animal in me
Gonna set it free

3. Thor (The Powerhead)
Black clouds on the horizon
Great thunder and burning rain
His chariot pounding, I heard the heavens scream his name

I watched as he shouted
To the giants that died that day
He held up his hammer high and called Odin for a sign

Thor the mighty, Thor the brave
Crush the infidels in your way
By your hammer let none be saved
Live to die on that final day
Gods, monsters and men
We'll die together in the end

God of thunder, God of rain
Earth shaker who feels no pain
The powerhead of the universe
Now send your never ending curse

I watched as he shouted
To the giants that died that day
He held up his hammer high and called Odin for a sign

Thor the mighty, Thor the brave
Crush the infidels in your way
By your hammer let none be saved
Live to die on that final day
Gods, monsters and men
We'll die together in the end

Swing your hammer to crack the sky
Lift your cape so that you might fly
Back to Odin and gods on high
And leave this mortal world

Thor the mighty, Thor the brave
Crush the infidels in your way
By your hammer let none be saved
Live to die on that final day
Gods, monsters and men
We'll die together in the end
Odin

4. Mountains
So tall, silent against the sky
Up through the clouds, where eagles fly
Wind and rain beat down on one so strong
They cut but never change, what stood so long

Tall  as a mountain, I'm gonna tear through the sky
Life's for the taking
Like a man is a mountainside
Greatness waits for those who try
None can teach you, it's all inside
Just climb

I'm in the ground, I'm in the air, I'm all
I live in the hearts of all men
I'm the call to greatness
Not all can hear
I awaken the creator, in those who dare
And the day will come, when we all must die
And enter the mountainside

Tall as a mountain, I'm gonna tear through the sky
Life's for the taking
Like a man is a mountainside
Greatness waits for those who try
None can teach you, it's all inside
Just climb

I have no fear
Death and glory
Both draw near
Like a man is a mountainside
Greatness waits for those who try
None can teach you, it's all inside
Just climb

5. Sign Of The Hammer
The spell has been broken, the curse has been lifted
Black is the wind on the heels of the gifted
Four sworn to vengeance, see the hate in our eyes
Called by the gods and given a sign

Onward pounding into glory ride
Sign of the hammer, be my guide
Final warning all stand aside
Sign of the hammer, it's my time

Pounding, pounding, we are back from the dead
Those who denied us are delivered instead
Into the hands of four sworn to ride
Now the people will triumph and live by the sign

Onward pounding into glory ride
Sign of the hammer, be my guide
Final warning all stand aside
Sign of the hammer, it's my time

The spell has been broken, the curse has been lifted
Black is the wind on the heels of the gifted
Four sworn to vengeance, see the hate in our eyes
Called by the gods and given a sign

Onward pounding into glory ride
Sign of the hammer, be my guide
Final warning all stand aside
Old man and young boys, it's my time
Sign of the hammer, it's my time

6. The Oath
Burning embers of the second death will come in the night
Priests and kings, the alpha and omega, poison bites
False prophets and deceivers, swing from the trees
Now dawn the age of birds
Drunk with blood, like lepers with disease

Lord of the sky, mercury the guide
Lord of the underworld, I swear the sacred rite
I will crucify, slay them with their tribe
Hear my war cry

They'll find no sanctuary hidden in their ancestral halls
Let loose the knot that binds
The spirit and flesh, let it fall
For only courage and heroism linger after death
So, hold fast thy sword, rejecting pain, feel the dragons breath

Lord of the sky, mercury the guide
Lord of the underworld, I swear the sacred rite
I will crucify, slay them with their tribe
Hear my war cry

I've sworn the oath
I've sworn the oath
I've sworn the oath

Lord of the sky, mercury the guide
Lord of the underworld, I swear the sacred rite
I will crucify, slay them with their tribe
Hear my war cry

Burning embers of the second death will come in the night
Priests and kings, the alpha and omega, poison bites
False prophets and deceivers, swing from the trees
Now dawn the age of birds
Drunk with blood, like lepers with disease

Lord of the sky, mercury the guide
Lord of the underworld, I swear the sacred rite
I will crucify, slay them with their tribe
Hear my war cry

I've sworn the oath
I've sworn the oath
I've sworn the oath

7. Guyana (Cult Of The Damned)
Thank you for the kool aid reverend jim
We're glad to leave behind their world of sin
Our lifeless bodies fall on holy ground
Rotting flesh a sacrificial mound

Were you our God or a man in a play who took our applause and forced us to stay
Now all together we lived as we dead on your command by your side

Guyana – in the cult of the damned
Give us your word for the grand final stand
Guyana – in the cult of the damned
Give us your word for the grand final stand

In the cult of the damned we all worked the land, too afraid to look up
We all feared his hand
Hurry my children
There isn't much time
But we'll meet again on the other side
Be good to the children and old people
First hand them a drink
They're dying of thirst

Guyana – in the cult of the damned
Give us your word for the grand final stand
Guyana – in the cult of the damned
Give us your word for the grand final stand
Guyana – in the cult of the damned
Give us your word for the grand final stand
Guyana – in the cult of the damned
Give us your word for the grand final stand

Bigfoot, bigfoot thrown in a well
Pulled under water
Screaming like hell
He told us life was just a hotel
Time to check out when he rang the bell

Guyana – in the cult of the damned
Give us your word for the grand final stand
Guyana – in the cult of the damned
Give us your word for the grand final stand
Mother, mother.

1. Achilles, Agony, And Ecstasy (In Eight Parts)
[PRELUDE]

[I HECTOR STORMS THE WALL]

I see my chariot run to your ships
I'll drive you back to the sea
You came here for gold
The wall will not hold
This day was promised to me
The gods are my shield
My fate has been sealed
Lightning and javelins fly
Soon many will fall
We are storming the wall
Stones fall snow from the sky
We will pay with our glory
In the fire of battle
Zeus today is mine
Killing all my way
Like sheep and like cattle
Smashing skulls of all who defy
I spare not the hammer
I spare not the sword
This day will ring with my name
None have to chase me
Let he who will face me
Kill me or die by the sword

[II THE DEATH OF PATROCLUS]

Oh friend of mine, how to say goodbye
This was your time, but the armor you wore
Was mine, I will not rest
Until Hector's blood is spilled
His bones will all be broken
Dragged across the field
This dear friend is how we'll say goodbye
Until we meet in the sky

[III FUNERAL MARCH]

[IV ARMOR OF THE GODS]

[V HECTOR'S FINAL HOUR]

Here is inside the walls Troy, the gods weigh my fate
From this day do I abstain, to a memory of hate
To pay for all the blood that spilled
The many thousands I did kill,
No walls can contain the gods' almighty will
I hear the silent voices I cannot hide
The gods leaves no choices so we all must die
Oh Achilles let thy arrows fly.
Into the wind, where eagles cross the sky
Today my mortal blood will mix with sand
It was foretold I will die by thy hand
Into Hades my soul descend

[VI DEATH HECTOR'S REWARD]

Cowards in the grip of fear, no valour to uphold
Cut into the earth, with honor long been sold
For all shall come to know me
As they fall unto their knees
Zeus the Thunderer, control my destiny
When the cards of life were dealt,
My hand a ruthless fate
To avenge, and bringeth fury, Hector feel my hate
A bloodbath was born to bring, by birth I'm an assassin
To cut the cord of life and beath,
Ties to earth unfasten
Blood and fire death and hate, your body I will desecrate
Dogs and vultures eat your flesh the hall of Hades waits
Kill...
Hector's blood lies on the battlefield
His body lies on the battlefield
His body's mangled wounds,
The gods who once protected him are now his gods of doom,
Like a tower standing tall, steadfest in direction
I fall upon you bringing death, the gods give no protection
Coward in the grip of fear, no valour to uphold
Cut into the earth, with honor long been sold
For all shall come to know me, as they fall ino their knees
Zeus the Thunderer, control my destiny
Blood and fire death and hate, you body I will desecrate
Dogs and vultures eat your flesh the hall of Hades waits
Die, die, die...

[VII THE DESECRATION OF HECTOR'S BODY]
[PART 1]
[PART 2]

[VIII THE GLORY OF ACHILLES]

The oath of the gods, this day was fulfilled
In the heat of the battle, Hector was killed
See him Patroclus, down in the dust
Rejoice in his death my symbol of trust
A dozen highborn youths, have been killed
Cutting their throats their blood was all spilled
Their bodies set at the fool of your fire
With oxen, sheep and two of your hounds
Your funeral pyre high off the ground
Hector's body dragged three times around
I will carry the torch to your funeral pyre
I will ask of the wind to send high your fire
Hector's blood will not be washed from my body until your body is burned
A prophecy spoken a promice fulfilled
More blood will be spilled, more will be killed.

2. Metal Warriors (Brothers Of Metal Pt. I)
Every one of us has heard the call
Brothers of True Metal proud and standing tall
We know the power within us has brought us to this hall
There's magic in the metal there's magic is us all

Heavy metal or no metal at all wimps and posers leave the hall
Heavy metal or no metal at all wimps and posers go on get out
Leave the hall

Now the world must listen to our decree
We don't turn down for anyone we do just what we please
Got to make it louder, all men play on ten
If you're not into metal, you are not my friend

Heavy metal or no metal at all wimps and posers leave the hall
Heavy metal or no metal at all wimps and posers I said
Leave the hall

Now the world must listen to our decree
We don't turn down for anyone we do just what we please
Got to make it louder, all men play on ten
If you're not into metal, you are not my friend

There's metal in the air tonight, can you hear it call
If you ain't got the balls, to take it you can
Leave the hall

Heavy metal or no metal at all wimps and posers leave the hall
Heavy metal or no metal at all wimps and posers leave the hall

3. Ride The Dragon
Demon's blood and dragon fire, falling on my wings
Racing to the battle in the sky
Ancient gods are calling me I hear them when they sing
Of all the heroes who wait for me to die

Beneath the cloak of magic, I'll meet them in the air
I am invisible, I move without a sound
They look but cannot find me, they think that I'm not there
With a spell I send them crashing to the ground

Wait for me dragon, we'll meet in the sky by fire and magic I am sworn
Hell is calling! We cannot be denied fly to the blackness of the storm
We must die to be reborn

I wear a sacred talisman, I make a secret sign
Now welcome me into this wicked wind
On the journey of a shaman a dragon I must ride
The gates of hell are open! Let me in!

Rule in hell or serve in heaven choose an altar or throne
All Commandments and the laws of man disown
Now eat the fruit of knowledge unto no one ye atone
Into the fire with your soul!

Wait for me dragon, we'll meet in the sky by fire and magic I am sworn
Hell is calling! We cannot be denied fly to the blackness of the storm
We must die to be reborn

Demon's blood and dragon fire, falling on my wings Racing to the battle in the sky
Ancient gods are calling me I hear them when they sing
Of all the heroes who wait for me to die

Beneath the cloak of magic, I'll meet them in the air
I am invisible, I move without a sound
They look but cannot find me, they think that I'm not there
With a spell I send them crashing to the ground

Wait for me dragon, we'll meet in the sky by fire and magic I am sworn
Hell is calling! We cannot be denied fly to the blackness of the storm
We must die to be reborn

4. Spirit Horse Of The Cherokee
The trail of tears began for all the Cherokee
The white men came to trade & borrow but then they would not leave
Some of us were taken by boat, and died at sea
Those of us who lived were sold to slavery

We welcomed them as brothers knowing nothing of their greed
Born hunters not the hunted as the white man hunts for me
We are descendants of the animals we live among the free
Our trail of tears would end one day at Wounded Knee.

Great Spirit, thunder birds fly, we are wild and free
To fight and die by the open sky, Spirit Horse ride for me

When we do the Ghost Dance, the buffalo will return
Paint ourselves for war, now blood and fire burn
Great Spirit makes us strong, take us to the sky
The Cherokee are brave, we are not afraid to die

Great Spirit, thunder birds fly, we are wild and free
To fight and die by the open sky, Spirit Horse ride for me

Red Cloud, Black Hawk, Sitting Bull, Crazy Horse, Geronimo
Strong and brave warriors to the grave

There has been much killing there will be much more
The Medicine Man is dancing he's calling us to war,
Hatchets sing with pride let the white men die

Great Spirit, thunder birds fly, we are wild and free
To fight and die by the open sky, Spirit Horse ride for me

5. Burning
We have come from the ashes of the burning away
Pouring blood in the fire on the altar of pain
Led into temptation, now the black gods align
Here there is no salvation and your blood is my wine.

Here's a world that is waiting between the living and the dead
Here the flesh and its pleasure are eternally wed
All is all for the taking for a life of a lie
At the end of the breaking I'll be watching you die.

Crawl to the silence renounce and deny,
The stars and the numbers foretold of this time,
To the words and the wisdom too the promise of lies
By their anger and fury the strong will survive.

6. The Power Of Thy Sword
Lord of battle I pray on bended knee conquest by the rising sun
I'll wait for thy command with flame and blood at hand
glory and a broken sword.

I'm the master of the world I have no fear of man or beast
Born inside the soul of the world
Riding hard breaking bone with steel and stone
Eternal might I was born to wield.

Let us drink to the battles we've lived and we've fought
Celebrate the pain and havoc we have wrought
Great heroes charge into the fight
From the north to the south in the black of night

The clash of honor calls to stand when others fall
Gods of war feel the power of my sword

Drink to the battles we've lived and we've fought
Celebrate the pain and havoc we have wrought
Great heroes charge into the fight
From the north to the south in the black of night

Fierce is my blade fierce is my hate born to die in battle
I laugh at my fate
Now pay in blood when your blood has been spilled
You're never forgiven death is fulfilled !

The clash of honor calls to stand when others fall
Gods of war feel the power of my sword

The clash of honor calls
I will stand when others fall
Open magic doors
The will know the power of my sword

There is blood in my hands there is blood in my eyes
With blood in my voice I scream as you die
Thirsting for vengeance and mounds of the slain
Shaking the forest onto the plain

Fierce is my blade fierce is my hate born to die in battle
I laugh at my fate
Now pay in blood when your blood has been spilled
You're never forgiven death is fulfilled !

The clash of honor calls to stand when others fall
Gods of war feel the power of my sword

7. The Demon's Whip
Black candles slowly burning, white fangs and flashing eyes
Hell's wind and incantations summon living fire,
Darkest forces and your demon's black order, black king
The cult that serves the living, accept this offering

Black candles slowly burning, white fangs and flashing eyes
Hell's wind and incantations summon living fire,
As the seven steps await, hear the great bell toll
With a dead man's bones conjure, the enemy of the soul

From the misery and sadness, of the molten seas of hell
Mystic love and mystic symbols in evil dreams there dwell
Darkest forces and your demon's black order, black king
The cult that serves the living, accept this offering

A deadly drink, a meal of hearts, now sacrifice and die
In darkness and destruction, behold the evil eye
And the Demon's whip

Armies of the gods of hell ride across the astral plane
Bearing curses of destruction, sworn beyond the grave
Children of the darkness, all born but to deceive
By the ancient code of evil grant not one reprieve

In the place where evil dwells death can live when all life dies
Wage eternal war on heaven immortal hate below the sky
Your scripture and your sermons, are leaves born on the wind
To heal the unrepentant one needs a greater sin

Night winds, Oblivion see my dark desire
Come forth, appear he is living fire
Feel the Demon's whip

Armies of the gods of hell ride across the astral plane
Bearing curses of destruction, sworn beyond the grave
Children of the darkness, all born but to deceive
By the ancient code of evil grant not one reprieve

In the place where evil dwells death can live when all life dies
Wage eternal war on heaven immortal hate below the sky
Your scripture and your sermons, are leaves borne on the wind
To heal the unrepentant one needs a greater sin
Feel the Demon's whip

8. Master Of The Wind
In the silence of the darkness when all are fast asleep
I live inside a dream calling to your spirit
As a sail calls the wind, hear the angels sing

Far beyond the sun across the western sky
Reach into the blackness find a silver line
In a voice I whisper a candle in the night
We'll carry all our dreams in a single beam of light

Close your eyes, look into the dream
Winds of change will winds of fortune bring

Fly away to a rainbow in the sky gold is at the end for each of us to find
There the road begins where another one will end
Here the four winds know who will break and who will bend
All to be the master of the wind

Falling stars now light my way
My life was written on the wind
Clouds above, clouds below
High ascend the dreams within

When the wind fills the sky the clouds will move aside
And there will be the road to all our dreams
For any day that stings two better days it brings

Nothing is as bad as it seems
Close your eyes, look into the dream
Wins of change will winds of fortune bring

Fly away to a rainbow in the sky gold is at the end for each of us to find
There the road begins where another one will end
Here the four winds know who will break and who will bend
All to be the master of the wind

2. Blow Your Speakers
Wrote a letter to the M.T.V.
What's goin' on now
Don't ya care about me ?
Send the same letter to the radio, Ha!
But my party went dead
Like a shot in the head

We all like it - Rock And Roll
We all want it - on your show
Play it loud  don't play it low
Blow Your Speakers with Rock And Roll

We got lots of stations
Around the nation
And the stuff they're playin'
It just ain't worth sayin'
People want music to get'em movin'
We don't want labels
We want music on the cable

3. Carry On
The north star always guides me
When winter skies are gray
And I wait for the sun when all ate one
I shall not betray
Calling at me
I'm waiting when all are led astray

Carry On my sons forever
Carry On when I am gone
Carry On for when the day is long
Forever Carry On
For as long as we together
Then forever Carry On

Darkness all around us
We don't close our eyes
No one's gonna ground us
We were born to fly
Comin' at us no stopping
Born to amplify

Carry On my sons forever
Carry On when I am gone
Carry On for when the day is long
Forever Carry On
For as long as we together
Then forever Carry On

Yea, be my brother
Fight to stay alive
All the world can't change us
With all their burned-out jive
Come get us now we're waiting
We won't ride and hide

Carry On my sons forever
Carry On when I am gone
Carry On for when the day is long
Forever Carry On
For as long as we together
Then forever Carry On

Now we're all together
Let's sing a fighting song
One hundred thousand riders
We can't all be wrong
Comin' at us no stopping
Always Carry On

Carry On my sons forever
Carry On when I am gone
Carry On for when the day is long
Forever Carry On
For as long as we together
Then forever Carry On

4. Violence And Bloodshed
Civilization crumblin' fast
End the world with a blast
People afraid walkin' the streets
Scums have their day
'Til they run into me

Are you ready ?

Livin' in fear ain't livin to me
I'm armed with a gun defending the free
They blew it in 'Nam
Shot up my friends
I'm back in the street
The fight never ends
I was born with a gun in my hand
I'll die for my country
But I'll die like a man

Violence and Bloodshed
Violence and Bloodshed
Violence and Bloodshed

Now that we're back to animal law
The payback's a bitch
I'm paying all
All my life I been waitin' to see
Who's gonna win, crumbs or me

Are you ready ?

My brother's still in Da-Nang
Puttin' an ad in the back of Kerrang
I'm lookin' for people who just wanna kill
We'll go back to 'Nam 'cause no one else win

Land of the free
Home of the brave
Now that's how it is
And that's how it stays

Violence and Bloodshed
Violence and Bloodshed
Violence and Bloodshed

5. Defender
When you are old enough to read these words
Their meaning will unfold
These words are all that's left
And though we've never met, my only son
I hope you know
That I would have been there to watch you grow
But my call was heard and I did go
Now your mission lies ahead of you
As it did my so long ago
To help the helpless ones who all look up to you
And to defend them to the end

Defender

Ride like the wind
Fight proud, my son
You're the defender
God has sent

Father,father,father
I look up to you and heed thy call

This letter ends my search
I'll live your dream now passed on to me
And I now wait to shake the hand of fate
Like the dusk awaiting dawn
So wizards cast your spell
With no heart to do me well
So it is written, it shall be

Defender

Ride like the wind
Fight proud, my son
You're the defender
God has sent

6. Drums Of Doom
Damnation, Religion
Salvation, Fire Ad Steel

7. Holy War
I have seen the fire
Of the thousands suns pass by
While blasphemers spread their Gospel
Bearing false witness
Now we rise
All ye children of the wild
Fists like hammers fill the air
Vast legions all immortal
Smash the stillness everywhere

Holy, Holy War

Holy
We are fighting, fighting a Holy War
Holy War
See us fly on winds of doom
Holy War
Baptized in Fire and Steel
Holy War
For the end we bring is soon
Holy War
Now face the storm
A Holy War

Brothers of metal know no masters
Metal's our religion
Take it to the grave
Rulers of the earth
Our dawn of glory
All reborn we live again
Hold true, ye sacred army
Our last battle is at hand
Sweep this dogs from our kingdom
Bless this ground, our holy land

Holy, Holy War

Holy
We are fighting, fighting a Holy War
Holy War
See us fly on winds of doom
Holy War
Baptized in Fire and Steel
Holy War
For the end we bring is soon
Holy War
Now face the storm
A Holy War

8. Master Of Revenge
Black Dogs howl in the night
The Lion is dead!
A Solitary Messenger
The Master of Revenge

9. Black Wind, Fire And Steel
Full moon's light is calling me
My kingdom lies within
The mystic soul and lion's heart
Brought by the talisman.
The ecstasy of battle takes me
Where the falcons fly.
Immortal youth was granted me
I will never die.

Born of Black Wind, Fire and Steel
Born of Black Wind, Fire and Steel
Born to teach them all to heel
Black Wind, Fire and Steel.

Pounded by the hammers
Of the giants of the world.
I can see in darkness,
I'm the overlord
Single combat I await
My shadow brings them fear.
The spikes upon my chariot
Will grind them when they're near.

Born of Black Wind, Fire and Steel
Born of Black Wind, Fire and Steel
Born to teach them all to heel
Black Wind, Fire and Steel.

I am an outcast
On the path of no return.
Punisher and swordsman
I was born to burn.
Black Wind always follows
Where my black horse rides.
Fire's in my soul
Steel is on my side.

Born of Black Wind, Fire and Steel
Born of Black Wind, Fire and Steel
Born to teach them all to heel
Black Wind, Fire and Steel.

I am an outcast
On the path of no return.
Punisher and swordsman
I was born to burn.
Black Wind always follows
Where my black horse rides.
Fire's in my soul
Steel is on my side.

Born of Black Wind, Fire and Steel
Born of Black Wind, Fire and Steel
Born to teach them all to heel
Black Wind, Fire and Steel.

MANOWAR LYRICS


1. Wheels Of Fire
[Joey DeMaio]

Since the dawn of time
I've rolled across the earth
Snipping in the dust
Long before your birth
Eatin'tar and gasoline
Every light I see is green
Open pipes, my machines's triple-plated chrome

Spirit of the wheel

Wheels of fire burn the night
Ride across the sky
Wheels of fire burning bright
We live to ride

Motors running
Now you're gonna learn
Waiting on the line
Make your tires burn
Fast, faster, faster, faster
Speeding always kills
Nothing else takes us to get these thrills

Spirit of the wheel

Wheels of fire burn the night
Ride across the sky
Wheels of fire burning bright
We live to ride

Blood and thunder on the road
My heart is pounding
My blood is nitroglycerin
I'm fire
Burning, burning, burning, burning
Ready to explode
Don't want nothing left of me to scrape off the road

Spirit of the wheel

Wheels of fire burn the night
Ride across the sky
Wheels of fire burning bright
We live to ride

Clouds of smoke
Tires screaming
Fire in my hair
blown into a thousand pieces
Scattered everywhere
Fast, burn, burning, faster
Wanna take a ride
Spirit of the wheel
Wheels of fire ride
Spirit of the wheel

Wheels of fire burn the night
Ride across the sky
Wheels of fire burning bright
We live to ride

2. Kings Of Metal
[Joey DeMaio,Ross The Boss]

Manowar Manowar living on the road
When we're in town speakers explode
We don't attract wimps 'cause we're too loud
Just true metal people that's Manowar's crowd

They wanna keep us down
But they can't last
When we get up we're gonna kick your ass
Gonna keep on burnin'
We always will
Other bands play Manowar kill
Other bands play Manowar kill

We like it hard, we like it fast
We got the biggest amps, man they blast
True metal people wanna rock not pose
Wearin' jeans and leather, not cracker jack clothes

They wanna keep us down
But they can't last
When we get up we're gonna kick your ass
Gonna keep on burnin'
We always will
Other bands play Manowar kill
Other bands play Manowar kill

We're the kings of metal comin' to town
When we light up, have the roof nailed down
Don't try to tell us that we're too loud
'Cause there ain't no way that we'll ever turn down

They wanna keep us down
But they can't last
When we get up we're gonna kick your ass
Gonna keep on burnin'
We always will
other bands play Manowar kill

3. Heart Of Steel
[Joey DeMaio]

Build a fire a thousand miles away to light my long way home
I ride a comet
My trail is long to stay
Silence is a heavy stone...
I fight the world and take all they can give
There are times my heart hangs low
Born to walk against the wind
Born to hear my name
No matter where I stand I'm alone

Stand and fight
Live by your heart
Always one more try
I'm not afraid to die
Stand and fight
say what you feel
Born with a heart of steel

Burn the bridge behind you
Leave no retreat
There's only one way home
Those who laugh and crowd the path
And cut each other's throats
Will fall like melting snow
They'll watch us rise with fire in our eyes
They'll bow their heads
Their hearts will hang low
Then we'll laugh and they will kneel
And know this heart of steel was
Too hard to break
Too hard to hold

Stand and fight
Live by your heart
Always one more try
I'm not afraid to die
Stand and fight
Say what you feel
born with a heart of steel

4. Sting Of The Bumblebee
[Instrumental]

5. The Crown And The Ring (Lament Of The Kings)
[Joey DeMaio]

From a battle I've come
To a battle I ride
Blazing up to the sky
Chains of fate
Hold a fiery stride
I'll see you again when I die

High and mighty alone we are kings
Whirlwinds of fire we ride
Providence brought us the crown and the ring
Covered with blood and our pride

Heroes await me
My enemies ride fast
Knowing not this ride's their last
Saddle my horse as I drink my last ale
Bow string and steel will prevail

High and mighty alone we are kings
Whirlwinds of fire we ride
Providence brought us the crown and the ring
Covered with blood and our pride

Odin I await thee
Your true son am I
I hail you now as I die
I pledge you my sword and to no man I kneel
Ours is the Kingdom Of Steel

High and mighty alone we are kings
Whirlwinds of fire we ride
Providence brought us the crown and the ring
Covered with blood and our pride

6. Kingdom Come
[Joey DeMaio]

See the white light
The light within
Be your own disciple
Fan the sparks of will
For all of us waiting
Our kingdom will come
Rays of power shining
Rays of magic fall
On the golden voice that speaks within us all
For all of us waiting
Your kingdom will come
Kingdom Come

Feel the white light
The light within
Yea it burns a fire that drives a man to win
For all of us waiting
Your kingdom will come

Kingdom Come

Words of power
Calling to us all
Holding us together while other kingdoms fall
No longer waiting
Our kingdom has come

Kingdom Come

Kingdom coming
Another kingdom falls
The rightful are waiting
But all are not rightful
Wait and receive the weight of the fall

Kingdom Come

7. Hail And Kill
[Joey DeMaio,Ross The Boss]

Brothers I am calling from the valley of the kings
With nothing to atone
A dark march lies ahead, together we will ride
Like thunder from the sky
May your sword stay wet like a young girl in her prime
Hold your hammers high

Blood and death are waiting like a raven in the sky
I was born to die
Hear me while I live
As I look into your eyes
None shall hear a lie
Power and dominion are taken by the will
By divine right hail and kill

Hail, Hail, Hail, Hail and Kill, Hail and Kill
Hail, Hail, Hail, Hail and Kill, Hail and Kill

My father was a wolf
I'm a kinsman of the slain
Sworn to rise again
I will bring salvation, punishment and pain
The hammer of hate is our faith
Power and dominion are taken by the will
By divine right hail and kill
Hail, Hail, Hail, Hail and Kill, Hail and Kill
Hail, Hail, Hail, Hail and Kill, Hail and Kill

Rip their flesh
Burn their hearts
Stab them in the eyes
Rape their women as they cry
Kill their servants
Burn their homes
Till there's no blood left to spill
Hail and Kill
Power and dominion are taken by the will
By divine right hail and kill

Hail, Hail, Hail, Hail and Kill, Hail and Kill

8. The Warriors Prayer
- Grandfather, tell me a story !
- Alright, go and get your storybook
- No, no, not one of those, a real story !
- A real story ?
- Yes, tell me about when you were a boy.
- Well, then I shall have to take you back
with me, a long way in time...

It was my thirteenth year on a cold winter's
day, as I walked through the enchanted forest,
I heard the sound of horses and men at arms,
I felt compelled to walk on and find the place
of these sounds, and when the forest did clear
I was standing on a hill. Before me, (there?)
was a great plain. Upon it, the armies of the
world, standing, waiting. I thought to myself,
for whom or for what are they waiting ?
Suddenly a gust of wind came up from the north.
There appeared a lone rider, holding a sword
of steel. Then from the south came another,
bearing a battle ax. From the east came a third,
holding a spiked club. And finally, from the west,
a rider who wielded a great hammer of war.
With them came their soldiers of death, followed
by an army of immortals. They were few in number,
but the look in their eyes told all who beheld
them that they would leave this day only in
victory or death. And there was a great silence...

My heart began to pound, storm clouds filled
the sky with darkness, rain came, and the four
winds blew with such anger that I held fast to
a tree. I watched the four riders raise their
weapons into the air. Without warning, screaming
their war cry. They led the attack, down to
the battle they rode. They met the armies of
the world with a mighty clash ! I could feel
the ground shake, the earth drank much blood
that day ! Each of the four, was unto himself,
a whirlwind of doom !!!!!!!!!!
When the smoke did clear, many thousands
were dead. There was much blood and gore.
Their bodies lay broken and scattered across
the battlefield, like brown leaves blown by
the wind. And I saw the four ride together
to the top of the hill, while below them the
soldiers of death assembled, all those who
would now swear allegiance to them. And the
four spoke the words of the warriors prayer...

Gods of war I call You. My sword is by my side.
I seek a life of honor, free from all false pride.
I will crack the whip with a bold mighty hail.
Cover me with death if I should ever fail.

Glory, Majesty, Unity
Hail, Hail, Hail

And as I stood and looked on, I heard the
armies of the world hail them without end, and
their voices of victory carried long and far
throughout the land !

- Well that's it. Did you like the story ?
- Yeah, it was great !
- Oh Good, I'm glad. Now off to bed with you.
- Grandfather ?
- Yes ?
- Who were those four men ?
- Who were they ? They were the Metal Kings !!!!!!

9. Blood Of The Kings
[Joey DeMaio]

Brothers the battle is raging
Choose your side
Sing with us the Battle Hymns
Into Glory Ride
Hail to England
The sign of the hammer's our guide
Forever we're Fighting the World
Side by side

On a crusade
The world we bring
Four Kings of Metal
Four Metal Kings
Death to the false ones
Dance on a string
'Til the blood on your sword is the blood of a king
'Til the blood on your hand is the blood of a king

Our armies in England, Ireland, Scotland and Wales
Our brothers in Belgium, Holland and France
Will not fail
Denmark, Sweden, Norway, Finland, Italy
Switzerland, Austria
Back to the Glory of Germany

On a crusade
The world we bring
Four Kings of Metal
Four Metal Kings
Death to the false ones
Dance on a string
'Til the blood on your sword is the blood of a king
'Til the blood on your hand is the blood of a king

Sound the Death Tone
On our March for Revenge
Spill the Blood of my Enemies
The Oath of a Friend
Fight the Holy War for The Crown and the Ring
Six magic circles made by the Blood of the Kings

Wherever we ride it's metal we bring
Four Kings of Metal
Four Metal Kings
Death to the false ones
Dance on a string
'Til the blood on your sword is the blood of a king
'Til the blood on your hand is the blood of a king
Blood of a king.

10. Pleasure Slave
[bonus track]

She Is Waiting To Kiss My Hand
But She Will Wait For My Command
My Chains And Collar Brought Her To Her Knees
She Now Is Free To Please
Woman Be My Slave
That's Your Reason To Live
Woman Be My Slave
The Greatest Gift I Can Give
Woman Be My Slave
Before Her Surrender She Had No Life
Now She's A Slave Not A Wife
Her Only Sorrow Is For Women Who Live With Lies
She's Taken Off Her Disguise
Woman Be My Slave
Chained Unto My Bed
Woman Be My Slave
Begging To Be Fed
Your Body Belongs To Me
Woman Come Here
Remove Your Garments
Kneel Before Me
Please Me
Woman Be My Slave
Chained Unto My Bed
Woman Be My Slave
Begging To Be Fed
I Want You Now
Woman Be My Slave

[German version of "Heart Of Steel" off the album "Kings Of Metal"]

Ein Feuer brennt
1000 Meilen weg,
Zeig mir den Weg zum Ziel.

Ich reit' Kometen,
Mein Weg ist lang und schwer,
Schweigen ist die schwerste Last.

Kaempf gegen die Welt,
Nimm alles, was es gibt,
Manchmal verlier auch ich.

Geboren um gegen den Wind zu gehen,
Geboren um zu verlieren,
Wohin ich geh', geh' ich allein.

Schlag' die Schlacht,
Leb wie Du willst.
Ich kenn' keine Not
Und keine Angst vor'm Tod.
Schlag' die Schlacht,
Du hast die Wahl,
Ich hab' ein Herz aus Stahl.

Geh den Weg nur vorwaerts,
Lasse nichts zurueck,
Es gibt nur eine Chance.

Die jetzt lachen und sich freu'n,
Werden es noch seh'n,
Sie werd'n wie Schnee vergeh'n.

Wir werden geh'n als ein starkes Heer,
Sie beugen das Haupt,
Ihr Mut geht dahin.

Dann lachen wir, vorbei die Qual
und seht das Herz aus Stahl,
zu hart fuer euch - zu hart fuer euch.

Schlag' die Schlacht,
Leb wie Du willst.
Ich kenn' keine Not
Und keine Angst vor'm Tod.
Schlag' die Schlacht,
Du hast die Wahl,
Ich hab' ein Herz aus Stahl.

Ich hab' ein Herz aus Stahl.
Schlag' die Schlacht,
Du hast die Wahl,
Ich hab' ein Herz aus Stahl.

Schlag' die Schlacht,
Leb wie Du willst.
Ich kenn' keine Not
Und keine Angst vor'm Tod.
Schlag' die Schlacht,
Du hast die Wahl,
Ich hab' ein Herz aus Stahl.

13. Kingdom Come
[Joey DeMaio]

See the white light
The light within
Be your own disciple
Fan the sparks of will
For all of us waiting
Our kingdom will come
Rays of power shining
Rays of magic fall
On the golden voice that speaks within us all
For all of us waiting
Your kingdom will come
Kingdom Come

Feel the white light
The light within
Yea it burns a fire that drives a man to win
For all of us waiting
Your kingdom will come

Kingdom Come

Words of power
Calling to us all
Holding us together while other kingdoms fall
No longer waiting
Our kingdom has come

Kingdom Come

Kingdom coming
Another kingdom falls
The rightful are waiting
But all are not rightful
Wait and receive the weight of the fall

Kingdom Come

MANOWAR LYRICS


1. Return Of The Warlord
Now the time has come when all is said and done
We're back together on the road it's time to fly
No more time to wait you know it feels so great
Wearin leather on a horse of steel I ride
I ain't waiting to get old I'm runnin hot I'm never cold
Kiss my ass if you don't like me I don't care
I got my wheels I got my friends we're on the road again
We're all crazy gonna ride until we die

Time to burn you losers better learn
No one controls our goddamn lifes
We'll do just what we feel riding horses made of steel
We're here to burn up the night

Losers try to put us down it's just another day
I got no money or big house just got life
I don't like to save it's more fun to spend
If you like metal you're my friend
And that bike out in the yard well that's my wife
Don't try to understand me my family never will
Had to punch my teacher out now he's chilled
I might stay in school or die in prison
Either way it's my decision one more beer and heavy metal
And I'm just fine

Time to burn you losers better learn
No one controls our goddamn lifes
We'll do just what we feel riding horses made of steel
We're here to burn up the night

We are the undefeated we're not living in the past
We're here tonight to kick some goddamn ass
Feel the power of the wheel lets drink to riding steel
Livin hard and ridin fast

Time to burn you losers better learn
No one controls our goddam lifes
We'll do just what we feel riding horses made of steel
We're here to burn up the night

2. Brothers Of Metal Pt.1
Strike while the iron is hot
Steel is strongest so say we all
And if we all were not brothers of metal would we fall? No
They tried to test our spirit
They tasted steel before we were done
Grinding their bones into the dust of the past
All blown away like a shot from a gun

We cast our lot together four still stand as one
Here we'll remain forever till our kindgdoms one

Brothers of metal
We are fighting with power and steel
Fighting for metal that's all that's real
Brothers of metal will always be there
Standing together with hands in the air

Let us drink to the power drink to the sound
Thunder and metal are shaking the ground
Drink to your brothers who are never to fall
We're all brothers of metal here in the hall

Our hearts are filled with metal and masters we have none
And we will die for metal, metal heals, my son

Brothers of metal
We are fighting with power and steel
Fighting for metal that's all that's real
Brothers of metal will always be there
Standing together with hands in the air

Let us drink to the power drink to the sound
Thunder and metal are shaking the ground
Drink to your brothers who are never to fall
We're all brothers of metal here in the hall

Brothers of metal
We are fighting with power and steel
Fighting for metal that's all that's real
Brothers of metal will always be there
Standing together with hands in the air

3. The Gods Made Heavy Metal
In the beginning there was silence and darkness
All across the earth
Then came the wind and a hole in the sky
Thunder and lightning came crashing down
Hit the earth and split the ground
Fire burned high in the sky

From down below fire melted the stone
The ground shook and started to pound

The gods made heavy metal and they saw that is was good
They said to play it louder than Hell
We promised that we would
When losers say it's over with you know that it's a lie
The gods made heavy metal and it's never gonna die

We are the true believers
It's our turn to show the world
In the fire of heavy metal we were burned
It's more than our religion it's the only way to live
But the enemies of metal we can't forgive

Cause we believe in the power and the might
And the gods who made metal are with us tonight

The gods made heavy metal and they saw that is was good
They said to play it louder than Hell
We promised that we would
When losers say it's over with you know that it's a lie
The gods made heavy metal and it's never gonna die

We believe in the power and the might
And the gods who made metal are with us tonight

We're here tonight for heavy metal are you ready in the hall
They have chosen us and we have heard the call
Gonna tear the roof off with our sound

Crack the walls and shake the ground
Fight tonight for metal one and all

Cause we believe in the power and the might
And the gods who made metal are with us tonight

The gods made heavy metal and they saw that is was good
They said to play it louder than Hell
We promised that we would
When losers say it's over with you know that it's a lie
The gods made heavy metal and it's never gonna die

4. Courage
Some want to think hope is lost see me stand alone
I can't do what others may want then I'll have no home

So for now wave good-bye and leave your hands held high
Hear this song of courage long into the night
So for now wave good-bye and leave your hands held high
Hear this song of courage long into the night

And the wind will bear my cry to all who hope to fly
Hear this song of courage ride into the night

Battles are fought by those with the courage to believe
They are won by those who find the heart
Find a heart to share
This heart that fills the soul will point the way to victory
If there's a fight then I'll be there, I'll be there

So for now wave good-bye, leave your hands held high
Hear this song of courage long into the night
And the wind will bear my cry to all who hope to fly
Lift your wings up high my friend fearless to the end
So for now wave good-bye, leave your hands held high
Hear this song of courage ride into the night

5. Number 1
We belong to the world we belong to the wind
We are the spirit of the competition's end
Turning hours into days burning muscles feel the pain
The heart and soul of discipline my friends

We are sending you a challenge it's very clear
We came to win that is why we are here
Demanding to be tested, tested by the best
Not to be forgotten like all the rest

The time has come all the training done
The muscle and the blood will come to pay

Let the game begin hear the starting gun
Play from the heart today we will overcome
When the game is over all the counting's done
We were born to win number 1

Today is the day all the training through
We have come for the number one not the number two
Let the contest begin play hard fight to win
Immortality victory and fame

The time has come all the training done
The muscle and the blood will come to pay

Let the game begin hear the starting gun
Play from the heart today we will overcome
When the game is over all the counting's done
We were born to win number 1

Today is the day all the training through
We have come for the number one not the number two
Let the contest begin play hard fight to win
Immortality victory and fame

Let the game begin hear the starting gun
Play from the heart today we will overcome
When the game is over all the counting's done
We were born to win number 1

6. Outlaw
I'm a stranger in town and my guns never cold
I'm a gambler so bet on your life
You'll never live to grow old
I deal in lead I won't step aside
Where trouble's waitin well so am I
I live for the fight the thrill of the kill
Paid in gold for the blood I spill

Outlaw outlaw outlaw ride
Into the West a gun by your side
Hell and glory honor and pride
A gun will decide where the outlaws ride

The law of the West was the law of the gun
Shoot and be fast live on the run
Stay alive be fast on the draw
Live by the gun or die by the law

Outlaw outlaw outlaw ride
Into the West a gun by your side
Hell and glory honor and pride
A gun will decide where the outlaws ride
Shot through the heart in the blink of an eye
Buried up on boot hill
Life is cheap when the bounty is high
So be ready to kill

The law of the West was the law of the gun
Shoot and be fast live on the run
Stay alive be fast on the draw
live by the gun or die by the law
Shot of whisky I'll be on my way
Back in the saddle pull on the reins
Spurs to the beast over the hill
Another town one more kill

Outlaw outlaw outlaw ride
Into the West a gun by your side
Hell and glory honor and pride
A gun will decide where the outlaws ride

7. King
Now is the time to reach for the sky
Gather the wind hear the voice to fly
To know why they sing about heroes and kings
Who were brave and not afraid to die
Look and you'll see that a new day will bring
The will to go on and fight through endless suffering
For all who believe wait a crown a ring
The power of the man who would be king
The power of the man who would be king

Into the fight of hopes and dreams
The master of the wind knows nothing's what is seems
The melting of the soul the wish of those who scheme
The taking of the will by destroyers of the dream
They live to spread the fear of the wrong of right of self
They want us all to live like books upon a shelf
But we know we have the power to fight and make a stand
Strike when we are challenged all across the land to be king

Fight for the crown, fight for the ring
We're fighting the world, we fight for the king

Time to face the world let brothers never fight
Forever forge ahead and keep the dream in sight
For those who never try they are sure to fail
The heart's a righteous wind that comes to fill the sail
For the glory of the king we fight to stay alive
By the power of the will, the spirit to survive to be king

Fight for the crown, fight for the ring
We're fighting the world, we fight for the king

All of the dreams held deep inside have a meaning to the soul
Freedom to bring a thought to the wing is waiting to unfold
For the crown and the ring
The power of the man who would be king

Fight for the crown, fight for the ring
We're fighting the world, we fight for the king

For the glory of the king we fight to stay alive - Fight
By the power of the will the spirit to survive - Fight
Across the gates of Heaven beyond the gates of Hell - Fight
We fought to stay together
We have won and have lived to tell who would be king

Fight for the crown, fight for the ring
We're fighting the world, we fight for the king

8. Today Is A Good Day To Die
[instrumental]

9. My Spirit Lives On
[instrumental]

10. The Power
I've got the power to fly into the wind
The power to be free to die and live again
This power's like fire, fire loves to burn
Make the world a grave of ashes in an urn
The power in the darkness to see without my sight
Walk among the living free of wrong and right
The power of the magic the power of the spell
Not to serve in Heaven but one day to rule in Hell

Power the power the power

This power's greater than love and of hate
This is the power of will and of fate
The power to kill the power to feel
The power of blood the triumph of steel
Greater that the power of a priest or a sinner
The power to defy to fight and be the winner
The power of the demons spirits I command
Always by my side to serve the master's plan

Power the power the power

None can fight the power none can fight the wind
Secrets of all life and death are carried there within
Call out to the power of the darkness and light
Have dominion of the earth be lord of all the night
Kill all those who stand against you look into their eyes
Drink their blood and laugh as they pay for all their lies
Piss upon their graves then cast a final spell
Fly into the night and one day meet in Hell

Power the power the power

MANOWAR LYRICS


1. Call To Arms
When they see us they will run for their lives
To the end they will pay for their lies
So long did we wait, now we are home

Here once again there's a battle to fight
Gather together for the sound and the might
So long did we wait, now we are home

Now we will fight for the kingdom, fighting with steel
Kill all of them, their blood is our seal
Fight till the last of the enemy is dead
Ride through their blood that we gladly have shed

I now issue the call, are you ready to fight - yeah
Fight altogether as one for the right
To be free once again - tonight we will win

I can see by the look that you have in your eyes
You came here for metal, to fight and to die
Defenders of steel, now we are home

Fight for the kingdom bound for glory
Armed with a heart of steel
I swear by the brothers who stand before me
To no man shall I kneel
Their blood is upon my steel

[Repeat 3, 4, 5, chorus to fade]

2. Fight For Freedom
There's a sound heard across the land
It's heard across the sea
You'll only hear it if you listen with your hearts
And one day hope to be free

To hear the sound of freedom many gave their lives
They fought for you and me
Those memories will always live inside us
And now it's our time to be free

[Chorus:]
Where the eagles fly - I will soon be there
If you want to - come along with me my friend
Say the words and you'll be free
From the mountains to the sea
We'll fight for freedom again

Scream out loud for all the world to hear
From sea to shining sea ??
Let freedom ring and every man be king
To live as one through the years

[Repeat chorus]

Now is the time we all must stand together
So raise your hands show them we are strong
Side by side the fight goes on forever
Marching to the battle with this song

[Repeat chorus to fade]

3. Nessun Dorna
Nessun dorma, nessun dorma
Tu pure, o principessa,
Nella tua fredda stanza
Guardi le stelle che tremano
D'amore e di speranza!
Ma il mio mistero e chiuso in me,
Il nome mio nessun sapra!
No, no, sulla tua bocca lo diro,
Quando la luce splendera!
Ed il mio bacio sciogliera
Il silenzio che ti fa mia!

Dilegua, o notte!
Tramontate, stelle, tramontate, stelle!
All'alba vincero, vincero, vincero!
Dilegua, o notte!
Tramontate, stelle, tramontate, stelle!
All'alba vincero, vincero, vincero!

4. Valhalla

5. Swords In The Wind
I surrender my soul
Odin hear my call
One day I'll sit beside your throne
In Valhalla's great hall
Like so many before me
I'll die with honor and pride

The right of the warrior
Forever to fight by your side
Send a sign, raise the sail
Wave a last goodbye
Destiny is calling
Immortality be mine

Call the witch to cast the runes
Weave a magic spell
We who die in battle are born
Not for heaven, not for hell

[Bridge:]
We are sons of Odin
The fire we burn inside
Is the legacy of warrior kings
Who reign above in the sky

[Chorus:]
I will lead the charge
My sword into the wind
Sons of Odin fight
To die and live again
Viking ships cross the sea
In cold wind and rain
Sail into the black of night
Magic stars our guiding light

Today the blood of battle
Upon my weapons will never dry
Many I'll send into the ground
Laughing as they die

[Repeat bridge, chorus]

Place my body on a ship
And burn it on the sea
Let my spirit rise
Valkiries carry me
Take me to Valhalla
Where my brothers wait for me
Fires burn into the sky
My spirit will never die

[Repeat chorus to fade]

6. An American Trilogy
Oh I wish I was in the land of cotton
Old times they are not forgotten
Look away, look away, look away Dixie land

Oh I wish I was in Dixie away, away
In Dixie land I'll take my stand
To live and die in Dixie

Dixie land where I was born
Early Lord one frosty morning
Look away, look away, look away Dixie land

Glory, glory, hallelujah
Glory, glory, hallelujah
Glory, glory, hallelujah
This truth is marching on

So hush little baby, don't you cry
You know your daddy's bound to die
All my trials Lord will soon be over

Glory, glory, hallelujah
This truth is marching on
This truth is marching on

7. The March

8. Warriors Of The World (United)
Here our soldiers stand from all around the world
Waiting in a line to hear the battle cry
All are gathered here, victory is near
The sound will fill the hall, bringing power to us all

We alone are fighting for metal that is true
We own the right to live the fight, we're here for all of you
Now swear the blood upon your steel will never dry
Stand and fight together beneath the battle sky

[Chorus:]
Brothers everywhere - raise your hands into the air
We're warriors, warriors of the world
Like thunder from the sky - sworn to fight and die
We're warriors, warriors of the world

Many stand against us, but they will never win
We said we would return and here we are again
To bring them all destruction, suffering and pain
We are the hammer of the gods, we are thunder, wind and rain.

There they wait in fear with swords in feeble hands
With dreams to be a king, first one should be a man
I call about and charge them all with a life that is a lie
And in their final hour they shall confess before they die

[Repeat chorus]

If I should fall in battle, my brothers who fight by my side
Gather my horse and weapons, tell my family how I died
Until then I will be strong, I will fight for all that is real
All who stand in my way will die by steel

Brothers everywhere - raise your hands into the air
We're warriors, warriors of the world

[Repeat chorus to fade]

9. Hand Of Doom
Hands of doom are reaching out to crush all infidels who stray
Time to know the pain, no time to run within
And these hands you see before you will end the light of day
Your ashes will be cast into the wind
Your blood's upon the soil, your body fed to wolves
Not one of you will be left alive
Hear the sound pounding and the army of the night
By the hammer of Thor you now shall die

[Chorus:]
Tonight we strike, there is thunder in the sky
Together we'll fight, some of us will die
But they'll always remember that we made a stand
And many will die by my hand

High atop the mountain, with hammers in the wind
Lusting for blood and death again
In a flash of lightning strike now the house of death invites you
Body and soul to come within
I see the fear you have inside, you can run but never hide
I will hunt you down and tear you limb from limb
Nothing shall remain, not your memory, your name
It will be as though you never, ever lived

[Repeat chorus, 2nd verse, chorus]

10. House Of Death
Blood and thunder mix with rain
Into the kingdom of darkness again
Lightning flash and body in flame
All shall kneel at the sound of my name
My path is set, I live with no regret
I'm sworn to kill, never to forget

[Chorus:]
No road back, I never will return
Into the fire of hell I will burn
And die, die, die into the house of death
And die, die, die into the fire of hell

Army of the heavens, my army waits in hell
To battle on the earth, for all the souls who fell
I will not go onto my death alone
Seven gates to pass until I reach my home
Across the bridge of death, beyond the gates of light
Into the heart of darkness, into the black of night

[Repeat chorus]

Into the darkness I command my soul
Never shall I repent, never shall I be saved
I go into the house of death
Before my last breath my enemies all shall die

Die, die, die into the house of death
Die, die, die into the fire of hell

11. Fight Until We Die
When they come, I'll be ready
I hear their voices inside
The stars in the heavens are moving
Soon they will align

Thor, god of thunder
Let me die with a sword in my hand
Raise your hands, swords in the wind
Brothers of metal together again
With blood in our voices we ride
We'll fight till we win or we'll fight until we die

Gods of thunder, fire and rain
Cut into the earth till none shall remain
Sons of demons I command you to fly
Ride on from hell into the sky
We'll fight until we die

[Repeat all]

MANOWAR LYRICS


1. Manowar
We met on English ground
in a backstage room
We heard the sound
And we all knew what we had to do

We called the high command
Requested leave to make a stand
And in the field we grew
And we all knew

Soon the time would come
For us to fight,
Destination
now in sight

Oooh, Manowar
Born to live forever more
The right to conquer every shore
Hold your ground and give no more

Our fight will never end
So we called on partisans
To raise your hands
And take our stand

Look sharp
when duty calls
Where we march
cities fall
And the strong survive
And take our side

2. Kings Of Metal
Manowar Manowar living on the road
When we're in town speakers explode
We don't attract wimps 'cause we're too loud
Just true metal people that's Manowar's crowd

They wanna keep us down
But they can't last
When we get up we're gonna kick your ass
Gonna keep on burnin'
We always will
Other bands play Manowar kill
Other bands play Manowar kill

We like it hard, we like it fast
We got the biggest amps, man they blast
True metal people wanna rock not pose
Wearin' jeans and leather, not cracker jack clothes

They wanna keep us down
But they can't last
When we get up we're gonna kick your ass
Gonna keep on burnin'
We always will
Other bands play Manowar kill
Other bands play Manowar kill

We're the kings of metal commin' to town
When we light up, have the roof nailed down
Don't try to tell us that we're too loud
'Cause there ain't no way that we'll ever turn down

They wanna keep us down
But they can't last
When we get up we're gonna kick your ass
Gonna keep on burnin'
We always will
Other bands play Manowar kill

3. Kill With Power
Hear what's written on the wind.
We come to kill and kill again.
Our arrows fall like hail
Trample on the dead. - Ride through the
Gate of clouds - stand on the open step.

Run beserk - spreading fear and pain.
Black shield and weapons, black our chain.
None can harm us - not their fire -
Iron or steel - for we have the
Will to power - with power we will
Kill.

Kill with power - die die
Kill with power - die die

To the war god Odin you will pray.
And the curse of weapons shall
Remain. On the blood of all our
Fathers - on their weapons we now
Swear to avenge - not lament.
Give the False ones death.

Kill with power - die die
Kill with power - die die

4. Sign Of The Hammer
The spell has been broken,
the curse has been lifted
Black is the wind on the heels
Of the Gifted
Four sworn to vengeance,
See the hate in our eyes
Called by the Gods, and given a sign

Onward pounding Into Glory Ride
Sign of the Hammer be my guide
Final warning all stand aside
Sign of the Hammer it's my time

Pounding, pounding, we are back from the dead
those who denied us are delivered instead
Into the hands of Four sworn to ride
Now the people will triumph and live by the sign

5. My Spirit Lives On

6. Piano Interlude

7. Courage
Some Want To Think Hope Is Lost See Me Stand Alone
I Can't Do What Others May Want Then I'll Have No Home

So For Now Wave Good-bye And Leave Your Hands Held High
Hear This Song Of Courage Long Into The Night
So For Now Wave Good-bye Leave Your Hands Held High
Hear This Song Of Courage Long Into The Night

And The Wind Will Bear My Cry To All Who Hope To Fly
Hear This Song Of Courage Ride Into The Night

Battles Are Fought By Those With The Courage To Believe
They Are Won By Those Who Find The Heart
Find A Heart To Share
This Heart That Fills The Soul Will Point The Way To Victory
If There's A Fight Then I'll Be There I'll Be There

So For Now Wave Good-bye, Leave Your Hands Held High
Hear This Song Of Courage Long Into The Night
And The Wind Will Bear My Cry To All Who Hope To Fly
Lift Your Wings Up High My Friend Fearless To The End
So For Now Wave Good-bye, Leave Your Hands Held High
Hear This Song Of Courage Long Into The Night

8. Spirit Horse Of The Cherokee
The trail of tears began for all the Cherokee
The white men came to trade & borrow but then they would not leave
Some of us were taken by boat, and died at sea
Those of us who lived were sold to slavery

We welcomed them as brothers knowing nothing of their greed
Born hunters not the hunted as the white man hunts for me
We are descendants of the animals we live among the free
Our trail of tears would end one day at Wounded Knee.

Great Spirit, thunder birds fly, we are wild and free
To fight and die by the open sky, Spirit Horse ride for me

When we do the Ghost Dance, the buffalo will return
Paint ourselves for war, now blood and fire burn
Great Spirit makes us strong, take us to the sky
The Cherokee are brave, we are not afraid to die

Great Spirit, thunder birds fly, we are wild and free
To fight and die by the open sky, Spirit Horse ride for me

Red Cloud, Black Hawk, Sitting Bull, Crazy Horse, Geronimo
Strong and brave warriors to the grave

There has been much killing there will be much more
The Medicine Man is dancing he's calling us to war,
Hatchets sing with pride let the white men die

Great Spirit, thunder birds fly, we are wild and free
To fight and die by the open sky, Spirit Horse ride for me

9. Blood Of My Enemies
Three sons have I, and they
Ride by my side. - The fierce,
The black, and the wicked are
their names - we ride down my
enemies on their half-hearted flight.
No voice of mercy - no evangels of light.

Mighty messengers - heathens rage
Witness our coming - gods of the dead.
I ride through the air -
I laugh as I die - with powers of evil
Dark knowledge is mine.
The ride of the wicked.
The 1st sin was trust. -
Kill without warning - for blood now
I lust.

Strong winds - magic mist
To Asgard the Valkries fly
High overhead - they carry the dead
Where the blood of my enemy lies.

Three sons have I, and they
Ride by my side. - The fierce,
The black, and the wicked are
their names - we ride down my
enemies on their half-hearted flight.
No voice of mercy - no evangels of light.

Strong winds - magic mist
To Asgard the Valkries fly
High overhead - they carry the dead
Where the blood of my enemy lies.

10. Hail And Kill
Brothers I am calling from the valley of the kings
with nothing to atone
A dark march lies ahead, together we will ride like
thunder from the sky
May your sword stay wet like a young girl in her
prime
Hold your hammers high

Blood and death are waiting like a raven in the sky
I was born to die
Hear me while I live
As I look into your eyes
None shall hear a lie
Power and dominion are taken by the will
By divine right hail and kill

Hail, Hail, Hail and Kill, Hail and Kill
Hail, Hail, Hail and Kill, Hail and Kill

My father was a wolf
I'm a kinsman of the slain
Sworn to rise again
I will bring salvation, punishment and pain
The hammer of hate is our faith
Power and dominion are taken by the will
By divine right hail and kill

Hail, Hail, Hail and Kill, Hail and Kill
Hail, Hail, Hail and Kill, Hail and Kill

Rip their flesh
Burn their hearts
Stab them in the eyes
Rape their women as they cry
Kill their servants
Burn their homes
Till there's no blood left to spill
Hail and Kill
Power and dominion are taken by the will
By divine right hail and kill

Hail, Hail, Hail and Kill, Hail and Kill

12. Wheels Of Fire
Since the dawn of time
I've rolled across the earth
Spinning in the dust
Long before your birth
Eating tar and gasoline
Every light I see is green
Open pipes, my machine's triple-plated chrome

Spirit of the wheel

Wheels of fire burn the night
Ride across the sky
Wheels of fire burning bright
We live to ride

Motors running
Now you're gonna learn
Waiting on the line
Make your tires burn
Fast, faster, faster, faster
Speeding always kills
Nothing else takes us to get these thrills

Spirit of the wheel

Wheels of fire burn the night
Ride across the sky
Wheels of fire burning bright
We live to ride

Blood and thunder on the road
My heart is pounding
My blood is nitroglycerine
I'm fire
Burning, burning, burning, burning
Ready to explode
Don't want nothing left of me to scrape off the road

Spirit of the wheel

Wheels of fire burn the night
Ride across the sky
Wheels of fire burning bright
We live to ride

Clouds of smoke
Tires screaming
Fire in my hair
Blown into a thousand pieces
Scattered everywhere
Fast, burn, burning, faster
Wanna take a ride
Spirit of the wheel
Wheels of fire ride

Spirit of the wheel

Wheels of fire burn the night
Ride across the sky
Wheels of fire burning bright
We live to ride

17. Thor (The Powerhead)
Black clouds on the horizon
Great thunder and burning rain
His chariot pounding,
I heard the heavens scream his name

I watched as he shouted
To the giants that died that day
He hehd up his hammer high
And called to Odin for a sign

Thor the mighty, Thor the brave
Crush the infidels in your way
By your hammer let none be saved
Live to die on that final day
Gods, Monsters and Men
We'll die together in the end

God of thunder, god of rain
Earth shaker who feels no pain
The powerhead of the Universe
Now send your never ending curse

Swing your hammer to crack the sky
Lift your cape so that you might fly
Back to Odin and the Gods on High
And leave this mortal world

18. King
Now Is The Time To Reach For The Sky
Gather The Wind Hear The Voice To Fly

The Will To Go On And Fight Trough Endless Suffering
For All Who Believe Wait A Crown A Ring

The Power Of The Man Who Would Be King
The Power Of The Man Who Would Be King

Into The Fight Of Hopes And Dreams
The Master Of The Wind Knows Nothing's What It Seems
The Melting Of The Soul The Wish Of Those Who Scheme
The Taking Of The Will By Destroyers Of The Dream
They Live To Spread The Fear Of The Wrong Of Right Of Self
They Want Us All To Live Like Books Upon A Shelf
But We Know We Have The Power To Fight And Make A Stand
Strike When We Are Challenged All Across The Land To Be King

Fight For The Crown, Fight For The Ring

19. The Gods Made Heavy-Metal
In The Beginning There Was Silence And Darkness
All Across The Earth
Then Came The Wind And A Hole In The Sky
Thunder And Lightning Came Crashing Down
Hit The Earth And Split The Ground
Fire Burned High In The Sky

From Down Below Fire Melted The Stone
The Ground Shook And Started To Pound

The Gods Made Heavy Metal And They Saw That It Was Good
They Said To Play It Louder Than Hell

When Losers Say It's Over With You Know That It's A Lie
The Gods Made Heavy Metal And It's Never Gonna Die

20. Black Wind, Fire And Steel
Full moon light is calling me
My kigndom lies within
The mystic soul and lions heart
Brought by the talisman
The ecstasy of battle takes me
Where the falcons fly
Immortal youth was granted me
I will never die

Born of Black wind fire and steel
Born of Black wind fire and steel
Born to teach them all to heel
Born of Black wind fire and steel

Pounded by the hammers
Of the giants of the world
I can see in darkness
I'm the overlord
Single combat I await
My shadow brings them fear
The spikes upon my chariot
Will grind them when they're near

Born of Black wind fire and steel
Born of Black wind fire and steel
Born to teach them all to heel
Born of Black wind fire and steel

I am an outcast on the path of no return
Punisher and swordsman
I was born to burn
Black Wind always follows
Where my black horse rides
Fire's in my soul
Steel is on my side

Born of Black wind fire and steel
Born of Black wind fire and steel
Born to teach them all to heel
Born of Black wind fire and steel

21. Return Of The Warlord
Now The Time Has Come When All Is Said And Done
We're Back Together On The Road It's Time To Fly
No More Time To Wait You Know It Feels So Great
Wearin Leather On A Horse Of Steel I Ride
I Ain't Waitin To Get Old I'm Runnin Hot I'm Never Cold
Kiss My Ass If You Don't Like Me I Don't Care
I Got My Wheels Got My Friends We're On The Road Again
We're All Crazy Gonna Ride Until We Die

Time To Burn You Losers Better Learn
No One Controls Our Goddamn Life
We'll Do Just What We Feel Riding Horses Made Of Steel
We're Here To Burn Up The Night

Losers Try To Put Us Down It's Just Another Day
I Got No Money Or Big House Just Got Life
I Don't Like To Save It's More Fun To Spend
If You Like Metal You're My Friend
And That Bike Out In The Yard Well That's My Wife
Don't Try To Understand Me My Family Never Will
Had To Punch My Teacher Out Now He's Chilled
I Might Stay In School Or Die In Prision
Either Way It's My Decision One More Beer And Heavy Metal
And I'm Just Fine

Time To Burn You Losers Better Learn
No One Controls Our Goddamn Life
We'll Do Just What We Feel Riding Horses Made Of Steel
We're Here To Burn Up The Night

We Are The Undefeated We're Not Living In The Past
We're Here Tonight To Kick Some Goddamn Ass
Feel The Power Of The Wheel Lets Drink To Riding Steel
Livin Hard And Ridin Fast

Time To Burn You Losers Better Learn
No One Controls Our Goddamn Life
We'll Do Just What We Feel Riding Horses Made Of Steel
We're Here To Burn Up The Night

22. Carry On
The north star always guides me
When winter skies are gray
And I wait for sun when all are one
I shall not betray
Calling at me
I'm waiting when all are led astray

Carry on my sons forever
Carry On when I am gone
Carry On for when the day is long
Forever Carry On
For as long as we're together
Then forever Carry On

Darkness all around us
We don't close our eyes
No one's gonna ground us
We were born to fly
Comin' at us no stopping
Born to amplify

Carry on my sons forever
Carry On when I am gone
Carry On when the day is long
Forever Carry On
For as long as we're together
Then forever Carry On

Yeah, be my brother
Fight to stay alive
All the world can't change us
With all their burned-out jive
Come get us now we're waiting
We won't run and hide

Carry on my sons forever
Carry On when I am gone
Carry On when the day is long
Forever Carry On
For as long as we're together
Then forever Carry On

Now we're all together
Let's sing a fighting song
One hundred thousand riders
We can't all be wrong
Comin' at us no stopping
Always Carry On

Carry on my sons forever
Carry On when I am gone
Carry On when the day is long
Forever Carry On
For as long as we're together
Forever Carry On

23. Battle Hymn
By moonlight we ride ten thousands side by side
With swords drawn held high our whips and armour shine
Hail to thee our infantry still brave beyond the grave
All sworn the eternal vow the time to strike is now

Gone are the days when freedom shone now blood and steel meet bone
In the light of the battle's way the sands of time will shake
How proud our soldiers stand with mace and chain in hand
Sound of charge into glory ride over the top of their vanguished pride

To the battle we ride we crossed a starlit sky
No space no time we'll catch the wind
Strange losses, men died we crossed a starlit sky
And still no space and time we'll catch the wind

1. The Ascension
[Christopher Lee]
Powers of the universe did sire a son...
He was baptized by fire, water, earth, and sky...
From darkness, he rose up in triumph
To ascend the throne of light,
And he alone shall ever be known
As the King of Kings...

[Eric Adams]
I enter this world born under a sign of infinite light,
And there I shall dwell. I now understand...
All that I am shall live in my command...

2. King Of Kings
Voices of Victory
All Shout and proclaim
The Kingdom of Glory is mine
The Raise of the will are a prophecy filled

I'm the lord of the day and the night
I have nothing to sell but the power of hell
My Armies of fire awaits
I'm here to be paid for the pact that was made
My payments can never be late

Crack the Earth, Gods of Thunder
Men and beast will be torn asunder
Into the Fight I own the right
To be the King of kings

My Enemies rise and look to the skies
They Pray I will never appear
The Light has no meaning
Awake me I'm dreaming
They live in a castle of fear

I summon the demons that live in the wind
As my Chariot strives in the Storm
With the hot blood of Battle
I wait in my saddle
I live and I'll die by the sword

Crack the Earth, Gods of Thunder
Men and beast will be torn asunder
Into the Fight I own the right
To be the King of kings

All the days of his live
He walked without fear
All who's lives he touched
Were made better for knowing him
As he returned goodness with good
So true is justice and retribution In failing

As my sword is my soul
Then let all who stand before me know
I bring a storm and Magic wind
The Kingdom of the Kings

MANOWAR LYRICS


1. The Dawn Of Battle
Dreadful Thunder
The storms moving in
And Judgment day is calling
My soul has been healed
By the power of steel
And the sound of glory 

I will send into the ground
All that are found
By the sign of the hammer falling
Yes Heathens will fall
I will strike down them all
Then you will know my calling

Bravery calls my name
In the sound of the wind in the night
My sword will drink blood
And I will fight
Yes I will fight
In the dawn of battle
Dawn of Battle

I will rise up from the chaos
I will rise up from the grave
A brother to the darkness
A master to the slaves

I am the soul descendent
Of the fire and the rage
I was wrought upon the earth
Born to rule and battle wage

By the total domination
Of the world in my command
By the Air and the water
By the Fire and the land

I give no explanation
I was branded by the will
Bringer of Death and Destruction
To all that I now kill

Bravery calls my name
In the sound of the wind in the night
My sword will drink blood
And I will fight
Yes I will fight
In the dawn of battle
Dawn of Battle

I long to be free
So I wait for a sign
I wait for a star
To fall from the sky
From the dust of sleep
A promise to keep
Then all who see shall believe
Deliver into my hand
The sword of the land
Let my journey begin
So all shall understand
That if I fall
I will live again

I will rise up from the chaos
I will rise up from the grave
A brother to the darkness
A master to the slaves

I give no explanation
I was branded by the will
To bring of Death and Destruction
To all that I now kill

Bravery calls my name
In the sound of the wind in the night
My sword will drink blood
And I will fight
Yes I will fight
In the dawn of battle

2. I Believe
From the darkness I walk into the light
From the day I walk into the night
From the shadows I will appear
With a message for all who will hear

For the weak of heart I will be strong
To the defenders of faith I will belong
Till the last of us fight till we die
Till the keys of the kingdome are mine

All stand together for the world to see
Now the time is right to live out all our dreams
Say the words forever, your strength will never leave
If you want to win the fight, say "I believe"

[Verse 1,2,3]

Let's all stand together for the world to see
Now the time is right to live out all our dreams
Say the words forever, your strength will never leave
If you want to win the fight, say "I believe"
If you want to win tonight, say "I believe"

3. Call To Arms
When they see us they will run for their lives
To the end they will pay for their lies
So long did we wait, now we are home

Here once again there's a battle to fight
Gather together for the sound and the might
So long did we wait now we are home

Now we will fight for the Kingdom fighting with steel
Kill all of them, their blood is our seal
Fight till the last of the enemy is dead
Ride through their blood that we gladly have shed

I now issue the call, are you ready to fight - yeah
Fight all together as one for the right to be free once again
Tonight we will win

I can see by the look that you have in your eyes
You came here for metal, to fight and to die
Defenders of Steel now we are home

Fight for the kingdom bound for glory
Armed with a heart of steel
I swear by the Brothers who stand before me
To no man shall I kneel
Their blood is upon my steel
Blood is upon my steel

Fight for the Kingdom fighting with steel
Kill all of them, their blood is our seal
Fight till the last of the enemy is dead
Ride through their blood that we gladly have shed

I now issue the call, are you ready to fight - yeah
Fight all together as one for the right to be free once again
Tonight we will win

I can see by the look that you have in your eyes
You came here for metal, to fight and to die
Defenders of Steel now we are home

Fight for the kingdom bound for glory
Armed with a heart of steel
I swear by the Brothers who stand before me
To no man shall I kneel
Their blood is upon my steel

Souls full of thunder
Hearts of steel
Killers of men
Of warriors friend
Sworn to avenge our fallen brothers
To the end...

One day too
I may fall
I will enter Odin's Hall
I will die sword in hand
My name and my deeds will
Scorch the land

Glory and fame!
Blood is our name..
Soul full of thunder!!
Hearts of steel
Killers of men!
Of warriors friend
Sworn to avenge our fallen brothers

Sons of the gods

Open Valhalla's door

Hail Gods of War

Sons of Odin we four..!!
By the hammer of Thor!
Ride down from the sky....
Another is born
Another shall fall
This day men will die!!!!

Glory and fame
Blood is our name
Souls full of thunder
Hearts of steel
Killers of men
Of warriors friend
Sworn to avenge our fallen brothers
Sons of the gods today we shall die
Open Valhalla's door

Hail Gods of War

Sons of the gods today we shall die
Open Valhalla's door
Let the battle begin with swords in the wind
Hail Gods of War

Let the battle begin with swords in the wind
Hail
Gods
of War!!!

[Narration:]
...Onward into the heart of battle
Fought the sons of Odin
Outnumbered many times
Still
they fought on
Blood poured fourth from their wounds
Deep into the earth
Vultures waited for the broken shells
That once were bodies
But Odin alone would choose the day
They would enter Valhalla
And in their hour of need
He sent forth unto them The Berserker Rage
Now gods and men
They rose up from the ground
Screaming like wild animals
Such is the gift of absolute power
No blade or weapon would harm them
They killed them and horses alike
And all who stood before them died that day

Hail Gods Of War!!!!!

As my sword is my soul
Then let all who stand before me know
I bring a storm and Magic wind
The Kingdom of the Kings..

I summon the demons that live in the wind
As my Chariot drives in the Storm
With the hot blood of Battle
I wait in my saddle
I live and I'll die by the sword

[Chorus x3]

King of kings!!!
King of kings!!!

King of...

Of Kings!

4. Army Of The Dead, Part I
Raise thy weapons on this day
Ye shall not die alone

Fight and die let Valkyries fly
For they shall take thee home

I promise thee that on this night
Ye shall be by my side

Asgard's halls await with heroes
Brothers that have died

For thee we wait at Asgard's gates
Come join us by our side

Valhalla waits so choose thy fate
For all of us must die!

5. Sleipnir
He is descended from giants. His father Loki,
God of fire, is the sworn blood brother to
Odin himself. He rides across land, sea and air
From the land of the living, to the land of
The dead. This eight legged steed crosses eight
Points of the compass, from eight directions
Into eight dimensions. He is bringer of the
Valiant dead from the battlefield to Valhalla!

Carry we who die in battle
Over land and sea
Across the rainbow bridge to Valhalla
Odin's waiting for me

He was born of giants
His icy coat is grey
At night he rides into the world of death
The living by day

One day on his back I shall ride
From the battlefield into the sky
Borne by Valkyries we valiant dead
Into the hall of heroes shall be led

Ride down from Asgard
To the battlefield
Bringer of the valiant dead
Who died but never yielded

Carry we who die in battle
Over land and sea
Across the rainbow bridge to Valhalla
Odin's waiting for me

Faster then the fastest horse alive
The living son of fire rides
From the halls of across the sky
To the world of gods and men

Eight legs and magic runes
Carved upon his teeth
Thunder and lightning
Sound beneath his feet
On his back the war god Odin rides
Sword and magic spear held high

Ride down from Asgard
To the battlefield
Bringer of the valiant dead
Who died but never yielded

Carry we who die in battle
Over land and sea
Across the rainbow bridge to Valhalla
Odin's waiting for me

6. Loki God Of Fire
The son of giants
Walks across the sky
To the gods a friend
Fathered beast and men

As a falcon he did fly
Far across the sky
To take back the hammer
Of Thor his friend

He lives between the worlds
The world of gods and men

He is the god of fire
Burning higher
God of fire
Into the sky

The father of a wolf
And the serpent of the sea
The ruler of hell
A giant is he

To Odin he's a brother
A brother who is sly
One who changes shape
Who walks across the sky

He lives between the worlds
The world of gods and men

He is the god of fire
Burning higher
God of fire
Into the sky

God of fire
Burning higher
God of fire
Into the sky

Brother to Thor
And Odin god of war
Loki god of fire
Reigns for evermore

The father of a wolf
And the serpent of the sea
The ruler of hell
A giant is he

To Odin he's a brother
A brother who is sly
One who changes shape
Who walks across the sky
God of fire

Burning higher
God of fire
Into the sky

7. Blood Brothers
When the world turns you away
A friend will not say no
There is strength that we all have
It's not the strength we show

And in your darkest hour
In your darkest nights
Whatever life will do
I am here for you

Think of me wherever you are
When it seems like you're reaching the end
Call on me, know in your heart
On one you can always depend
I am thy friend

Though we're far away
The stars above are the same
And when you feel alone
There's one who shares your pain

A true friend has no price
There is none to pay
I remember you stood by me
I'm with you all the way

Think of me wherever you are
When it seems like you're reaching the end
Call on me, know in your heart
One who will always defend
I am thy friend

Think of me wherever you are
When it seems like you're reaching the end
Call on me, know in your heart
On one you can always depend
I am thy friend

Think of me wherever you are
When it seems like you're reaching the end
Call on me, know in your heart
One who will always defend
I am thy friend

8. Overture To Odin
[Instrumental]

9. The Blood Of Odin
Upon his shoulders perch two ravens, Hugin and Munin.
They circle the earth by day seeing all, at night they report to him the world's tidings.
He wears a golden helmet and a golden ring, at his side sit two wolves.
His weapons a magic sword and a spear called Gungnir, they are carved with runes.
His eight legged horse Sleipnir carries him over land, sea and air, the bringer of the valiant dead, the einherjar, from the battlefield across the rainbow bridge to Valhalla.

For a single drink of the enchanted water he paid with one eye, he was granted supreme wisdom.
He is the god of poetry, sorcery, and death.
Wounded, pierced by a spear he hung upside down for nine days.
Fasting and agony he made of himself a sacrifice to himself.
Given no bread nor mead he looked down, and with a loud cry fell screaming from the world tree.
In a flash of insight the secret magic of the runes was revealed to him.
He took up the runes and mastered them, eighteen powerful charms for protection, success in battle, lovemaking, healing and the power to bring back the dead.

His sacred blood mixed with black wind and rain wept down from the world tree deep into the earth.
He commanded the earth to crack open and to spew forth the strongest of the strong!

On this day he did bestow unto the world the sons of Odin!

10. The Sons Of Odin
Here to the blaze
I wander
Through this black night
I pounder
The edge of our mighty swords
Did clash
Fallen by our axes
Helmets smash

Glory and fame
Blood is our name
Souls full of thunder
Hearts of steel
Killers of men
Of warriors friend
Sworn to avenge our fallen brothers
To the end

One day too
I may fall
I will enter Odin's Hall
I will die sword in hand
My name and my deeds will
Scorch the land

Glory and fame
Blood is our name
Soul full of thunder
Hearts of steel
Killers of men
Of warriors friend
Sworn to avenge our fallen brothers

Sons of the gods today we shall die
Open Valhalla's door
Let the battle begin with swords in the wind
Hail Gods of War

[Solo]

Sons of Odin we for
By the hammer of Thor
Ride down from the sky
Another is born
Another shall fall
This day bent will die

(oh) Glory and fame
(oh) Blood is our name
(oh) Souls full of thunder
(oh) Hearts of steel
(oh) Killers of men
(oh) Of warriors friend
(oh) Sworn to avenge our fallen brothers

(oh) Sons of the gods today we shall die
(oh) Open Valhalla's door
(oh) Let the battle begin with swords in the wind
(oh) Hail Gods of War

(oh) Sons of the gods today we shall die
(oh) Open Valhalla's door
(oh) Let the battle begin with swords in the wind
(oh) Hail Gods of War

(oh) Let the battle begin with swords in the wind
(oh) Hail
(oh) Gods
(oh) of War!!!

[Onward into the heart of battle
Fought the sons of Odin
Outnumbered many times
Still - they fought on
Blood poured forth from their wounds
Deep into the earth
Vultures waited for the broken shells
That once were bodies
Thus Odin alone would choose the day
They would enter Valhalla
And in their hour of need
He sent forth onto them The Berserker Rage
Now gods embed
They rose up from the ground
Screaming like wild animals
Such is the gift of absolute power
No blade or weapon would hurt them
They killed them and horses alike
And all who stood before them died that day
Hail Gods Of War]

11. Glory Majesty Unity
Deep into the heart of the battle they fought. Covered on
All sides as all converged on them, until the four could
No longer be seen. As time passed I feared them lost, then
Slowly the armies separated, many were dead. I saw the four
Each down on one knee, all stopped to watch and gaze
Upon them with a smile of victory before sending them into
The ground.

Then they rose together to make a final stand. With their
Last bit of strength they raised their arms into the air pointing
Blood stained weapons to the sky. They called upon the god
Of war and made ready to die. But Odin would not call
Them this day to Valhalla, instead he sent thunder and
Lightning to strike the ground, bestowing upon them the
One gift every warrior lives in hope of - the berserker rage!

Now filled with that strength, the power of a thousand
Men was given them. No longer mortal they were touched
By the gods. This time when they took up the attack, men fell
Not by tens, but by hundreds, by thousands. And when the
Smoke did clear, the four spoke the words and the masses
Answered the response of the warrior's prayer.

Gods of war I call you
My sword is by my side
I seek a life of honor
Free from all false pride

I will crack the whip
With a bold mighty hail
Cover me with death
If I should ever fail

Glory, majesty, unity
Hail! Hail! Hail!

12. Gods Of War
Down from the sky
Into the fight
Hearts full of rage
Full of thunder and glory
Swords in the wind
Crossing the sky
Lords of doom
Bring an end to their story

Father on bended knee
I ask thee
Raise thy hand
We the sons of Odin
Await thy command
Born under the sign
Of the hammer we stand
And here we all may die
Our blood on the ground
The battle horns sound
Let thy Valkyries fly

Down from the sky
Into the fight
Hearts full of rage
Full of thunder and glory
Swords in the wind
Crossing the sky
Lords of doom
Bring an end to their story

Today is the day
We die in the fight
None shall remain
To pass one more night
Now Valhalla's calling us
Immortal
We are gods of war
Immortal
We are gods of war

Odin here the fallen wait
To join thee by thy side
Let Valhalla's gates open wide
Born under the sign
Of the hammer they lived
And here they fought and died
Their blood on the ground
The battle horns sound
Let thy Valkyries fly

Down from the sky
Into the fight
Hearts full of rage
Full of thunder and glory
Swords in the wind
Crossing the sky
Lords of doom
Bring an end to their story

Today is the day
We die in the fight
None shall remain
To pass one more night
Now Valhalla's calling us
Immortal
We are gods of war
Immortal
We are gods of war

Down from the sky
Into the fight
Hearts full of rage
Full of thunder and glory
Swords in the wind
Crossing the sky
Lords of doom
Bring an end to their story

13. Army Of The Dead, Part II
Raise thy weapons on this day
Ye shall not die alone

Fight and die let Valkyries fly
For they shall take thee home

I promise thee that on this night
Ye shall be by my side

Asgard's halls await with heroes
Brothers that have died

For thee we wait at Asgard's gates
Come join us by our side

Valhalla waits so choose thy fate
For all of us must die!

14. Odin
In the hall of the slain
Valkyries and heroes attend me
Ravens and wolves at my side
Forever they did befriend me

I paid an eye for a drink of mead
And was given wisdom supreme
Granted to me the secrets
Of magic, of life and death

Ah.. Speared hung upside down
Nine days and nights no food nor mead
The will to be a sacrifice
Of myself unto myself

Wisdom and rhyme
Sorcery, death living inside me
Of life and death I am king
For both do I bring by sword and spear and ring

Raise thy weapons on this day
Ye shall not die alone

Fight and die let Valkyries fly
For they shall take thee home

I promise thee that on this night
Ye shall be by my side

Asgard's halls await with hero's
Brothers that have died

For thee we wait at Asgard's gates
Come join us by our side

Valhalla waits so choose thy fate
For all of us must die!

15. Hymn Of The Immortal Warriors
A hero was he
Touching all our lives
As if he lived and died
In a single moment

Great were his deeds
All his words were true
He lived and died
A man of honor

He paid with his life
For his life was the price
To pass the gates immortal

Thy journey begins
With sword in the wind
Stay thy hand rest thy command
For Odin's call was heard above them all
Thy name shall never die!

Long shall we remember
He who walked the road of danger
Master of revenge
Death's no stranger

Blood and death lived on his sword
The god of war his only lord
Into the depths of hell
Go all he fell

Take thy shield take thy sword
All thy weapons to the sky
Ye shall need them when Odin bid thee rise

For none but the brave
Shall rise up from the grave
To see the Valkyries fly

And so it was by the hand of Odin
Did the immortal warrior pass through
The gates of Valhalla and into legend.

Rise brother rise pass Valhalla's gates
Here great warriors await

Reborn from thy steel
All thy wounds be healed

From the earth to the sky
Now the son of Odin rise!

Take thy place among the kings
For thy soul shall never die!

16. Die For Metal
They can't stop us
Let 'em try
For heavy metal
We will die!

Quit my job this morning said forever
I would hold my head up high
Cause I need metal in my life
Just like an eagle needs to fly

So I walked outside into the street
From a hall I heard thunder and screams
I walked inside so I could hear
And the guy beside me gave me a beer

He had his fist up in the air
And called me brother said my friends
Are over there

They call themselves immortals
They're the truest of the true
And in that very moment
I was born again like you

They said hold your head up high
Raise your fist up in the air
Play metal louder than hell
Louder than hell

They can't stop us
Let 'em try
For heavy metal
We would die!

Brothers stand beside me, there's a battle on
Know my words are true
There's a battle for true metal
They're marching; they're marching on
Me and you

Ten thousand strong are here tonight
With twenty thousand fists up in the air
The power of true metal's calling you
It's everywhere

Hold your head up high
Raise your fist up in the air
Play metal louder than hell
Louder than hell

They can't stop us
Let 'em try
For heavy metal
We would die!

MANOWAR LYRICS


1. The Lord Of Steel
In the nights
We take flights
Witness the sites
The power and glory of steel
I fought and died
Lived many lives before
I am immortal like my sword
I kneel to no one except the lord
And my lord is steel
If you see me you just passed your time
To the hills you can run but not hide
Blood and death are wherever i ride
Armed for battle the lord on my side
Stand and face the lord of steel
The lord of steel
In the eyes of the lord you have sinned
Let your punishment begin
Only by death you atone
You shall not die alone
For the glory of battle
I will fight until i die
Live one day as an eagle
Or a lifetime as a fly
Like a candle burning
The wheels of time are turning
The lord of steel commands you
To die by my hand
Stand and fight the lord of steel
Time to face the lord of steel

2. Manowarriors
Hear a rollin thunder
When we come across the land
Feel the ground a shaking
Start to understand
Sons of thunder
More than just a band
Kings of metal
Loudest in the land
Never gonna change our style
Gonna play tonight for quite a while
In heavy metal we believe
If you don’t like it time to leave
Manowarriors raise your hands
We fight for metal
Manowarriors raise your hands
Our fight is real
We do just what we feel
Sons of steel
We come from different countries
With metal and with might
We drink a lot of beers
And play our metal loud at night
Fly the flag of metal
Brothers all the same
Born to live for metal
It ain’t no game
Never gonna change our style
Gonna play tonight for quite a while
In heavy metal we believe
If you don’t like it time to leave
Manowarriors raise your hands
We fight for metal
Manowarriors raise your hands
Our fight is real
We do just what we feel
Sons of steel
Sons of thunder
More than just a band
Kings of metal
Loudest in the land
Never gonna change our style
Gonna play tonight for quite a while
In heavy metal we believe
If you don’t like it time to leave
Manowarriors raise your hands
We fight for metal
Manowarriors raise your hands
Our fight is real

3. Born In A Grave
A gift of life born in a grave
Never to die
A soul that will never be saved
That will never see light
While the world is sleeping
We all fly
In the daylight silence keeping
We wait for the night
When the day ends life begins
When the shadows take light
For hundreds of years
We are your fears
We never will die
When the light goes away
We come out to play
Innocence lost and a demon within
Forgive me father, yes i have sinned
I will never be holy
I will never be saved
This was the gift on the day
I was born in a grave
Basking in the moonlight
Wolves will howl
And the bats will fly
You never knew
We were watching
Lifeless inside
For the blood is the life
The gift of the night
That has kept us alive
For thousands of years
We lived in your tears
And we never will die
When the light goes away
We come out to play
Innocence lost and a demon within
Forgive me father yes i have sinned
I will never be holy
I will never be saved
This was my gift on the day
I was born in a grave

4. Righteous Glory
She is watching
From on high
She knows who lives or dies
She will take me to the sky
Should darkness be my fate
Then let me fall among brave
In battle i shall die
In righteous glory i abide
In righteous glory she’ll come to me tonight
She will carry me across the other side
My brothers wait
Odin knows my name
In the hall of the slain
She takes me through the clouds
To another place and time
Holds me in her arms
Immortal and divine
On hooves of thunder
Her white horse parts the sky
Take me to valhalla
Valkyrie mine

5. Touch The Sky
Thunder touched my soul
I heard a call all should know
It’s my time i’m alive
Some will come some will go
But most will never know
That greatness lives inside
Like the night turns into day
Doesn’t matter what they say
My will is strong as a mountain’s high
I feel so tall i can touch the sky
Speak your mind, put me down
Say your prayers when i’m around
I live the life i’m not passing by
Shorn of hopes and dreams
I don’t buy their foolish schemes
I just walk on by
I was born with a hero’s soul
If you got one then you know
Reach my hand where the eagles fly
I feel so tall i can touch the sky

6. Black List
See the writings on the wall
If you can read
There’s a black list
Got one name and it’s me
Yea i got no invitation
But i won’t leave
Gonna keep on fighting
For everything that’s me
It’s my life
I’m living free
Ain’t nobody nowhere
Got no chains on me
See the writings on the wall
If you can read
There’s a black list
Got one name and it’s me
Yea i got no invitation
But i won’t leave
Gonna keep on fighting
For everything that’s me
If you don’t like me - tough, you better leave
Keep on fighting for the things i believe
See the writings on the wall
If you can read
There’s a black list
Got one name and it’s me
Yea i got no invitation
But i won’t leave
Gonna keep on fighting
For everything that’s me
Gonna fight for all the things
That make me breathe
And if you don’t like it - tough
You better leave

7. Expendable
I get professional pay
To make people go away
They got nothing to say
I’m expendable that’s my claim to fame
I’m expendable don’t have to know my name
Take a look into my dark side
Oh that’s a window to my soul
Your watching on the outside
Yea that’s all you people know
So bring a knife or a gun
And i’ll show you what their for
Both of them are fun
When the raven’s at your door
I’m expendable that’s my claim to fame
I’m expendable don’t have to know my name
Cause i will survive
With no one left around me
Cause your all gonna die
Together we ride
With vengeance inside
For our brother who died
We got blood on our minds
No we may not return
But many will burn
With a story to tell
How we took them to hell
I’m expendable that’s my claim to fame
I’m expendable don’t have to know my name

8. El Gringo
Don't look for me in Heaven
Don't look for me in Hell
Never taking me a live
I've got no soul to sell.

Don't look for me in prison
Don't try to save my soul
I'm a man without a country
And I've got no place to go.

You can say I'm just a gringo
You can say I'm just a man
I live outside the law
Doing anything I can.

I keep the laws I make
And I break the laws you keep.
I'm living on the edge.
Living on the street

Don't look for me in Heaven
Don't look for me in Hell
Never taking me alive
I've got no soul to sell.

Don't look for me in prison
Don't try to save my soul
I'm a man without a country
And I've got no place to go.

Each day I fight to live
I fight to stay alive.
Don't get in my way
Unless you want to die.

One who stands tall
Never stands alone.

[Solo]

Don't look for me in Heaven
Don't look for me in Hell
Never taking me alive
I've got no soul to sell.

Don't look for me in prison
Don't try to save my soul
I'm a man without a country
And I've got no place to go.

You can say I'm just a gringo
You can say I'm just a man
I live outside the law
Doing anything I can.

I keep the laws I make
And I break the laws you keep.
I'm living on the edge.
Living on the street.

Don't look for me in Heaven
Don't look for me in Hell
Never taking me alive
I've got no soul to sell.

Don't look for me in prison
Don't try to save my soul
I'm a man without a country
And I've got no place to go.

9. Annihilation
Another lie
Time to die
Another day
Blown away
Another scam
Show you who i am
Another day
Blown away
Hand of justice
Soon will be falling
Vengeance thine
Lord of steel
Annihilation
They will never win this fight
We have the power and the might
We have the sacred right
Feel the power here tonight
Hand of justice
Soon will be falling
Vengeance thine
Lord of steel
Annihilation
Live the life we truly feel
Fighting for the lord of steel
Heavy metal is my life
Heavy metal will never die

10. Hail, Kill And Die
On hymns of battle we rode to glory
Hail england did we
By the sign of the hammer
We fought the world
Kings of metal to be
Louder than hell
Warriors of the world
Now gods of war
Stand our ground knights immortal
For metal once more
Hail kill and die
On this ground for death and glory
Are all who believe
Blood and steel bound together
In a fight to be free
We will arm the just
And grind to dust
Those who deny
Our sacred right
Of glory and might
We shall survive
Hail kill and die
Hail kill and die
Dark avengers armed with hatred
Black arrows and wings
By the hammer of thor
A holy war
For the crown and the ring
We ride the dragon and wield the power
To fight til we die
Sons of odin stand so tall
We all touch the sky
Hail kill and die

11. The Kingdom Of Steel
INTO THY HANDS I COMMEND MY SOUL -

MANOWAR LYRICS


1. Thunder In The sky
[Joey DeMaio, Karl Logan]

If I had a name it has long been forgotten
Was I ever borm from who am I begotten
I walk into a storm white fire burns me
Death in every stop
A world of pain thatn learns me

When you see my eyes
the ground is shaking
your bones are breaking
When you see my eyes
there's thunder in the sky
and soon your gonna die

I will fight the curse
of the universe that damns me
Am I alive or dead
Among the gods and men
A man beast

Hammer in my hand
not the son of man burns me
Beyond the cold and pain
thunder wind and rain learns me

When you see my eyes
the ground is shaking
your bones are breaking
When you see my eyes
there's thunder in the sky
and soon your gonna die

How the cold wind
cuts me like a knife
filled with empatiness
Fighting for my life
thrust into a world
of pain and holy rage
So prepare to die
when you see the tunder in the sky
When you see my eyes
the ground is shaking
When you see my eyes
your bones are breaking
When you see my eyes
there's thunder in the sky
and soon your gonna die
When you see thunder

2. Let The Gods Decide
[Joey DeMaio, Karl Logan]

Warriors take the field
The battlefield of life
You cannot run
You cannot hide

I am the keeper of the laws
Decided by the Gods

Only one of us will win
and return to fight again

I am the keeper of the laws
Decided by the Gods

Our ancestors cheer
from far beyond the grave
One will survive
Face me
Then let the Gods decide

I've sworn an oath in blood to defend the land
and all who wish to test their steel well here I am

I am the keeper of the laws
Decided by the Gods

Our ancestors cheer
from far beyond the grave
One will survive
Face me
Then let the Gods decide

3. Father
[Joey DeMaio]

When I was small
You took me by the hand
Father you should know
I finally understand

You taught me wrong from right
And how to live
You gave the greatest gift
That one could give

You never let me down
You made me strong
When I made mistakes
When I was wrong

Some days we'd laugh
And some days we'd fight
Somehow you knew one day
I'd say you were right

You're with me
In every word I say
In every hour
Of every single day
In all I do
I'm just a part of you

You lived your life for us
That was your plan
Those hands that never take
They worked the land
Hands that never take
Can only give
And because of you
I know how to live

You're with me
In every word I say
In every hour
Of every single day
In all I do
I'm just a part of you

Father just one thing
You always knew
Every word you said to me was true

4. Die With Honor
[Joey DeMaio]

If I Should Return
With My Body On My Shield
Tell My Son I Chose To Die Than Yield
Though My Life May Soon Be Gone
I Hope You'll Carry On
Remember Me As One Who Would Not Kneel

Fight With Blood
Fight With Steel
Die With Honor
Never Yield
Fearless Hearts
Filled With Pride
Into Glory We Shall Ride
Into Glory We Shall Ride

I Am Driven On In The Face Of All Despair
Trust In Steel You Will Find Me There
A Sinner's Fate Awaits Me
But My Vision Guides Me On
I Will Not Stray
From The Path I'm Set Upon

I'll Fight With Blood
Fight With Steel
Die With Honor
Never Yield
Fearless Hearts
Filled With Pride
Into Glory We Shall Ride
Into Glory We Shall Ride

If I Do Not Return
Bring My Body On My Shield
Tell My Son I Chose To Die
I Chose To Die Than Yield

Fight With Blood
Fight With Steel
Die With Honor
Never Yield
Fearless Hearts
Filled With Pride
Into Glory We Shall Ride

Fight With Blood
Fight With Steel
Die With Honor
Never Yield
Fearless Hearts
Filled With Pride
Into Glory We Shall Ride

Fight With Blood
Fight With Steel
Die With Honor
Never Yield
Fearless Hearts
Filled With Pride
Into Glory We Shall Ride
I'll Die Fighting With My Brothers Side By Side

5. The Crown And The Ring (Lament Of The Kings) (Metal Version)
[Joey DeMaio]

From a battle I've come
To a battle I ride
Blazing up to the sky
Chains of fate
Hold a fiery stride
I'll see you again when I die

High and mighty alone we are kings
Whirlwinds of fire we ride
Providence brought us the crown and the ring
Covered with blood and our pride

Heroes await me
My enemies ride fast
Knowing not this ride's their last
Saddle my horse as I drink my last ale
Bow string and steel will prevail

High and mighty alone we are kings
Whirlwinds of fire we ride
Providence brought us the crown and the ring
Covered with blood and our pride

Odin, I await thee
Your true son am I
I hail you now as I die
I pledge you my sword and to no man I kneel
Ours is the kingdom of steel

High and mighty alone we are kings
Whirlwinds of fire we ride
Providence brought us the crown and the ring
Covered with blood and our pride

6. God Or Man
[Joey DeMaio, Karl Logan]

I arrive a stranger in this land and
Those who seek me their Blood will wash the land
They who need me now reach out their hand
And If she heals me will I be God or Man

Tell Me
Will I live or Die
Then tell me Why
Tell me who I am
God or Man

Step Aside
Where I ride
Or you will die

My protection I give to those in need
Mother, Son and Daughter and Father will be free
from the chains of death upon them
I shall end their misery
With Blood upon my Hammer
Now the wolves of men shall bleed

Tell Me
Will I live or Die
Then tell me Why
Now tell me who I am
God or Man

Step Aside
Where I ride
Or you will die

I'm Alive
And I know Why
Cause of Lies
For you will die

You'll know the curse of my pain
Thunder and Rain

My protection I give to those in need
Mother, Son and Daughter and Father will be free
From the chains of death upon them
I shall end their misery
With Blood upon my Hammer
Now the wolves of men shall bleed

Step Aside
Where I ride
Step Aside
Or you will die

I'm Alive
And I know Why
Cause of Lies
You will die

7. Tatko (Father - Bulgarian Version)
[Translated by Nelly Stefanova, dedicated to Stefan Evstatiev Kirkov]

Kagato malak biah
me hvana za raka -
tatko, osaznah
nai-setne i tova.

Nauchi me koe e
dobro i zlo -
to dar bezcenen be
v moia jivot.

Ne me podvede ti,
a prosvetli:
chrez greshkite mi -
me zakali.

V smiah i v razdori
letiaha dni...
Pozna, che niakoi den
shte znam - prav si ti!

Ti s men si
vav vsichki moi slova
i vseki chas
i den az te zova,
i znam, che az
ot teb sam prosto chast.

A ti jivia za nas
i v tvoia pat
otdade vseki chas
s jar na doma.

Vsichki ni dari
s chista liobov
i s race dobri
dade blagoslov.

Ti s men si
vav vsichki moi slova
i vseki chas
i den az te zova,
i znam, che az
ot teb sam prosto chast.

Tatko, veche znam -
prav beshe ti!
Tvoito slovo s plam
u men gori.

[Cyrillic]

Когато малък бях -
ме хвана за ръка.
Татко, осъзнах
най-сетне и това.

Научи ме кое е
добро и зло -
то дар безценен бе
в моя живот.

Не ме подведе ти,
а просветли;
чрез грешките ми -
ме закали.

В смях и в раздори
летяха дни...
Позна, че някой ден ден
ще знам - прав си ти!

Ти с мен си
във всички мои слова
и всеки час
и ден аз те зова,
и знам, че аз
от теб съм просто част.

А ти живя за нас
и в твоя път
отдаде всеки час
с жар на дома.

Всички ни дари
с чиста любов
и с ръце добри
даде благослов.

Ти с мен си
във всички мои слова
и всеки час
и ден аз те зова,
и знам, че аз
от теб съм просто част.

Татко, вече знам -
прав беше ти.
Твойто слово с плам
у мен гори.

8. Otac (Father - Croatian Version)
[Translated by Marina Grgic, dedicated to Goran Grgic]

Kad sam bio mali
Ti si me uzeo za ruku
Oce ti si trebao znati
Da sam ja konacno razumio

Naucio me lose od dobroga
I da zivim
Dao najbolji poklon
Sto bi mi iko mogao dati

Nikada me nisi razocarao
Napravio si me jacim
Kada sam pravio greske
Kada nisam bio u pravu

Nekada smo veseli
A nekada tuzni
Znao si jednoga dana
Ja cu priznati da si bio u pravu

Uvjek si sa mnom
U svakoj rjeci
U svakom satu
U svakom danu
U svemu sta radim
Ja sam dio tebe

Zivjeo si svoj zivot za nas
To je bio tvoj plan
Ruke sto nikada nisu uzimale
Uvjek su radile
Zbog tebe ja znam kako da zivim

Uvjek si sa mnom
U svakoj rjeci
U svakom satu
U svakom danu
U svemu sta radim
Ja sam dio tebe

Oce samo jos jedna stvar
Uvjek si znao
Svaku rjec koju si mi rekao bila je tacna

9. Isä (Father Finnish Version)
[Translated by Jan Yrdlun, dedicated to Nils Erik Yrdlun]

Kun olin pienoinen
Pidit kiinni kädestä
Isä, tietäisithän sen
Minä viimein ymmärrän

Opetit hyvän ja pahan,
Ohjeet elämään
Annoit parhaan lahjan
Sen tärkeimmän

Et hylännyt koskaan
Teit minusta vahvan
Kun menin harhaan
Tai en tiennyt suuntaa

Joskus naurettiin - ja
taas tapeltiin
Tiesit aina kuitenkin
Oikeassa olet niin

Osa sinua vaan
Sanoissa ja teoissa
Joka hetki joka aikaan
Kaikessa mitä teen
Ja minne meen
Osa sinua -- olen vaan

Elit meitä varten
Sinun suunnitelmaa
Kätesi töitä tehden
Oli luodut antamaan

Et vaatinut koskaan
Halusit vain antaa
Ja nyt tätä elämää
Tiedän miten elää

Osa sinua vaan
Sanoissa ja teoissa
Joka hetki joka aikaan
Kaikessa mitä teen
Ja minne meen
Osa sinua -- olen vaan

Isä, yksi asia
Sinä tiesit kai
Joka ainoa sana
Mitä sanoit
...totta oli vain

10. Mon Père (Father - French Version)
[Translated by Diana Baker, dedicated to Charles Shaffer]

Quand j'etais petit
Vous m'avez pris par la main
Pere vous devriez savoir
Je comprends finalement

Vous m'avez appris mal de droit
Et comment vivre
Vous avez donné le grand cadeau
Celui-là pourrait donner

Vous ne m'avez jamais déçu
Vous m'avez fait fort
Quand j'ai fait des erreurs
Quand j'avais tort

Quelques fois nous pleurons
Et quelques jours nous lutterions
D'une façon ou d'une autre vous saviez un jour
Je dirais vous aviez raison

Vous êtes avec moi
Dans chaque mot je dis
En chaque heure
De chaque jour seul
Dans tout je fais
Je suis une partie de vous

Votre vie pour nous
C'étais votre plan
Ces mains genereux
Travaillé la terre
Mains qui ne prennent jamais
Donner seulement
Et à cause de vous
Je sais comment vivre

Vous êtes avec moi
Dans chaque mot je dis
En chaque heure
De chaque jour seul
Dans tout je fais
Je suis juste une partie de vous

Pere juste une chose
Vouse saviez toujours
Chaque mot que vous avez dit à moi ètait vrai

11. Vater (Father - German Version)
Ich war noch klein
Und Deine Worte groß
Vater, jetzt verstehe ich erst
Was es bedeuten muss

Du hast den Weg gezeigt
Im Lebens-Labyrinth
Die große, weite Welt
War Dein Geschenk

Du warst immer da
Und gabst mir Kraft
Ohne Deine Liebe
Hätte ich's nicht geschafft

Wir haben uns gestritten
Und zusammen gelacht
Ich hatte schon geahnt
Wie recht Du hast

Zu jeder Zeit
Bist Du ein Teil von mir
In Ewigkeit
In jedem Wort von mir
Und was auch ist
Du bist immer da

Du hast Dein Leben für uns gelebt,
Die ganze Zeit
Ich hab's nicht gleich kapiert
Jetzt bin ich bereit

Du wolltest niemals nehmen
Gabst alles mir
Soviel Gutes getan
Soviel Sinn für mein Leben

Zu jeder Zeit
Bist Du ein Teil von mir
In Ewigkeit
In jedem Wort von mir
Und was auch ist
Du bist immer da

Vater, nur noch eins
Ich danke Dir
Jedes Deiner Worte
Ist jetzt ein Teil von mir

12. Πατερα (Father - Greek Version)
[Translated by Makis Kyrkos, dedicated to Yiannis Kyrkos]

Μικρό παιδί
Με πήρες απ' το χέρι
Πατέρα, να σου πω
Τώρα καταλαβαίνω

Είδα καλό από κακό
Μου έμαθες να ζω
Το πιο μεγάλο δώρο
Που μπορούσα να δεχτώ

Ποτέ δεν μ' έβλαψες
Μ΄έκανες δυνατό
Όταν είχα λάθος
Και δεν ήμουν σωστός

Μέρες με γέλιο
Κι' άλλες με καβγά
Μα γνώριζες, μια μέρα
"'Εχεις δίκιο", θα σ' έλεγα

Μαζί μου
Στη κάθε λέξη μου
Της κάθε ώρας
Κάθε ημέρας
Σ' ότι κάνω
Είμαι, μέρος σου

Η ζωή μας, ζωή σου
Βάση σχεδίου
Και πάντα πρόθυμα
Δούλεψες σκληρά

Χέρια φιλόξενα
Μόνο παρέχουν
Και για χάρη σου
Έμαθα να ζω

Μαζί μου
Στη κάθε λέξη μου
Της κάθε ώρας
Κάθε ημέρας
Σ' ότι κάνω
Απλά, μέρος σου

Πατέρα, μια στιγμή
Πάντοτε γνώριζες
Κάθε λέξη σου, ήταν αληθινή

[Roman letters]

13. Apa (Father - Hungarian Version)
[Translated by Bernadett Döme, dedicated to József Döme]

Még gyermek voltam
Te fogtad a kezem
Apa, tudnod kell
Végül megértem

Te tanítottál
Hogy miként adjak
Legszebb ajándék
Mit bárki kaphat

Letörni nem hagytál
Erőssé tettél
Mikor hibáztam
Te nem tévedtél

Sokat nevettünk
Néha összevesztünk
De tudtad egy napon
Még bevallom

Benne élsz
Minden kimondott szóban
Minden nap
Minden órájában
Minden mit teszek
A részedként teszem

Értünk éltél életet
Ez volt a terv
Azok a kezek
Sosem vettek el

Kezek, mik nem vesznek el
Csak adni élnek
Mert Tőled tudom,
Én miként éljek

Benne élsz
Minden kimondott szóban
Minden nap
Minden órájában
Minden mit teszek
A részedként teszem

Apa, egy gondolat
Te mindig tudtad
Szavad, mi nekem szólt, mind
Igaz volt

14. Padre (Father - Italian Version)
[Translated by Matteo Bartolotta & Patrizia Lafler, dedicated to Matteo Bartolotta]

In verde eta'
Mi hai preso per la mano
Padre ora lo sai
Che non e' stato invano

Mi hai insegnato bene
A sapere vivere
Mi hai dato il dono
Piu' grande che c'e'

Non mi hai mai deluso
Mi hai reso forte
Tra i miei affanni
E i miei errori

A volte ridere
A volte combattere
Ma tu sapevi che
Ti avrei dato ragione

Sei con me
Nelle mie parole, ogni ora con me
In tutto quel che faccio
Vivi in me
Io sono parte di te

Vivesti per noi
Il piano era questo
Le tue mani generose
Lavoran la terra

Infaticabili mani
San solo dare
E ringrazio te
Oggi so vivere

Sei con me
Nelle mie parole, ogni ora con me
In tutto quello che faccio
Vivi in me
Io sono parte di te

Padre, un' ultima cosa
Tu hai sempre saputo
Che quello che hai detto
Era vero

15. 父 (Father - Japanese Version)

16. Far (Father - Norwegian Version)
Da jeg var barn
Holdt du i min hånd
Far, du må vite
At jeg nå ser

Du skilte rett fra galt
Vi så livets gang
Du gav oss det som var
Mulig å gi

Aldri skuffet du
Du gjorde meg sterk
Da jeg tok feil
Da jeg gikk feil

Vi kunne le og
Vi kunne sloss
Du forstod dog ennå
Min tillit til deg

Du er med meg
I alle mine ord
Enhver time
Av hver eneste dag
Alt jeg gjør
Er jeg en del av deg

Du gav ditt liv for oss
Det var ditt mål
Hender som aldri tok
De viste vei

Hender som aldri tar
Kan bare gi
Du satte ditt preg
På våre liv

Du er med meg
I alle mine ord
Enhver time
Av hver eneste dag
Alt jeg gjør
Er jeg en del av deg

Far, en ting du alltid har visst
Alt det du sa til meg var sant

17. Ojciec (Father - Polish Version)
[Translated by Bart Gabriel, dedicated to Marcin Gabriel]

Gdym mały był
Na ręce brałeś mnie
Ojcze, czy już wiesz
Iż wreszcie rozumiem Cię

Co dobre jest co złe
pokazałeś mi
Dałeś największy dar
Wiem jak mam żyć

I nie zawiodłeś mnie
Dodałeś mi sił
Kiedym czynił źle
- uczyłeś mnie

Czasem przez śmiech
Czasem przez łzy
Tyś wiedział o tym dniu
Kiedy rację przyznam Ci

Tyś jest tu
I w każdym słowie mym
Słyszę Cię
I w każdym czynie mym
I w każdym dniu
Żyjesz w sercu mym

Zyłes tylko dla nas
To był Twój plan
To praca twoich rąk
Dobro niosła nam

Ty wiedziałeś i
Ja teraz wiem
Skąd mam przykład brać
I wiem jak mam żyć

Tyś jest tu
I w każdym słowie mym
Słyszę Cię
I w każdym czynie mym
I w każdym dniu
Żyjesz w sercu mym

Ojcze, ja już wiem
I Tyś wiedział, że
Każde ze słow twych, w końcu sprawdzi się

18. Pai (Father - Portuguese Version)
[Translated by Manoel Arruda, dedicated to Severino José de Arruda]

Quando era jovem
Mostrou-me o que fazer
Pai, saiba agora
consigo entender

Mostrou-me o bem e o mal
Como viver
Deu-me o maior presente
Que algém pode ter

Não me desapontou
Me fortaleceu
Sempre que falhei
Se o erro era meu

Rimos juntos
Choramos também
Ensinou-me lições
Sempre pro meu bem

Estás aqui
Em cada palavra
O tempo todo, aqui
Em tudo que faço
Me faz crescer
Só tenho que agradecer

Viveste para nós
Assim planejaste
Tuas mãos generosas
Na terra trabalhaste

Tuas mãos generosas
Só podem dar
E graças à você
Sei como viver

Estás aqui
Em cada palavra
O tempo todo, aqui
Em tudo que faço
Me faz crescer
Só tenho que agradecer

Pai, só algo mais
Saibas pra sempre
Cada palavra tua, foi verdade

19. Tată (Father - Romanian Version)
[Translated by Ruxandra Sandru & Sorin Lipoveanu, dedicated to Dorin Sandru]

Am fost mic,
Tu m-ai luat de mână
Tată, vreau să ştii,
Suntem împreună.

Mi-ai spus ce-i rău şi ce-i bine
Şi-am învăţat:
Nimeni nu-mi poate da
Ce tu mi-ai dat.

M-ai făcut puternic,
M-ai sprijinit,
Când m-am înşelat,
Sau am greşit.

Ne-a fost şi bine,
Ne-am şi certat
Acum pot s-o spun:
M-am înşelat.

Cu mine,
În orice clipă din orice oră,
În fiecare zi în tot ce-i bine
Sunt parte din tine!

Ai trăit pentru noi,
Te-ai străduit,
Cu braţele tale,
Din greu ai muncit.

Nimic nu ai cerut,
Ai oferit.
Datorită ţie,
Am reuşit!

Cu mine,
În orice clipă din orice oră,
În fiecare zi în tot ce-i bine
Sunt parte din tine!

Tată,
Un lucru spun:
Sunt împăcat
Că tot ce ai spus e adevărat

20. Padre (Father - Spanish Version)
[Translated by Francisco Palomo, dedicated to Francisco Jose Puebla Rojas]

Cuando nací
tomaste tu mi mano
Padre, hoy por tí
Finalmente lo entiendo

Tu me enseñaste bien
como vivir
me diste el mas grande
Regalo de existir

No me dejas caer
me haces fuerte
cuando me equivoque
o tuve un error

Algunos días reímos
Otros peleamos
De un modo tu sabías
que hoy lo entendería

Vas en mí
en cada palabra
en cada hora (en mí)
en cada día
en todo lo que soy
solo, parte de tí

Viviste por nosotros
ese fue tu plan
tus manos incansables
la tierra trabajaron
Tus manos bondadosas
supieron dar
y gracias a tí
hoy,se como vivir

Vas en mí
en cada palabra
en cada hora (en mí)
en cada día
en todo lo que soy
solo, parte de tí

Padre, algo más
siempre sabras
cada palabra tuya,
Fue verdad

21. Baba (Father - Turkish Version)
[Translated by Erman Bora Atabay, dedicated to Aydin Atabay]

Beni küçükken
Elimden tuttun
Baba, bil isterim
Şimdi anladım

Suçtan hakkı böldün
Örnek oldun
Verdiğin bağış
Hepten üstün

Beni hiç kırmadın
Güçlendirdin
Yanlışım da olsa
Hatam olsa

Hem sevinir, hem
Savaşırdık
Sen yine bilirdin
Doğru olan sen

Benimlesin
Sözlerimde
Geçen zaman
Günün her vaktinde
Var olmam
Senin sayende

Bizlere yaşadın
Simdiye dek
O sağlam ellerin
Toprağı işletir
O sağlam ellerin
Almayıp verir
Senin sayende
Hayatı bildim

Benimlesin
Sözlerimde
Geçen zaman
Günün her vaktinde
Var olmam
Senin sayende

Baba, ben ve sen
Biliriz ki
Bana dedigin her söz doğru

MANOWAR LYRICS


1. Where No Life Dwells
[Instrumental]

2. Dead Forever
[Sep '90]

I detest your sanity
You're blinded by the light
Empty eyes of suffering
Get out of my life ...life
Take my hand and ride with me
Into the dark
I am the asexual
Tear out your heart ...heart
...Slow
Frightened by shadows
...You hide away
So weak in mind
...You fade away
Now your mind is dead forever
All left behind
Came to shake my hand again
Bow down and die!
Born to walk alone forever
I shall remain
Suffer now my child and see
I am insane! ...Insane

3. Before The Creation Of Time
[Jan '91]

Before the creation of time
When nothingness was all
And a fiery star's implosion
Caused the universe to fall
Worlds in utter chaos and plague
Were doomed to die at last
Vanished in the blackest void
A recreation of the past
Before the creation of time
When emptyness was all
Utter darkness enlights the way
To the surrounding walls
Journey through what mustn't be seen
To where no life dwells
Wisdom of the first creation
No one shall live to tell
Before the creation of time
When nothingness was all
And a blazing star's implosion
Caused the universe to fall
Memories of a frozen time beyond
There's nothing left to show
A new creation soon to be unleashed
In the shadowed depths below
Goodbye mother earth...

4. For They Shall Be Slain
[Nov '90]

Cursed are the lambs of god
For they shall be bled -
Whiter than the whitest snow
Christ is dead
Ancient lies - time to die
Cursed are the slaves of Islam
For they shall be slain
Religion of the lowest minds
Allah is dead
Ancient lies - time to die
Eternally their eyes shall bleed
For they shall be torn out
Vassals of a blind belief
Ancient dead
Ancient lies - time to die

5. If They Had Eyes (The Watchers Of The Earth)
If they had eyes
All they would have witnessed
Creature from the sea
Neanderthal to be...
Man has conquered athra
And to all the gods he gave birth
Though mountains of the dead
Are the watchers of the earth...
...High above the clouds
...Standing tall in might
...Darkness surrounds
...The mountain side
If they had eyes
All they would have witnessed
Creature from the sea
Evil men to be...

6. The Dark One
[Dec '89]

Stalking through the utter dark
Evil eyes glow in the distance
Prepared for a battle in rage
The end for the cruel adventurer
Blow to side - strike through eye
A battle-axe wields to charge
And separates head from body
Darkest blood flowing free
My eyes are filled with pleasure
Blow to side - strike through eye
A hunt for an ancient treasure
No herbs to restore his life
To die by an orchish arrow
Victorious the olog-hai
Slow you'll die - the dark one smiles

7. Into Glory Ride
[Oct '90]

Once upon
An evil time
Up in the north
Mighty men
Fought and died
By the sword
...Onward into glory ride
Into battle
Sign of the hammer
Be my guide
Standing proud
In victory
Into glory ride
...Onward into glory ride
To Birka we sail
(Birch Island)
And celebrate
Hail Thor
And the fallen
Join with Odin
At slain hall
(Valhalla)
...Onward into glory ride

8. ...And The Laughter Has Died
[Dec '90]

Man of fashions flow - die
Time has come to say - goodbye
We spit on your - grave
Slay all in sight - rage
All their power's gone
A battle we have won
No more trust to them
This is the end
So is the utterdark - revenge
And now the laughter has - died

9. Unleashed
[Music April '90, lyrics Nov '90]

When they bring us holy water
We'll tear 'em down to the core
The cross of weakness burns to ashes
And Jesus Christ is no more
This is the way - we're unleashed
So they named us evil men
Evil minded yes we are
Living proud by the law of nature
By the hammer into war
This is the way - we're unleashed
...Join our side and we'll crush the enemy
When they bring us holy water
We'll tear 'em down to the core
The cross of weakness burns to ashes
And Jesus Christ is no more
Tsirhcitna - he's unleashed
...Beware...

10. Violent Ecstasy
[Feb '90]

I - am my own god and master
No one - will take my soul away
I - will rise in stern invasion
Die - the enemy I slay
Choose side, follow mine - take his fuckin' life
I - will enter no path of decay
Stabbing the dagger in their eye
I - will tear 'em down, for all to see
My revenge of all the false in mind
Choose side, follow mine - take his fuckin' life
I will set it free
Violent ecstasy
I will set it free
Violent ecstasy
I - am my own god and master
No one - will take my soul away
I - will rise in stern invasion
Die - the enemy I slay
Choose side, follow mine - take his fuckin' life

11. Where Life Ends
[July '90]

God of lies,
Slaughter and sacrifice
We spit in his face
And laugh as we die
...Where life ends
Mother Christ -
Your son we crucified
On a path to hell -
We choose to live our lives
...Where life ends
Where is the gate
To heaven of glory bright?
Vanished in the dark,
Where is the promised light?

1. The Final Silence
[Music - Fredrik/Johnny; Lyrics - Johnny]

No more shall we pray for peace
Never ever ask them why
No more shall we stop their visions
Of selfdestructing genocide
Dogs on leads march to war
Go ahead end it all...

Blow up the world
The final silence
Blow up the world
I don't give a damn!

Screams of terror, panic spreads
Bombs are raining from the sky
Bodies burning, all is dead
There's no place left to hide
Dogs on leads march to war
Go ahead end it all...

Blow up the world
The final silence
Blow up the world
I don't give a damn!

(A voice was heard from the battle field)

"Couldn't care less for a last goodbye
For as I die, so do all my enemies
There's no tomorrow, and no more today
So let us all fade away..."

Upon this ball of dirt we lived
Darkened clouds now to dwell
Wasted years of man's creation
The final silence now can tell
Dogs on leads march to war
Go ahead end it all...

Blow up the world
The final silence
Blow up the world
I don't give a damn!

2. The Immortals
[Music - Johnny; Lyrics - Johnny]

Rise - my armies - with power - from Hell - we march...

When all their power's gone and nothing's left but shame
We are the evil ones, a pestilence they say
We tear their souls apart by just being what we are
...And to forever be the ones to blame

There's nothing here for us in their world of love and trust
We vomit in their eyes and face them with disgust
We are the tyrants of the darkness as they say
...And we will never obey

So rise - my armies - with power - from Hell - we march...

We leave your god behind, he's shaking with fright
See the hatred in our eyes shining so bright
Possessed by Hell itself we stand up to charge
...And rise from the flames

This is the time for vengeance, now their end is near
We strike with hateful power, we have no fear
We are the immortals of a never ending race
...And we shall fight 'til the end

Now the time has come
For all the fools to pray
Come on, face the slayer
Now's your time to pay

So rise - immortals - with power - and might - we slay...

3. A Life Beyond
[Music - Fredrik; Lyrics - Johnny]

A life beyond reality, a must to reach the only way out
So distant to this rotten world and I know - it isn't for me
I don't care of what they say, I am myself and live my own way
Like rats they run in life's eternal wheel - but they'll never
get me

Hear the silent whispers, all the talking heads and see all
their fake smiles
Protected by a wall of laws they hide - they dare not face me
Talking in circles to start confusion
(but empty words they fly through my mind)
With all their lies and prophecies they try - but they'll
never get me

... They'll never get me

With staring eyes they follow me
(it seems to be the peak of their lives)
I hate you all, why can't you fuckin' see - you cannot scare
me
Like an image passin' by I see it ends the day that I die
Until then I'll have powers left to fight - they'll never get
me

... They'll never get me

All that's left to say... as I turn away
I hate you all... and I will 'til I fall!!

A life beyond reality, a must to reach the only way out
So distant to this rotten world and I know - it isn't for me
I don't care what they say, I am myself and live my own way
Like rats they run in life's eternal wheel - but they'll never
get me

... They'll never get me

4. Shadows In The Deep
[Music - Fredrik; Lyrics - Johnny]

Shadows in the deep, once flesh and blood
Promised to finally see the light
Taking farewell of this life's mortal Hell
Hope to face the master, his blessings to tell
But lost are the souls who gaze into void
In search for a life beyond the grave

Still shadows bleed... eternally

Shadows in the deep, longing for life
Endlessly regretting the search for the light
The mortal life is gone but still shadows bleed
Tortured are the souls from a life without sins
An eternal wait for bodily ecstasy
To revel in lust, anger and greed

Still shadows bleed... eternally

Shadows in the deep, not for man to see
Captured here forever, never to be free
Taking farewell of this life's mortal Hell
Hope to face the master, his blessings to tell
But lost are the souls who gaze into void
In search for a life beyond the grave

Beyond the grave... shadows still bleed... eternally

5. Countess Bathory
[Lant / Dunn / Bray]
[These words taken from Venom's original version]

Wellcoming the virgin's fair,
to live a noble life
In the castle known to all
The Count's infernal wife

She invites the peasants
with endless lavish foods
But, when evening spreads its wings
She rapes them of their blood

Countess Bathory
Countess Bathory

All day long the virgins sit
Feast on endless meals
The Countess laughs and sips her wine
Her skin both crack and peel

But when nighttime fills the air
One must pay the price
The Countess takes her midnight bath
with blood that once gave life

Countess Bathory
Countess Bathory

(Countess)

Countess Bathory
Countess Bathory

Living in her self-styled hell
the Countess dressed in black
Life so distant, death so near
no blood to turn time back

The castle walls are closing in
She's crippled now with age
Welcomes death with open arms
The Reaper turns the page

Countess Bathory
Countess Bathory

6. Never Ending Hate
[Music - Johnny; Lyrics - Johnny]

Mindless people without a face
Cannot stand our human race
So they call us left behind
We laugh with pride, stand and fight

Never ending hate

Politicians in the lead
Empty brains they will feed
Never trust'em not a sound
Slay'em down to the ground

Never ending hate

Try to make us compromise
Listen fast simple minds!
No pretending, we don't care
Bangin' heads everywhere

Never ending hate

Try to push us off the way
Here and now is the time to slay -
The lowest form of human life
Are fashion wimps with lying eyes
With crushing power from within
Every battle we shall win
Man of clay say goodbye
We're unleashed step aside!

Never ending hate

7. Onward Into Countless Battles
[Music - Johnny; Lyrics - Johnny]

Off we sail from Svea shores
To test our steel through out the world
Soon to come a raging battle
The strong will join and the weak shall fall
The army of immortals rise
To seek revenge of all the false
So we raise the hammer high
And call to Odin for a sign...

Join us in this holy war
Against the world and all it stands for
Crush the men of fashion's flow,
The slaves of Christ and the thrells of Islam
Riding on the blackest wind
We can't be stopped, we cannot fail
So we raise the horn of pride
And drink to glory and victory...

Onward into countless battles
We took the crown from sacred land
Soon return to Birka shores
Through storm, rain and hellish waters
Men of power, strength and might
Were born to live forever more
So we raise the hammer high
And call to Thor for a sign...

8. Crush The Skull
[Music - Johnny; Lyrics - Johnny]

Preachers of the ancient lies
Hypocrisy the golden rule
I'm laughing with sardonic wrath
At each of your ten commands

Crush the skull - sacrifice
Crush the skull - die Christ

Cursed are the poor in spirit
For they shall be spat upon
Cursed are the weak in mind
For they shall inherit the yoke

Crush the skull - sacrifice
Crush the skull - die Christ

I gaze into his glassy eyes
And pluck him by the beard
I uplift a broadaxe
And split open his worm eaten skull

Crush the skull - sacrifice
Crush the skull - die Christ

Blessed are the strong in mind
For they shall possess the earth
Blessed are the evil ways
(the sins of life)
For they shall enlight the blind

Crush the skull - sacrifice
Crush the skull - die Christ

9. Bloodbath
[Music - Johnny; Lyrics - Johnny]

Eyes cry
How nice
Screams of pain
Am I insane?

...Bloodbath

To hunt the prey
Makes my day
Break the bones
Blood flows

Torn apart
Sliced heart
Stench from Hell
I can tell

...Bloodbath

Cries - I hear nothing but - cries
Blood - I see nothing but - blood

...Bloodbath

Night fall
Victim crawl
Once again
I demand

...Bloodbath

Pain - I give nothing but - pain
Joy - I feel nothing but - joy

...Bloodbath

10. Land Of Ice
[Music - Johnny; Lyrics - Johnny]

Silent nights
Under the winter sky
In the land of ice
Where the snow is white
Silent nights
And the northern breeze
In the land of ice
Where my soul is free

...My land of ice

Silent nights
On my ancestors ground
In the land of ice
Where the hooves of Sleipnir pound
Silent nights
And the oath is sworn
In the land of ice
As my son is born

...My land of ice

Silent nights
Where all shadows lay
In the land of ice
Oh, so far away
Silent nights
Where my eyes can see
In the land of ice
I shall rest in peace

Down he rode from the hills where he was born
With sword and shield and baatle axe in hand
Young and strong he was the chosen one
To lead the armies and to defend his land
The day had come to kill the intruders
By the shore, the enemies now stand
ODIN GUIDE MY SWORD
AND I'LL SLAY THE ENEMY
ODIN GUIDE MY SWORD
TO ETERNAL VICTORY
Strenghtened by the words of his own father:
Son, you must be merciless and brave!
Never let them take an inch of land,
No, he'd never let his family be raped
Never let them march upon his fields,
No, he's never let his people be enslaved
ODIN GUIDE MY SWORD
AND I'LL SLAY THE ENEMY
ODIN GUIDE MY SWORD
TO ETERNAL VICTORY
Thor of might now throws his hammer in wrath
Thunder roar the lightning strikes the sky
Now the battle rages into chaos
Blood is running strong and the valkyries fly
Finally the defender stands victorious
And Vlahalla awaits for the brave who died
ODIN GUIDE MY SWORD
AND I'LL SLAY THE ENEMY
ODIN GUIDE MY SWORD
TO ETERNAL VICTORY

5. In The Name Of God
In the name of God
A preacher rapes a child
He puts his hand
On top of his little head
He says: My son
You mustn't be afraid
I am your friend
In the name of God
He now takes off his clothes
Caresses his legs
So gently with his hands
He says: My son
You mustn't be afraid
I am your friend
(You have to trust me)
He says yeah
SUCK ON THIS OR ROT IN HELL
In the name of God
He now pools out his tool
And smiles, it hurts,
He enters from behind
He says: My son
You mustn't be afraid
I am your friend
In the name of God
When the blood is flowing free
And on the floor
The helpless body lies
He says: My son
There is the will of God
(You must have a faith)
HE SAYS YEAH
SUCK ON THIS OR ROT IN HELL
Religious harmony fills the air
Where the helpless bodylies
The erected member now was satisfied
God's messiah have had this way

Embrace the silence at night
Come lust and beauty great

7. Berserk
One thousand years ago
In this land of ice and snow
Man lived with hatred just like me
The wrath lives on eternally
BERSERK
Feel no pain, there's only hate
No regret, it's all too late
I see your face, it's all I need
To grind you down and watch you bleed

I leave you trashed, for all to see
Berserk in me, eternally

9. Against The World
AGAINST THE WORLD
He was alone against the world
An outcast ever since birth
On and on night and day
They told him to behave
You must fit into society
Oh, how he tried but could not agree
Be like us and follow trends
No, he'd rather fight 'till the end
AGAINST THE WORLD
AGAINST THE WORLD
He was alone against the world
Every day a slave at work
Be a man don't make a sound!
Oh, he tried to tear him down
So he was one of a kind
But theycould not control his mind
And he knew the day will come
To take revenge on every one
AGAINST THE WORLD

10. Revenge
Doomed for all eternity
Cause I never could agree
A normal life I will deny
Do not bother asking why!
From the shadows where I dwell
Here's my way to give you hell
REVENGE
Years have passed and I'm still alive
Censorship is a fascist lie
A thousand times I'll rise again
You can't escape my last revenge
For all the times you've let me down
I'll crush your face into the ground
REVENGE
REVENGE
Come forth on precious hate
My vengeance is your fate
Come feel my last revenge
So painful until the end
REVENGE
REVENGE
REVENGE

1. To Asgaard We Fly
Guided by my father's call
End of search, I hear them all
Now my quest is to live your dream
Land of the free passed on to me

I hail to thee on precious land
Brave & grand so strong she stands
Reaching from the mountains high
Down to the woods where the ravens fly

To asgaard we fly
The spirit will never die

I gaze across the open sea
Ships return but soon to leave
For all the men in battle slain
Let their spirits guide the way

Warrior of faith and pride
A spirit that can never die
With sword & shield I stand on guard
I'll fight til'death, we'll never part

To asgaard we fly
The spirit will never die

Guided by my father's call
End of search, I hear them all
Now my quest is to live your dream
Land of the free passed on to me

Brave & grand so strong she stands
Reaching from the mountains high
Down to the woods where the ravens fly

To asgaard we fly
The spirit will never die

Evil wrath
Live forever
Deep inside
Strong as ever
Growing hate
Rising higher
Open wide
Spit forth fire

Silent churning

Arise like steam
Reaching higher
Free at last
A strom of powers

Evil wrath
Live forever
Deep inside
Strong as ever
Growing hate

Hear my holy lies
I fool the poor & weak
To the light they seek
I sell the blessings for
50 dollars more

I am god
I kill people just for pleasure

I love to see them cry
And watch them slowly die
I lead every war
Trust in me for a better score
I don't care at all
If they stand or fall

I am God
I kill people just for pleasure

I plot a way for the destruction
Of the earth
To plague, starvation and diseases
I gave birth
I let them all die, cause my will
Is the law
The bullets of war are all mine

I am Jesus Christ
Can't tou see the light?
I preach the holy way
Join or be my prey

Cannot be this way
Must stay out of range

I am the psychopath
I live in my own world
I'll be the one you fear
...the one insane

So a doktor said
It was the best for me
To give me coloured pills

So I hit him with a hetchet
And ran from my cell
Need no special cure
To try keep my well

...the one insane

5. Across The Open Sea
[INSTRUMENTAL]

6. In The Northern Lands
Gods on high, behold...!
To thee I reach for might

Long ago in the northern lands
They sacrificed for might
Brothers Three who killed to give
Mortals land and sea
Midgaards rose from giant's flesh
Slaughtered to give life
Hail to the allseeing,
He who for wisdom gave his eye

Gods on high, behold...!
To thee I reach for might

The ravens flay across the plains
TO tell their master's tales
Tales beyond narrow minds
Weak lambs led astray
Our gift of blood & life to thee
O ancient heathen gods
Therefore now to thee we give
This human sacrifice

Gods on high, behold...!
To thee I reach for might

Long ago in the northern lands
They sacrificed for might
Brothers Three who killed to give
Mortals land and sea
Midgaards rose from giant's flesh
Slaughtered to give life
Hail to the allseeing,
He who for wisdom gave his eye

7. Forever Goodbye (2045)
Memories of a troubled past
Appears before my eyes
It seems to be the very last
I see before I fly
High above the earth and soon
To reach another day
The good old 1995
Is now just a memory

...goodbye

Flying high above the sky
As the planet burns
A journey to another world
There is no return
Visions are dancing in my mind
Of pictures never seen
Where the day and night are one
And life just cannot be

...goodbye

From the end of the universe
I scream in endless vain
I've realized I never will
See the sun again
I wonder as the hours pass
If someone will ever find
This message from another time
2045...

...forever... goodbye

8. Execute Them All
As my final call
Sounds the charge
...to war

I hate the universe and everything inside
I detest all I see, nothing pleases my mind

Execute them all
It's my final war

I hate the sight of you, fashion fake
Joke
I detest every man who cannot stand
Alone

Execute them all
It's my final war

As my final call
Sounds the charge
...to war

I hate the tales you tell, I don't
Believe a word
I detest the stuf you sell, I'll hunt
You around the world

Execute them all
It's my final war

When my days are numbered you'll hear
My final call
I'll take their lives away, I'll execute
Them all

Execute them all
It's my final war

Execute them all
It's my final war

9. Captured
I see the morning light breaking in
Another day, another hell within
Yesterday's sorrows come creeping by
Soon to remind my of tomorrow's lies
I gasp for air I scream for sight
Haven't seen anything yet that seems
To be right
I see the rats run their endless race
As I wake up to face another day...
(I must get... out)

...I'm captured

I see the darkness slowly fall
Into my room as I tear at the walls
And as a million dreams come sweeping by
Soon they will vanish like scattered lies
I reach for light but I cannot flee
An empty reality as all I see
I watch the mutants run their endless race
As I try to forget yet another day...
(I must get... out)

...I'm captured

I see the morning light breaking in
Another day, another hell within
Yesterday's sorrows come creeping by
Soon to remind my of tomorrow's lies
I gasp for air I scream for sight
Haven't seen anything yet that seems
To be right
I see the rats run their endless race
As I wake up to face another day...
(I must get... out)

...I'm captured

10. Breaking The Law
[Originally performed by Judas Priest]

The road was completely wasting
Out of working down
All inside it's so first rating
As I turn in town in town
Fill that nobody care
Is darling watch out
Nothing could begin
To put action in my wife

Breaking the law

So much further don't do future
I kept it even start
How on break promise broken
Aching my heart
You don't know what is life
You don't have a clue
If you need you be yourself
Do the same thing too

Breaking the law

You don't know what is the life

11. The General
Up he rose & forth they went
Into the battleground, fortress, tent
Mountains, wilderness, fielsd & farm
The soldier & the general arm in arm

Off they ride
Side by side

"Through the travail of ages
Midst the pomp & toils of war
Have I fought, strove and perished
Countless times under the stars
As it through a glass and darkly
The ageal stripe I see
I fought in many guises, many names
But it was always me..."

Off they ride
Side by side

I was there in...
Lived & died...

So up he rose & forth they went
Into the battleground, fortress, tent
Mountains, wilderness, fielsd & farm
The soldier & the general arm in arm

Off they ride
Side by side

Too long you've slandered our name
And dragged us all in the dust
Arguments of incompetence
Are easily returned and crushed

The legions of Hell are here

Smoke is rising from the mountain
The mountain of doom
A great eye, lidless, wrapped in flame
On the tower of Barad-Dûr
We must join with him
We must join with Sauron
Or we have chosen death

We must join with him

His gaze goes through

Earth and through flesh
The lord of Mordor sees it all
Gathering all evil without rest

We must join with Sauron

On the endless path of war
We may be torn and beat
But we have sworn to stand as one
In victory or defeat

We are the immortals
From Hell we rise

We are the immortals
Death Metal - No compromise!
We are the immortals
From Hell we rise
We are the immortals
Death Metal - No compromise!

6. Triumph Of Genocide
Civilian killing squads
With clubs and machetes
So the killing starts
There is no escape
From the interahamwe
Clubbed, burned and raped

The triumph of genocide
The United Nations stood aside
And watched the triumph of genocide

Bodies floating down
The Kigara river
Tied, hacked and drowned
Average killing rate
Thousands by the day
The UN evacuates

The triumph of genocide
The United Nations stood aside
And watched the triumph of genocide

7. The Avenger
Upon this land his forefathers walked
The call from the past
That warms his heart
Decades pass by, the changing of time
Still there's a fire that burns inside

Odin... Hear my call!
Odin... Hear my call!

The struggle to survive
The seeds he has sown
All he has built can soon be gone
The deeds of white Christ
Which must be avenged
He summons the Gods,
for courage and strength

Odin... Hear my call!
Odin... Hear my call!

The cold wind blows
And the hour draws near
He must stand his ground
With shield and spear
Its time for the warrior
To defend his kin
For a new dawn to rise
Its a battle he must win

Odin... Hear my call!
Odin... Hear my call!
Odin... Hear my call!
Odin... Hear my call!

8. Salvation For Mankind
Stolen from a Roman cave
By a follower in need
Of a selfish holy tale
To plant the Christian seed
Took the bones and ran away
Resurrection is the sign
Soon he'll come to us again
It's salvation for mankind

Yeah, resurrect so I can vomit on the
The body of Christ
Yeah, resurrect so I can vomit on the
The body of Christ

Don't you see the holy sign?
Its an act of God you've seen
Here's the proof, an empty tomb
Not a thing to be revealed!
Millions praying all in vain
For the secret to unwind
Waiting for the second coming
It's salvation for mankind

Yeah, resurrect so I can vomit on the
The body of Christ
Yeah, resurrect so I can vomit on the
The body of Christ

9. Psycho Killer
I'm all that you want me to be
Yeah, read about me soon
I drink the blood of babies fresh
I am impending doom
I kill for pleasure yes I do
Or is it out of greed?
Another day, another death
I'm what the public needs

I am a psycho killer
I am a psycho killer

The politicians love me too
I am a human shame
For unemployment and inflation
I am the one to blame
I'm a star in the evening news
A lamb left to die
Another story covered up
Some other fucking lie

I am a psycho killer
I am a psycho killer

I drink the blood of a newborn child
I'm all about death
I kill for pleasure yes I do
I confess

I am a psycho killer
I am a psycho killer

10. The Witch
Dressed in black, a flame from Hell
You feel her presence all too well
She'll take you for a magic ride
To Hell and back with legs astride
She'll take all that she needs
Leave your mind and soul to bleed

Dressed in black, a flame from Hell
The witch has casted her spell

Domination, lust will reign
Her lions are aflame
The nectar mixed with sweat
Dripping from her eager cleft
Shall act as pollen rain
To your slumbering brain

Dressed in black, a flame from Hell
The witch has casted her spell

11. I Have Sworn Allegiance
Welcome warriors of Unleashed
Tonight is our time to feast
You know its always worth the wait
Lets drink to Thor and celebrate

I have sworn allegiance
I have sworn allegiance
I have sworn allegiance

We've traveled far to prove our faith
No sacrifice can be too great
Our home is this Viking hall
United we shall stand or fall

I have sworn allegiance
I have sworn allegiance
I have sworn allegiance

Odin bade me his welcome
Into his hall of the slain
To reserve a place for the faithful ones
The immortals - The warriors of Unleashed
Who all swore to stand as one... forever
To you I have sworn, to you I have sworn
I have sworn allegiance eternally

12. Age Of The Warrior
Decades of despair, Christian decadence
And human defeat
Where no life dwells a new power grew
Like shadows in the deep
Immortal spirits bred in Hell
In time, all will see

It's the age of the warrior
The age of the warrior
The age of the warrior

Across the open sea, from land to land
It was time for victory
They fight so proud, with a warrior spirit
As Hell's unleashed
The have sworn allegiance,
With loyalty and pride
In time, all will see

It's the age of the warrior
The age of the warrior
The age of the warrior

13. New Dawn Rising
Join us in this great adventure
Our common time on earth
To make the best of what you've got
For better or for worse
Tomorrow shall belong to you
Stand up and face the world

New dawn rising
New dawn rising

We are the ones to write the pages
Of coming history
Deadly metal onward pounding
Innovative and free
So behold the new dawn rising
A new creation is unleashed

New dawn rising
New dawn rising

14. Loyalty And Pride
A man of the ancient way
From a barren land he came
With a spirit forged of steel
To become a man that never kneels
To anyone or anything
His strength lies deep within

The mark of faith
He wears with pride
The Hammer is his sign
The mark of faith
He wears with pride
The Hammer is his sign

The Hammer is his sign
Of loyalty and pride
A Viking warrior of today
From any land from any place
Holding his head up high
Through war and troubled times

The mark of faith
He wears with pride
The Hammer is his sign
The mark of faith
He wears with pride
The Hammer is his sign

With a mind of honest deeds
And a spirit that is free
He'll fight for kin and tribe
With them he'll live and die

15. Valhalla Awaits
The battle is over
Blood covers the plain
Courage is proven
Brave men died this day

Oh the Valkyries fly
To choose from those who died
Oh the Valkyries fly

Valhalla awaits

Choosers of the slain
Honor the brave men's call
Soon the Einheriar
Rise again in Odin's hall

Oh the Valkyries fly
To choose from those who died
Oh the Valkyries fly

Valhalla awaits

1. Winterland
Forest silent waiting
Frozen winter breeze
Snowfall ever lasting
Covers mountains and fields
Ice... cold... winterland
Ice... cold... winterland
The mighty Thor has spoken
Autumns final breath
The dying of all living
The triumph of nature & death
Ice... cold... winterland
Ice... cold... winterland
Ice... cold... winterland
Ice... cold... winterland

2. Destruction (Of The Race Of Men)
Saruman commands his army
An army of 10000 strong
To march upon the land of Rohan
A war on man that must be won
From Isengard the Uruk-Hai march off to war
For destruction, destruction
For destruction of the race of men
Isengard has been unleashed
The Uruk-Hai march to war
They will leave no one alive
Helm's deep is soon to fall
From Isengard the Uruk-Hai march off to war
For destruction, destruction
For destruction of the race of men
Destruction, for destruction
For destruction of the race of men
"A new power is rising
It's victory is at hand"
"There will be no dawn of men"
Destruction, for destruction
Of the race of men
Destruction, for destruction
Of the race of men

3. Only The Dead
Only the dead
You open wide and prepare to receive
A hunger sex unseen
You crave hard penetration
And order me to come deep
You'd be all right just to suck me dry
But you can beg and plead...
I only fuck the dead
I only fuck the dead
Only the dead
This ain't no game, it's about life & death
To satisfy you needs
You demand a sensation
And crave my anal feed
You'd be all right with just a "golden rain"
But you can beg and plead...
I only fuck the dead
I only fuck the dead
Only the dead

4. The Longships Are Coming
Lindisfarne, holy land
Of pilgrimage for the christian man
Church of god, and monastery
8th of June, in the year of 793
The longships are coming
The longships are coming
The longships are coming
The longships are coming
Oh lord, hear us pray
Save us from the norsemen's rage
In despair, final grasp
The longships are coming
The longships are coming
The longships are coming
The longships are coming

5. Helljoy
There is no holy land
No better place to dwell
Here is our day of joy
Here and now is our hell
I am my own god
I am my own slave
There is no redeemer
To see me through the day
Helljoy - pressure of the flesh
Helljoy - indulgence 'til death
Helljoy - pressure of the flesh
Helljoy - indulgence 'til death
There is no glorious heaven
But the one you create
Live your life in sin
Live before it's too late
You must take control
Pleasure of the flesh
Cut the moral leash
Indulgence 'til death
Helljoy - pressure of the flesh
Helljoy - indulgence 'til death
Helljoy - pressure of the flesh
Helljoy - indulgence 'til death

6. Insane For Blood
Insane hunger, cold heart beating
Intense bloodlust, pressure increasing
All excited at every reek of death
Stop at nothing, must feed from human flesh
Insane for blood
Insane for blood
The frustration keeps on peaking
Internal torment pain comes creeping
The night's falling must seek another prey
A new source of blood to live another day
Insane for blood
Insane for blood

7. I Bring You Death
Once a friend
With open arms
A moment black
Now dagger sharp sits in my back
Felt the pain
Seeing red
It's all too late
Before my eyes the veil of hate
You took my soul, I'll take your flesh
So filled with rage I bring you death
I bring you death
I bring you death
On you knees
Before me bleed
How's it feel?
To be the one to be deceived
See the life
Now drain away
As you die
Your filthy pleas jusr pass me by
You took my soul, I'll take your flesh
So filled with rage I bring you death
I bring you death
I bring you death

8. Attack!
[Instrumental]

9. CEO
Rich parents and poor hygiene
Born in the 40's to a life of luxury
You sucked all the right cocks well
To get a really nice job your dad can tell
You call home and say you're working late
But there's another thing now that just can't wait...
What a leader the CEO!
His big secret just doesn't show
He pays a girl to get him through
Puts on his diaper and feed him gruel
A big house, the suburban dream you have
A boring ass wife and a daughter crack queen
You drink drive the brand new car
Na djust bribe another cop when you get caught
You whine out loud 'bout the income tax
Because the monthly 5000 Euros never last
What a leader the CEO!
His big secret just doesn't show
He pays a girl to get him through
Puts on his diaper and feed him gruel

10. One Night In Nazareth
Oh, Virgin Mary, maiden of the lord
You are the chosen one, one lucky whore
Don't be afraid now, you've got grace with me
I'll come upon you yeah in just a little less harmony
I'll be your incubus
The angel you can trust
I don't need you to breed
Just swallow all my seed
One night in Nazareth, with the chosen one
So let it be written, so let it be done
I'll be your incubus
The angel you can trust
I don't need you to breed
Just swallow all my seed

11. Praised Be The Lord
Need a better life?
Come to paradise
Live in happiness
Long for Jesus Christ
He can save your soul
Heal your flesh and bone
Any one disease
Welcome to the show!
Praised to be lord
Give us all you can afford
Praised to be lord
Give us all you can afford
Give a contribution
And behold the light
For the second coming
Of holy Jesus Christ
Listen to the preacher
On your knees and pray
Mercy and forgiveness
If you do obey
Praised to be lord
Give us all you can afford
Praised to be lord
Give us all you can afford

12. Metalheads
All right
You metalheads
Get on your feet

Gonna raise hell
Yeah hell's unleashed
Don't need no mortal cure
For our release
Come on bang your heads
Yeah, bang your heads

True metalheads

True metalheads

Gonna crush the souls of those who disbelieve

13. To Miklagård
From Birka the norsemen set sail
Across the wide open Baltic sea
At Lagoda and Novgorod they settled
Slaves and fur they would trade for silver and silk
Forward to Miklagård
Forward to Miklagård
On the Dnjepr, they struggled to pass Aifur
Around Kiev, tribes and folk were gathered
And the new master's name was the infamous Rus!
Two thousand ships that sailed the Black sea...
Forward to Miklagård
Forward to Miklagård

14. Long Live The Beast
Nothing's left from the final war
Feeble race exists no more
Time is up for the rule of man
It's an age swallowed by the sand
Long live the beast
In this final curtain call
Long live the beast
That will outlive us all
Long live the beast
In this final curtain call
Long live the beast
That will outlive us all
All is dead, silence in the air
Smell of death is everywhere
In a lair from ages past
Something's born in this aftermath
Long live the beast
In this final curtain call
Long live the beast
That will outlive us all
Long live the beast
In this final curtain call
Long live the beast
That will outlive us all

You preach your message of moral high
Heaven knows how you must lie
A sound Christian life, how sad
So restrained, but you need it so bad

Mrs. Minister, so prude and upper glass
Mrs. Minister, the night comes
And you're switching fast
Mrs. Minister, becomes the dildo queen
Mrs. Minister, you jam it up
Then suck it clean

Born rich, of high society
Will respected for all to see
Cannot mix with the working man
Oh so proud, but you need it so bad

Mrs. Minister, the night comes
And you're switching fast
Mrs. Minister, becomes the dildo queen
Mrs. Minister, you jam it up
Then suck it clean

6. Joy In The Sun
Wanna go on a date
Gonna have some fun
Pick you up in my new car
Take a ride in the sun
Driving down the boulevard
Headin' down to the beach
Gonna drive real slow now
Grab a hold on me...

(...for some...)
Formaldehyde fun
Joy in the sun
Formaldehyde fun
Joy in the sun

Well then here we go
Rock around the clock
Playin'hide and sick now
She sure knows how to suck
Such a nice little mouth
Drives a man insane
Guess I ain't that dead yet
Taste that smell again...

Joy in the sun
Formaldehyde fun
Joy in the sun

Infernal pure hate
Churning blood, now black
They plot a way from attack

Rejoice
The demon rejoice

8. We'll Come For You
Demons gather slowly around this city of hell
The zombies are dancing in the moonlight
A feast for all you sinners of joy and blasphemy
The evil armies attack to night

We'll come for you
We'll come for you
We'll come for you
Ain't nothing you can do

A morbid angel signs with demented voice
The orchs are pounding the drums of doom and night
Men and ghouls with blackened eyes and faces deranged
The evil armies attack to night

We'll come for you
We'll come for you
We'll come for you
Ain't nothing you can do

10. Dissection Leftovers
Flesh... cat... flesh

I wake up at night so hungry for blood
The taste of a new corpse I feel
Illusions of bodies dismemberment fresh
Dissection leftovers for me
I break into a morgue or a hospital near
My organ erects eagerly
I search for the dishes the surgeon has left
Dissection leftovers for me

Flesh... cat... flesh

I revel in blood and I revel in flesh
There's never enough for my needs
I carve on the limbs and I chew with delight
Dissection leftovers for me

Flesh... cat... flesh

11. Peace, Piece By Piece
I am the one, the man, the myth with a knife
Destined to take your life
I am Mr. Insane
Now let me taste your pain

I'll cut you piece by piece
Oh man I feeled so pleased
Only death can end this show
Peace for my restless soul

I'm the god and I'm here to seal your fate
You'll suffer my evil hate
I am the Mr. Insane
Killing is just a game

I'll cut you piece by piece
Oh man I feeled so pleased
Only death can end this show
Peace for my restless soul

Peace, piece by piece

12. Burnt Alive
Burnt Alive
She was burnt Alive

Before the holy cross
The priest of christ he knelt
Oh help me mighty god
And save me from this hell
She still rejecting me
Oh god why can't she see
Tell me it's your will
To set my seed free

And god said:
In fire... you tie her...
To the stake... you witch
She was burnt alive
She was burnt alive
...burnt alive

Before the holy cross
Again he knelt and grinned
Oh help her mighty god
And save her from this sin
She cares not for my right
To take her when I please
It is the will of god
To set my seed free

And god said:
In fire... you tie her...
To the stake... you witch
She was burnt alive
She was burnt alive
She was burnt alive
She was burnt alive
...burnt alive

13. Your Head Is Mine
Your head is mine
With my choice of wine

I want your body and I want your flesh
I plunge the dagger in oh what a mess
I cannot stand and wait for you to die
Your body drenched in blood I'll eat you dead or alive
I feast on young ones and I feast on the old
I just gut'em up and spice'em then fold...
You are my evening dinner can't you see
I've got this special taste in humans I feed

Your head is mine
With my choice of wine
Your head is mine
With my choice of wine

I want your body and I need your flesh
I plunge the dagger in oh what a mess
I cannot stand and wait for your last cry
Your body drenched in blood I'll eat you dead or alive
I take the young ones and I take'em old
I just gut'em up and spice'em then fold...
You are my evening dinner can't you see
I've got this special taste in humans I feed

Your head is mine
With my choice of wine
Your head is mine
With my choice of wine

7. Hero Of The Land
[Music - Johnny]
[Lyrics - Johnny]

LONG AGO WHEN THE CENTURY WAS YOUNG
LIVED A MAN WHO PASSED HIS LAND ON TO HIS SON
LONG AGO WHEN THE MORAL OF MAN WAS HIGH
LIFE WAS A BATTLE JUST TO SURVIVE
EVERY DAY A STRUGGLE AND A TOIL
TO HARVEST THE LAND AND TO SEED THE SOIL
HE WORKED IN THE FOREST AND HE WORKED IN THE FIELDS
WORKED DAY AND NIGHT TO FEED HIS FAMILY

BEHOLD THE OLD MAN - STRIVING ALL HE CAN
BEHOLD THE OLD MAN - FOR HE IS THE HERO OF THE LAND

HE NEVER CARED MUCH FOR FORTUNE AND FAME
HE NEVER CRIED AND HE NEVER COMPLAINED
HE BUILT HIS DREAM WITH HIS BARE HANDS & MIND
A SIMPLE MAN BUT AN ARTIST OF LIFE
AND STILL TODAY AS I BEHOLD THE OLD MAN
I SEE HIM STRIVING ALL THAT HE CAN
ONE OF THESE DAYS HE'LL PASS HIS LAND ON TO HIS SON
LET HIS SPIRIT GUIDE US WHEN THIS CENTURY IS GONE...

BEHOLD THE OLD MAN - STRIVING ALL HE CAN
BEHOLD THE OLD MAN - FOR HE IS THE HERO OF THE LAND

ONE OF THESE DAYS... I'LL BE THE OLD MAN
AND I'LL WILL  FIGHT FOR MY FAMILY AND LAND

BEHOLD THE OLD MAN - STRIVING ALL HE CAN
BEHOLD THE OLD MAN - THE HERO OF THE LAND

BEHOLD THE OLD MAN - STRIVING ALL HE CAN
BEHOLD THE OLD MAN - FOR HE IS THE HERO OF THE LAND

[Music - Johnny]
[Lyric - Johnny]

BOMBS GO OFF AND SHAKE THE GROUND
RADIATION ALL AROUND
IT DOESN'T SMELL, IT DOESN'T SOUND
ALL SURVIVED OR SO IT SEEMS
ANOTHER NUCLEAR LIFE BEGINS
A CHILD IS BORN WITH TWISTED LIMBS

BORN DERANGED
BORN DERANGED
BORN DERANGED

BORN A MUTANT SO DERANGED
CANNOT SEE IT'S PARENTS FACE
CANCER INSIDE GROWING PAIN
COUGHING BLOOD, THE DAYS GO BY
ORGANS SLOWLY BURN INSIDE
ALIVE DECAYING, HOPE TO DIE

BORN DERANGED
BORN DERANGED
BORN DERANGED

BORN DERANGED
BORN DERANGED
BORN DERANGED

BORN DERANGED OUR PRICE TO PAY
FOR THE EUROPEAN UNION'S AIM -
TO LEAD THE MARKET'S "HALL OF SHAME"
FACE THE FACT: IT'S JUST A PART
OF UNITED STATES OF EUROPE'S START -
THIS LITTLE "GIFT" FROM JACQUES CHIRAC

BORN DERANGED
BORN DERANGED
BORN DERANGED

10. I Hate Returned
[Music - Johnny]

HEAR MY CALL
MY WARRIORS COME WITH ME NOW
HEAR MY CALL
MJOLLNIR SHALL GUIDE US THROUGH THE BATTLE

...I HAVE RETURNED

I HAVE THE POWER
TO CRUSH THE FORCES OF DECADENCE
I HAVE THE POWER
TO TAKE BACK WHAT'S RIGHTFULLY MINE

I AM THE NEW AGE
WHERE NATURE REGAINS IT'S STRENGTH
I AM THE NEW AGE
WHERE MAN IS ABOVE ALL GODS

...I HAVE RETURNED

11. Ragnarök
[Music - Johnny]
[Lyrics -Johnny]

15000 YEARS
THE EXCEPTION OF MANKIND
THE TIME TO LIVE, THE TIME TO DIE
...AGAIN

THE END OF ALL... SOON TO BEGIN
THE COMING OF THE ETERNAL ICE:

RAGNARK... RAGNARK

YEARS OF WARS
MAN AGAINST MAN
LAKES OF BLOOD... FLOW
BURNING HORIZONS
THE SUN IS BLACK...

RAGNARK... RAGNARK

15000 YEARS
THE EXCEPTION OF MANKIND
THE TIME TO LIVE, THE TIME TO DIE...
...AGAIN

12. Your Pain, My Gain
[Music - Anders / Johnny]
[Lyrics - Anders]

YOUR PAIN - MY GAIN

SO MUCH HATRED
TOWARDS MAN
A TRUE PSYCHO
YES I AM
I WILL FEED YOU
WITH FAKE TRUST
BUT YOU'LL MEET MY
MORBID LUST

YOUR PAIN - MY GAIN

NOW I'VE GOT YOU
ON YOUR KNEES
AND I'LL USE YOU
AS I PLEASE
WHEN I KILL YOU
PEACE OF MIND
A LIFE TAKEN
I FEEL FINE

13. The End
[Music - Fredrik]
[Lyrics - Fredrik]

THE WORLD IS OLD AND TIRED
IN MY DREAMS I SEE THE END
NOW I SEE THINGS CLEARER
I WILL NOT BE CONDEMNED

MY MIND REQUIRES
THE VOICES DEMAND
MY MIND REQUIRES
THE VOICES DEMAND
...THE END

THE SUN HAS SOON BURNED OUT
THE SIGNS ARE THERE TO BE SEEN
THE STARS ARE FALLING DOWN
THE ONLY GOD IS ME

MY MIND REQUIRES
THE VOICES DEMAND
MY MIND REQUIRES
THE VOICES DEMAND
...THE END

THE SOULLESS CHILD IS BORN
IN MY DREAMS I SEE THE END
THEY WHISPER IN MY HEAD
THE WORLD WILL BE CONDEMNED

MY MIND REQUIRES
THE VOICES DEMAND
MY MIND REQUIRES
THE VOICES DEMAND
...THE END
...THE END
...THE END

UNLEASHED LYRICS


1. Courage Today, Victory Tomorrow!
At the ends of all things
Behold what nature brings
For what comes on the final day
You must be brave

Oh heed my call!
Courage today, victory tomorrow!
Courage today, victory tomorrow!

The great war of our time
Gods and men side by side
Like in the past as they fell
Some must survive to tell
The old tales without end
The legacy passed on again
In a new time, a new place
We shall live the ancient way

Oh heed my call!
Courage today, victory tomorrow!
Courage today, victory tomorrow!

Oh heed my call!
Courage today, victory tomorrow!
Courage today, victory tomorrow!

...and so it begins...

2. So It Begins
All that was the past
Comes to an end
Survive and evolve
Or die again
The hour of change
So definite in sight
Indiscriminately
The unprepared will die

So it begins
The unprepared will die

It is the dawn of truth
And it dominates
Like a pestilence
With no cure but fate
Rejuvenating death
The seeds of a new time
Induscriminately
The unprepared will die

So it begins
The unprepared will die
So it begins
The unprepared will die

It is the dawn of truth
...as Yggdrasil trembles...

3. As Yggdrasil Trembles
What troubles the earth, wind and sea
What powers will be unleashed
Is the age of mankind soon gone
Are we prepared for what will come
Whatever stirs beyond the dark has no shame
Nothing will ever be the same

Battalions of the world are you ready?
For the lasting cold and the darkness
Battalions of the world are you ready?

What will the future hold
What horrors are yet to unfold
Is this our way to Odin's hall
Are we prepared for the final call
Whatever stirs beyond the dark has no shame
Nothing will ever be the same

Battalions of the world are you ready?
For the lasting cold and the darkness
Battalions of the world are you ready?
As the mighty Yggdrasil trembles
Battalions of the world are you ready?

Our loyalty will be tested
Allegiance to Midgard we have sworn
As the mighty Yggdrasil trembles
We stand to face the new dawn

Battalions of the world are you ready?
For the lasting cold and the darkness
Battalions of the world are you ready?
As the mighty Yggdrasil trembles
Battalions of the world are you ready?
As the mighty Yggdrasil trembles
Battalions of the world are you ready?

4. Wir Kapitulieren Niemals
Wir kapitulieren niemals
(We will never surrender)

Face the fact here we are
You said we'd never come this far
Viking death metal
Viking death metal
We took you all for a ride
As 20 years were passing by
Viking death metal
Viking death metal

Was andere sagen ist uns scheissegal
Wir kapitulieren niemals
(We will never surrender)

Risen from an ancient force
To the hammer we are sworn
Viking death metal
Viking death metal
Listen up and listen fast
We are the future and the past
Viking death metal
Viking death metal

Was andere sagen ist uns scheissegal
Wir kapitulieren niemals
(We will never surrender)

All the world against us
The enemy is great
But this is our life, this is our fate
We drink to Odin, we drink to Thor
With swords drawn onward into war

Was andere sagen ist uns scheissegal
Wir kapitulieren niemals
(We will never surrender)

5. This Time We Fight
So many years
He struggled hard
And stood against the oppression
He saw the fall
Of all his kin
In a dark premonition

As the battle rages
Will this be his day to die?
He holds his hammer toward the sky
This time we fight!

Now is the day
For the justice
So rightfully claimed
He called to arms
Sharpened his axe
And put on his chain
The call to rise
And be strong
As the hour grows near
A blot to Thor
For protection
And against all fear

As the battle rages
Will this be his day to die?
He holds his hammer toward the sky
This time we fight!
He holds his hammer toward the sky
This time we fight!

6. Master Of The Ancient Art
I rule the living
I claim the dead
Bringer of good and evil
As mankind will be led
I tame the winds of time
And decide all fate
The creator of purpose
Teacher of the ways

I am the master - master of the ancient art
I am the master - master of the ancient art

I am the warrior
Of the glory and the might
Tyr armed me with his sword
For the battle of life
I rule the kingdom of beasts
Oppose me and fall
Behold the most vicious animal
Of them all

I am the master - master of the ancient art
I am the master - master of the ancient art

7. Chief Einherjar
In a world of black and white
His colours blazed
A heart that burned like a thousand fires
With the passion to create
Every day a new challenge
Was taken by storm
Not a chance for a dampened spirit
As new ideas were born

I think you know...
You have my sword
Chief Einherjar
You have my sword
Chief Einherjar

All against the odds as trouble came
But no task to great
Gave us courage to stand the ground
Put no trust in fate
A true warrior, yes he was
Right until the end
In the halls of Valhalla
We shall meet again

I think you know...
You have my sword
Chief Einherjar
You have my sword
Chief Einherjar

8. Return Fire
You're think we're easy prey
A battle without losses
So load your guns and aim
Come at us anytime
With everything you've got!
Be the next in line (as we...)
Return fire, return fire...

Your chances will decrease
As Odin chooses side
Attack us and you'll see
We were born to fight
No mercy will be given
Target now in sight
Return fire, return fire...

Battalions lock and load
Guns ready, aim, fire!
Battalions on my command
Guns ready, aim, fire!

We rise against you all
In every town and nation
Until you flee or fall
The warriors of the brave
Now standing firm and strong
Will win or die this day
Return fire, return fire...

Better listen fast
This is our final warning
You cannot hope to last
Against the rapid fire
From one of our battalions
There will be no survival...
Return fire, return fire...

Battalions lock and load
Guns ready, aim, fire!
Battalions on my command
Guns ready, aim, fire!

9. Far Beyond Hell10. Dead To Me
The time is up, the dices are cast
So it came to this at last
The words you spoke were all too grand
No turning back you little man
And since you lack common sense
Suffer now the consequence
Suffer the consequence
Suffer the consequence

What you will experience is far beyond hell
So far beyond hell

A second chance you beg for me
Oh, i have ways to set you free
Your praying death comes without pain
Well killing isn't quite my game
I see now that you understand
For you i have this special pain
Suffer the consequence
Suffer the consequence

What you will experience is far beyond hell
So far beyond hell
What you will experience is far beyond hell
So far beyond hell

10. Dead To Me
Tied up in a moral life, made up like a play
Systematized and tamed
Play a role in every part, never step aside
Too boring and too lame

So you kneel...
And come crawling at my feet
You're dead to me
I'm not the one you seek
You're dead to me

Always living in the past and in lack of words
Searching for a fate
Waiting for the peak of life, it is all a dream
And it's getting much too late
Wake up to another world, all the same but new
The needs you cannot meet
Look around and face the fact, your time is running out
Christ is obsolete

Yet you kneel...
And come crawling at my feet
You're dead to me
I'm not the one you seek
You're dead to me

11. Yahweh And The Chosen Ones
You are a holy people to your god
And god has chosen you, this is your call
For all the earth is mine and you shall be onto me
A kingdom of priests and a holy nation above all

Our king is truth, and nothing else compares
Bow to the holy one
Blessed is he
Now to the holy one
Down on your knees

Praised are you, Lord our God, King of the universe
Who has chosen us out of all the nations on earth
Raised us above all tongues and made us holy
Through his commandments, we are holy from birth

Our king is truth, and nothing else compares
Bow to the holy one
Blessed is he
Now to the holy one
Down on your knees

For god did not make us like the nations of other lands
And did not make us the same as other families of the earth
God did not place us in the same situations as others
And our destiny is not the same as anyone else's

Bow to the holy one
Blessed is he
Now to the holy one
Down on your knees

12. Cannibalistic Epidemic Continues
O taste the goodness
Of our god
And eat his flesh
And drink his blood
Come and partake
In the gospel feast
Be saved from sin
And feel at peace

Cannibalistic epidemic continues
Cannibalistic epidemic continues

Embrace the holy communion!
Eat - this is my body
Drink - this is my blood

Give not that which a holy
To the dogs
Honour me as i die
Don't share me with hogs

Cannibalistic epidemic continues
Cannibalistic epidemic continues

Embrace the holy communion!
Eat - this is my body
Drink - this is my blood

Cannibalistic epidemic continues
Cannibalistic epidemic continues

Embrace the holy communion!
Eat - this is my body
Drink - this is my blood
Eat - this is my body
Drink - this is my blood

UNLEASHED LYRICS


1. The Greatest Of All Lies
Oppressing the poor, mocking the sick
Crusader of virtues, your holy fire lit
Blessed be the ones who will not fight
Against the words of the moral tyrant's might

The empty prayers of absolution that dies
Obedient souls bow to the passion of the Christ

The passion of the Christ
The greatest of all lies
The greatest of all lies

The Christian values a marketing game
Through holy wars and terror in your name
Upon this rock your church has been built
For all mankind, to live in fear and guilt
The empty prayers of absolution that dies
Obedient souls bow to the passion of the Christ

The passion of the Christ
The greatest of all lies
The greatest of all lies

Nailed to the cross, as death sets in
The blood of Christ spilled for all human sins

The great illusion of his final sigh
Obedient souls bow to the passion of the Christ

The passion of the Christ
The greatest of all lies
The greatest of all lies

My God, why hast thou forsaken me?

2. Long Before Winter's Call
Now it came to pass in those days
There went out a decree
From Caesar on his throne
That all the world should be enrolled

So Joseph took Mary to the balls
And from Nazareth they went
To the city of Bethlehem
For registration and taxing, right on then

The bastard child was born
Long before winter's call
The bastard child was born
Long before winter's call

And it came to pass, while they were there
That she was great with child
Lived in a stable 'til it was done
She brought forth her bastard son

And as the shepherds in the field
Were keeping watch over their flocks at night
An angel of the lord
Said unto them a saviour has been born

The bastard child was born
Long before winter's call
The bastard child was born
Long before winter's call

3. Your Children Will Burn
Religious filth, spreading like the plague
Bombs and prayers
The damage you've done, will not be gone
In a thousand years

The world had been a captive
I bring you

Destruction,hatred and terror
You will bleed for me
Destruction,hatred and terror
You children will burn

I laugh at your faith, you are all the same
Maggots of God
Prophets and priests, and their fascist beliefs
Will be torn apart

The world will be mine again

Destruction,hatred and terror
You will bleed for me
Destruction,hatred and terror
You children will burn

4. Hammer Battalion
Onward pounding war machine
The hammer battalion Unleashed
Warheads armed with nuclear hate
Using humans as our bait

The order is to kill
Fire at will
The order is to kill
Fire at will
Hammer battalion Unleashed

Smashing through like rabid hounds
Walls they built fall to the ground
Those who oppose is flee or die
Death is marching on our side

The order is to kill
Fire at will
The order is to kill
Fire at will
Hammer battalion Unleashed

Join the battalion!

5. This Day Belongs To Me
Through mist and shadows dim
Stained with life ever so grim
Timeless travails in the utter dark
In the valleys of death i have walked

Now, is my time!

Odin, set me free
This day belongs to me

Face down in piles of human dirt
Endless pain that doesn't hurt
Torn apart yet physically whole
By the filth of man nothing grows

Now, is my time!
Odin, set me free
This day belongs to me

6. Marching Off To War
Free from their boundaries and chains
We march for revenge again
With our legions prepared by our side
To fight, to live and to die
The hour of truth is here
So we rise to the challenge everywhere
Marching off to war
Join or fall!

Behold as we march off to war
Cities shall burn and fall

Nothing can stop us now
By the hammer of Thor they shall bow
For the masters of art have returned
Our enemies' flag will be burned

The hour of truth is here
So we rise to the challenge everywhere
Marching off to war
Join or fall!

Behold as we march off to war
Cities shall burn and fail

7. Entering The Hall Of The Slain
Burning illness deep within
Demons haunt my every breath
All the years in agony
Staring into the eyes of death
....into the eyes of death
The time that was given to me
Alone with the thoughts some would dread
Staring into the eyes of death

Entering the hall of the slain
Entering the hall of the slain

I fear no God
I fear no pain
As my time has come
Entering the hall of the slain

Leave it all behind me now
Soil, wind and fire
No regrets as i bid farewell
Valkyries, come take me higher!
....come take me higher
The hour has struck for me
At the end of my conscious desire
So come, come take me higher....

Entering the hall of the slain
Entering the hall of the slain

I fear no God
I fear no pain
As my time has come
Entering the hall of the slain

Open wide the gates of Valhalla!

8. Black Horizon
Towards a black horizon
Our brothers are avenged, the battle is won
The longships set sail in the night
On the raging sea, with the stars as guide

Thoughts of those we could not sail,
The wounds i received and blows i gave
The darkness before my eyes
The freezing wind that chills my spine

Black Horizon....
Towards the black horizon

The waves that clashes to the side
The hunger and pain i must survive
Still i can feel the smell
Of my enemies blood and hear their cries for help
A glance from an axe blade shines
As memory of those i slayed this time
Long is our voyage at sea
To Birka shores, to the land of the free

Black Horizon....
Towards the black horizon

Thor, give me the strength
Like so many times before
Thor, give me the power
To bring us home to Birka shores
I raise my hammer in honour
Of those who'll never come home
I swear an oath to their fathers
I carve their names in stone

Black Horizon....
Towards the black horizon
Black Horizon....
Towards the black horizon

9. Carved In Stone
Gone, is the black horizon
But not the images of passed time
Dead are the many brave warriors
Who fought by my side
Who fought by my side

Now as i carve the names in stone
Of those who dies so far from home
I mean for these words to bring them pride
As time will pass, their deeds will never die

Accept this gift of eternal remembrance
For the courageous and bold
Thor, give these runes your blessing
As time will unfold
As time will unfold

Now as i carve the names in stone
Of those who dies so far from home
I mean for these words to bring them pride
As time will pass their deeds will never die....

10. Warriors Of Midgard
Politicians and employers
Lack of needed future knowledge
Protectionism is what they grow
Scared to death by the things we know

Never fall into their trap
Never buy their empty crap
Their institutions will fail
Our way of life prevail

The new breed that won't be led
Warriors of Midgard
we define the road ahead
Warriors of Midgard

Society of imitation
No place of innovation
Vassals of conformity
Want to end individuality
It's a zombie's dance all the way
And become just another prey
Their institutions will fail
Our way of life prevail

The new breed that won't be led
Warriors of Midgard
we define the road ahead
Warriors of Midgard
The new breed that won't be led
Warriors of Midgard

11. Midsummer Solstice
Nature stands erected
The season of the Sun
Gather around the stones
The time for blot has come

Light the fires of the north
Bring forth the goblets
A toast to our fortune
To Freya, Frey and fortune

Come lust for ecstasy
Unleash the seal of man
Come lust for ecstasy
It is Midsummer's Eve

Morbid spirits rising
Essence of the night
They sing a song of blasphemy
The demons dance tonight

Light the fires of the north
Bring forth the goblets
A toast to our fortune
To Freya, Frey and fortune

Come lust for ecstasy
Unleash the seal of man
Come lust for ecstasy
It is Midsummer's Eve

12. Home Of The Brave
As Gungir has beed thrown
Over the battle field
Brynhilde chooses her price
Among those with sword and shield

Home of the brave
Home of the brave
Where Odin awaits
Preparing for the final day

In the blood of every warrior
In the heart of honest men
In the souls of those who are dying
There is comfort at the end

Home of the brave
Home of the brave
Where Odin awaits
Preparing for the final day

....home of the brave

Welcome to Valhalla!

13. I Want You Dead
Common man you make me sick with hate
Nothing about you is real
Talk in circles to avoid the truth
All the things you must conceal
Prove your point just once and I'll give in
All the crap you need to say
Point your finger at us, brave like few
Standing safely miles away

I want you dead
I want you dead

Sacred son of yet an ugly bitch
Comprehension ain't your game
Christian looks - it is the look of your face
Lack of knowledge is your name
As i vomit in your general direction
Tears are falling as you flee
Walk the roads without a spark
I'll help you die as charity

I want you dead
I want you dead
So fucking dead

1. A New Day Will Rise
In the far distance
Under an unknown flag
A vast army appears
Will the great war end at last?
Overwhelming power
Hammer battalions on retreat
Overwhelming power
White Christ now flee

Our time will come
A new day will rise

Our time will come
A new day will rise
Our time will come
A new day will rise

Thousands of soldiers
Lying dead in the fields
Fires across the plains
Again the Folklands bleed
We await the return
Of the avanger of Odalheim
Our time will come
A new day will rise

Our time will come
A new day will rise

Our time will come
A new day will rise
Our time will come
A new day will rise
Our time will come
So stand proud...
A new day will rise

(Have faith my warriors
And stand strong, for a new day will rise)

Our time will come
A new day will rise
Our time will come
So stand proud...
A new day will rise

2. They Came To Die
In this cold aftermath
Where the blood has dried at last
Soldiers lay scattered around
In the fields of death, a fading sound

They came to die
They came to die
They came to die

A shameful march without a sound
With weapons pointed at the ground
They came out of the mist
So it all came down to this
Now approaching our lines
Heavens cry, their souls have died
Christ is dead or so it seems
Death before loyalty

They came to die
They came to die
They came to die

In nomine Patris et Filii et Spiritus Sancti
Death before loyalty

They came to die
They came to die
They came to die

In nomine Patris et Filii et Spiritus
They came to die

3. Defenders Of Midgard
Through the dark, dark caves
That was once built
By our fathers determination
Strength and will

But we will rise again
And fight, fight to defend
Our Midgard 'til the very end
Fight to defend
Our Midgard 'til the very end

A time to heal and prepare
For tomorrow
As we march with our minds
Black with sorrow

But we will rise again
And fight, fight to defend
Our Midgard 'til the very end
Fight to defend
Our Midgard 'til the very end

Through the dark, dark caves
That was once built
By our fathers determination
Strength and will

But we will rise again
And fight, fight to defend
Our Midgard 'til the very end
Fight to defend
Our Midgard 'til the very end

Fight to defend
Our Midgard 'til the very end
Fight to defend
Our Midgard 'til the very end

4. Where Is Your God Now?
Here we are alive again
In a battle without end
So we rise from the caves
And march until sol descends

Here we are. Who could tell?
We will all be unleashed from Hel
We will have our revenge
On the soil where our fathers fell

Where is your god now? [4x]

Here we are, but he is gone
The search is on for the sacred one
Hiding out, a cowards game
White Christ in on the run

Here we are. Come out and play
Take his place, die in vain
Or send him out and he shall meet
The bolt thrower on the open plain

Where is your god now? [4x]

Behold the crucifix.
What does it symbolize?
Pallid incompetence
Hanging on a tree

Here we are alive again
In a battle without end
So we rise from the caves
And march until sol descends

Here we are. Who could tell?
We will all be unleashed from Hel
We will have our revenge
On the soil where our fathers fell

Where is your god now? [4x]

5. The Bolt Thrower
He was born of the northern wind
With a spirit of steel, destined to win
A master of war
A master of war that feels no pain
That feels no pain

Forged in the fires of Muspelheim
His will stood the test of time
A master of war that feels no pain
His loyals calling out his name...

The Bolt Thrower
The Bolt Thrower

A master of war
A master of war that feels no pain
That feels no pain

Long was our wait this night
As he called out White Christ to flight
Their time is up, no more hiding in shame
His loyals calling out his name...

The Bolt Thrower
The Bolt Thrower

He was born of the northern wind
With a spirit of steel, destined to win
A master of war that feels no pain
His loyals calling out his name...

The Bolt Thrower
The Bolt Thrower

6. Let The Hammer Fly
Onward into battle now
Fearless rage, gun them down
Some will fight, some will flee
Shoot them dead, watch them bleed

Thor rides his chariot
Rides across the sky
Let the Hammer fly

Kill them all
Leave none alive
Kill them all
Let the Hammer fly

Headless bodies on their knees
Upright as their torsos freeze
Falling down onto the snow
By the firing squads' massive blow
Vengeance now taken for their deeds
In the battle at Uppsala fields
God is still nowhere to be found
Did he flee to higher ground?

Thor rides his chariot
Rides across the sky
Let the Hammer fly

Kill them all
Leave none alive
Kill them all
Let the Hammer fly

Let the Hammer fly, let... the Hammer... fly

(Tyr draws his sword
The Spear of Odin is thrown
Thor rides his chariot
Hel will take her share)

Let the Hammer fly
Kill them all
Leave none alive
Kill them all
Let the Hammer fly

7. Where Churches Once Burned
The battle is over and we march again
Across the northern lands so grand
We take back all that once was given to us
Village by village, land by land
The cross of terror shall be set on fire
And burn like so many times before
Where churches once burned by our fathers' Vengeance
Again, behold the rule of Thor!
...behold the rule of Thor

Where churches once burned
Now behold the rule of Thor!

Ans so we're chasing White Christ off our lands
And burn their churches to the ground
We take back all that once was given to us
And reinstate the Hammer Now!
...reinstate the Hammer now

Where churches once burned
Now behold the rule of Thor!
Where churches once burned
Now behold the rule of Thor!

[Chorus]

8. Land Of The Thousand Lakes
Behind us churches burn to ashes
The quest continues across the Baltic sea
(The Gulf of Bothnia)
To the land of the thousand lakes
Where the forest gives us time to rest and breathe

In a warrior's mind
His father's words from another time

Ride out my son
Ride forth tonight
Warriors so proud
Will fight by your side

We reached the clan of the wilderness
Our forces join in a blot for the dead
Together in the endless war
We speak of the past and what lies ahead

In a warrior's mind
His father's words from another time
Ride out my son
Ride forth tonight
Warriors so proud
Will fight by your side

And defend the helpless ones
So hold your head up high
Stand strong for your kin
And face the world with the nine...

In a warrior's mind
His father's words from another time

Ride out my son
Ride forth tonight
Warriors so proud
Will fight by your side

9. Dawn Of The Nine
Dawn of the nine
Dawn of the nine

I am the fire - The burning hatred towards the unjust (Muspelheim)
I am the light - Driven by passion and lust (Alfheim)
I am life - Nature is my only guide (Vanaheim)
Defender of Midgard, sworn to the nine

Dawn of the nine
Dawn of the nine

I am god - I am my own master and slave (Godheim)
I am the warrior - Courage in my name (Mannheim)
I am the giant - I will crush your world of lice (Jotunheim)
Defender of Midgard, sworn to the nine

Dawn of the nine
Dawn of the nine

I am good and evil - Betray me and you will see (Svartalfheim)
I am death - To all that oppose me (Helheim)
I Am the shadow - The chill down your spine (Nifelheim)
Defender of Midgard, sworn to the nine

Dawn of the nine
Dawn of the nine
Dawn of the nine
Dawn of the nine
Dawn of the nine

10. Welcome The Son Of Thor!
Our ships return to the shores of our Folklands
The sky is blue, a northern wind, it's a day so grand

He has returned!
He has returned!

Welcome the son of Thor!
The new age is born
Welcome the son of Thor!
The new age is born

Warriors standing proud, with raised fists, yelling hails
This is your day of truth, reckoning and prevail
Freedom from fascist Christ, his holiness is forever banned
Hope has now finally come to these forsaken lands

He has returned!
He has returned!

Welcome the son of Thor!
The new age is born
Welcome the son of Thor!
The new age is born

Our time has come
A new day has risen
Our time is now

Welcome the son of Thor!
The new age is born
Welcome the son of Thor!
The new age is born
Welcome the son of Thor!
The new age is born

UNLEASHED LYRICS


1. Fimbulwinter
In a time not far from ours
The lasting cold will prevail
The utter darkness will cover all
Nothing will ever be the same
The great ice will lose its grip
Its water will flood the earth
Like an ever flowing stream
Death and rebirth

The Fimbulwinter
The Fimbulwinter
The Fimbulwinter
Come Ragnarök...

Continent by continent
The black storms invade
And destroy everything
That comes in its way

Mother Nature takes back
What's rightfully hers
Ragnarök the liberator
Death and rebirth

The Fimbulwinter
The Fimbulwinter
The Fimbulwinter
Come Ragnarök...

Three years of lasting cold
Three years of darkness

[Repeat chorus]

2. Odalheim
From the ashes of the old world
A new one begin to take form
At the end of the great winter
The new age was born

Black is the dawn
As the new world appears
The air is all silent
We are still here

Rise Odalheim
Rise Odalheim

The winds of the aftermath
Sweeping the shores
Of our ancestor's land
Where we shall build once more

Rise Odalheim
Rise Odalheim

We are the warriors of Midgard
A kindred of mental bloodline
Hammer Battalions of the world
Stand up! This is our time!

Rise Odalheim
Rise Odalheim

Rise Odalheim
Rise Odalheim

We are the warriors of Midgard
A kindred of mental bloodline
Hammer Battalions of the world
Stand up! This is our time!

Rise Odalheim
Rise Odalheim

As the new dawn is rising
The age of the warrior is here
Raise your hammers high
For Odalheim everywhere

3. White Christ
Rape, pillage, burn
As White Christ returns
Women scream in pain
Gutting children is a game

I have seen it before

I see the death
All that is left
Is their blood of lies
And the terror of White Christ

Death is slow
Burned eye sockets glow
With the light of Christ
Shining, oh so bright
Sawed-off limbs fouund
Scattered on the ground
Bodies without heads
Cut off as they fled

I have seen it before

I see the death
All that is left
Is their blood of lies
And the terror of White Christ
The blood of lies
The terror of White Christ

Rulers of the earth
Their message will be heard
Kneel to the cross
All will be lost
Rape, pillage, burn
As White Christ returns
Women scream in pain
Gutting children is a game

I see the death
All that is left
Is their blood of lies
And the terror of White Christ

4. The Hour Of Defeat
Healing the wounds
From the attack
Rest assured they'll be back
Time to prepare
And bury the sorrow
Our retaliation must follow

The hour to defeat, the hour to defeat
Blasting, bursting, will this be our time to retreat?
Blastint, bursting, the hour to defeat

Arming the forces
Now ready to fight
Odin, guide us tonight!
Grand is the view
Of our ships of war
Closing in at enemy shores
Sounding the charge
Fire at will!
The enemy standing still...

All against the odds
Their guns are too great
Outnumbered it is all to late

The hour to defeat, the hour to defeat
Blasting, bursting, the time has come for retreat
Blasting, bursting, the hour to defeat

[Repeat chorus]

5. Gathering The Battalions
Fled the guns blasting death
Through forest, field and sea
Decimated to extinction
The last of our kin yet free

Through a darkened land, once so proud and grand
Gathering the battailons, gathering the battailons

Terror now rule the lands
Where free men one walked
The ALthing council now decides to gather
The battailons of the world to a final war
On the ancient rrails of Norrland
We start journey to be free
Struggling through the Norwegian forest
Raching the coast finally

Through a darkened land, once so proud and grand
Gathering the battailons, gathering the battailons

[Repeat chorus]

6. Vinland
Left the coast of Norway behind
With the vengeance burning in our minds
All determined to return one day
As Soll will shine

Across the open sea, to Vinland and test our steel
Longships towards a black horizon
Like our fathers in the past
We shall have our victory at last

Rubble, chaos, death and decay
Through dead cities on our way
From the east coast to the west
Our forces grow by the day

Across the open sea, to Vinland and test our steel
Longships towards a black horizon
Like our fathers in the past
We shall have our victory at last

[Repeat verse 1 and chorus]

Fearless with swords drawn into battle
Like our fathers in the past
We shall have our victory at last

7. Rise Of The Maya Warriors
Over the mountains we travelled far
Over the sierra madre occidental

We have come to join
The rise of the maya warriors
The rise of the maya warriors

Join the rebellion and the ancient rites
Central america arise
The force of nature will win
Let the drums of war begin

We have come to join
The rise of the maya warriors
The rise of the maya warriors

We have come to join
The rise of the maya warriors
El ascenco de los guerreros mayas
El ascenco de los guerreros mayas

8. By Celtic And British Shores
We shall fight on the seas
We shall fight on the beaches
Disembark and make them flee
We shall never surrender

Rule battailons, battailons rule the waves
Midgard Warriors never will be slaves

We shall fight in the fields
We shall fight in the jills
Marching fast in firm belief
We shall take back what's ours
We shall fight to the last man
We shall fight in the streets
Hunting White Christ off our land
We shall never surrender

Rule battailons, battailons rule the waves
Midgard Warriors never will be slaves

Hammers of Thor held high
We stand victorious, watching our enemies die

[Repeat chorus 2x]

9. The Soil Of Our Fathers
Onward through the land of Gaul
Over the Pyrenees
Warriors are joining our quest
From the desolate cities

We shall struggle and toil
We shall fight again on our father's soil

March my warriors, march!
To reclaim our land
Fight proud my armies, fight!
On our way to the final stand

Gather with the Iberian battailons
Crossing the Ebro river again
Each day our numbers grow
Odin guide us to the very end
Marching to the Roman kingdom
Where the thirteenth legion rule supreme
Our forces now band together
And march against the tyranny

We shall struggle and toil
We shall fight again on our father's soil

March my warriors, march!
To reclaim our land
Fight proud my armies, fight!
On our way to the final stand

[Repeat chorus]

...the final stand

10. Germania
We march across the land
Over the mountains grand
And forests of fire
The black winds of death that sweeps
Through the empty cities
And deserted barbed wire
In this forsaken land
Once ruled by the pagan man
This is the hour!
Here where no life dwells
Where our fathers fell
We'll taje back what is ours

Through Saxon land
For the pagan man
Germania, Germania

Rebuild the Irminsul
Behold the Saxon rule
With reborn glory
Onward through heathen lands
For the pagan man
This is our glory
We shall build again
A kingdom without end
The old rule dying
Our future lies beyond
In history to come
Our dawn is rising

Through Saxon land
For the pagan man
Germania, Germania

[Repeat chorus]

11. The Great Battle Of Odalheim
Our journey has come to an end
The svithiod we have returned 
As Sol descends
On the winter solstice night
Our forces now prepare
For the final fight
A blot to Thor and Odin
As the morning breaks
The battle begins
The battailons of the world
At Uppsala fields
Their call is heard...

This is our world now!!!

The great battle of Odalheim
The great battle of Odalheim

The armies of White Christ
Now fire upon us all
Blitzkrieg light the sky
Warheads that explode

Shreds that burn their way
Into flesh and bone
Men cut in half
Blood rains from the sky
Breaking through enemy lines
Now close to victory
In the great war of our time

The great battle of Odalheim
The great battle of Odalheim

The armies of White Christ
No mercy behind enemy lines 
So close to victory
In the great war of our time

The great battle of Odalheim
The great battle of Odalheim

In the far distance 
Under an unkown flag
A vast army appears...

UNLEASHED LYRICS


1. Beyond The Dark Sun
... For years I have traveled in coldness,
But my heart is warm as the darkened sun above me...
Nothing can never take away
What I've seen with these tired eyes

Face of the weeping night
And the shade of the fading light

The dawn will never rise again for my eyes
And I will never sleep again
I've lost my hope time after time
Cause the light has erased from the sky

Now when the darkness has become part of me
I got to let my shadows free
Cause I never looked behind, I never tried to find
Something that could have made me one
Now when the sorrow has taken control of me
I got to let my shadows free
Cause I never looked behind, I never tried to find
Something that could have made me one
Something that I could reach the Sun

2. Winter Madness
Divine creations now destroyed to uncover the haunted atmosphere
Strange visions of the ancient spirits, travesty of man appears
Coldness and the storming winds lurking for prey
The forces of the Winter reign in dreadful way, there's no escape

I'm following the mistress of night
Through the gates of snow we'll fly
We'll fly

Winter - The realm of eternal ice
Snowfall and darkness descends upon the vales of time
Distant caress of the sun's fading light
The lands were painted white with the Winter's might

My hands are frozen, my mind is at the edge of madness
Oh how many nights and days, I've been lost in this land of sadness

From the primitive thoughts, under the glimmering snow
And burning stones - they'll rise -
The artful spirit: "You don't have to die,
You can rule in afterlife, just concede your soul to me,
(your life is cheap) - no price -"

3. Sleeping Stars
Oh sleeping stars, why are you so sad tonight
Oh sleeping stars, will you shine for me tonight
Oh sleeping stars

Can you see them float in the night sky
Can you hear those echoes of their sweet cries, creating a tune
Can you see them shine so bright
Can you feel their loneliness through their cold light, touching you

My eyes feel so heavy when the stars are calling me
- Join with us eternally -
I'm falling in deep trance and my powers are weakening
I'm falling in a world between dreams and reality

I am now alone in the silent light
And there's nothing but darkness around me
Deeper into unknown the strange light is guiding me
Wake me until it's too late

Suddenly I feel a warmth go through my body
But I feel that a part of me has died, I sense the change in me
I must have been away so long
So please stay with me for a while

4. Battle Against Time
... I'm sailing away to undiscovered seas...

I see a golden light shining far away
I can't tell if I'll make it there someday
I reach my hands but there's no one on my path
I can't sleep 'cause my body is burning
Cold sweat, cannot breath, I'm loosing my mind
Reflection in the mirror shows a different man at night
And as hours and seconds pass by
I feel my every feeling wither and die
Do I really feel this pain
'cause sometimes I can't tell if I'm awake

Watching to the night, the hope is gone
Carrying so much burden in my heart
Watching to the night with tired eyes
Waiting for nothing all my life

Battle against time
I... battle against time

I am covered with cold ice, I am flying in the black skies
Fighting everyday, but it feels like, it's just the same
Oh time... you cut my heart and soul
You carve my will and passion of life
'cause the days of emptiness are piercing through me like arrows

I feel nothing, but hate and love
So much fire inside, so much left undone
Hate&Love

... I'm sailing away and nothing will ever be the same...

5. Death And The Healing
A windstorm dropped a bird from the sky
It fell to the ground and it's wings broke and died
But when the time got by, back to sky it flied
'cause the wings healed in time and the bird was I

Time is the death and the healing
Take your last breath, 'cause death is deceiving
Time is the past, now and tomorrow
Days fly so fast and it leaves me so hollow

A snowstorm blew inside a wolf's eyes
And the frozen tears covered all the mountainsides
But then the time got by and the wolf died
And someday that wolf would be I

6. Starchild
[Part I (Wanderer of Time)]

So mysterious is your world,
Concealed beyond the stars
Far away from the earth,
It flows one with time and dark as the night
Million shapes and colours
Are storming inside your mind
Creating endless dimensions
Forming universes without walls

Let go! of the stars, the stars that fell into the sea
Let go! of your thoughts and dreams,
What can you see now

You cannot save them anymore
- Wanderer of time -
It's too late now
- Creator of Dimensions -
Destroy the walls of time
Hands of the blind are holding your fate
Tides of life will take you away, will take you away

Starchild!
Visions are born from the unknown force
It dominates the way of time
The dream only ends, when the worlds come to an end
Starchild!
You cannot escape to the dark streams of the sea,
To suppress your dreams
Nothing can keep you away from the need to create
'cause your path is free...

[Part II (Burning Star)]

I've hold the fire within myself
Years I've walked in the coldest winds
Through the deserts of sand and snow
The time is passing and I know;
That I'm wasting my life, destroying my dreams
I'm diving into the bottomless sea
From sorrow and pain I find my strength
The more pain I feel, the more I see
Now I'm watching my life flowing in the dark
Like streams of fear running through my heart
And it's wearing me down until I'm gone
Soon I'll join the endless whirls of stars
And I fall (something is dying, yet something is born)
deeper into the unknown voids
And I fall (when will I find my silent dawn)
into infinity like a burning star
I fall like a burning star!

[Part III (The Creation)]

The curtains of mist are fading
And the veils of star clouds are revealed
Storms of new energy
Flows in the depths of my mind
New constellations are born
In total harmony of perfection
And the dissonant unbalance was broken
As the colours fell straight from the light

[Part IV (The Sea of Stars)]

I'm floating in the sea of stars,
I'm drifting away from the shore
I will be lost in the dream when the dark days come
But I will make the time run backwards and
I'll make the stars shine again
I will light up the sky to a bright crimson nights
... And they'll shine together forever
With brilliant silver colours they'll shine forever

[Part V (Finale)]

The whirls of stars takes you now far away
Away from the cold nightmare
Let go of you thoughts and dreams
And you will feel the warmth once again
Starchild! in the Sea of Stars you fall
You fall like a burning star!
Starchild! in the Sea of Stars you fall
... But there is no end to creation

7. Beautiful Death
My face turned pale before the cold eyes of death
My body was frozen by the stare from the dark
I don't want to think of anything but this storm of thoughts in my head
I wasn't prepared for this, 'cause I'm not ready to die
Nothing could have prepared me for this
[backwards:] Only way out is through window of dreams

Nothing but blood so red and deceased
Nothing but pain, I fall on my knees
Tormenting demons, I suffer and bleed
Only way out is through window of dreams

The rain whips the lonely and crushed soul
The dark clouds are closing fast, the wind is blowing the colours of life away
The growing shadow will darken my dreams, and with the fire inside me it feeds
I'll be screaming in the stars when it's over
Storms are raging on the path to home, once so silent and calm
The desperate glare of the dark light is cast on the fallen one
And when the illusions sigh no more, the journey to new dream will carry on
'Cause life is just a beautiful death

Life turns a new and strange page
They will try to take everything away from me
You'll never know the future
Save me from the rain
Tell me what matters in life, if anything
I'm struggling with sickness
They will try to take everything away from me
Are you trying to hide from the end
Save me from the rain
Save me from the end

'Cause life will always be withering away from us
I want to be alone with you
And I'll give my heart to you, before I go
'Cause life is just a beautiful, beautiful death

8. Sadness And Hate
Sad night, the weeper of starwind sky
Take me where the shimmering lights are fading out
Through the shadows of hate and through the fires of grace
I followed the voice in the night, beautiful as black sky,
But nothing I found

My thoughts are captured by the magical chants
Of the spirits, but I cannot see them with these dead eyes
Lost I am in these dismal streams
Lost I am forever in my life

The snow is falling on the withering leaves, I am left in the cold
The shadows are crying in the moonlight
Is this night the last of my life

Have we arrived from our journey, I must ask you now
At last I can cry, 'cause these sad words are calling me tonight
My eyes bleed for you my star, my pride and the love of my heart
But why did you had to fly so far, I raged and it tore me apart
I promise to you with sadness and hate
Wherever I might go, you will know...

I give my life to the withering leaves
To the bleeding moonlight
To the crying shadows
I GIVE MY LIFE TO YOU

WINTERSUN LYRICS


1. When Time Fades Away
[Instrumental]
2. Sons Of Winter And Stars
[I Rain Of Stars]

Behold the rain of stars - The awakening of darkened skies
Falling from the dark - The symphony of dying lights
Behold the rain of stars - The blazing fire came pouring down
Falling from the dark - And life and death became unbound
Sons of winter and stars - Rise!
Sons of winter and stars - Rise!
Sons of winter and stars! Rise! Rise!
Fly with us through the darkness
Sons of winter and stars! Rise! Rise!
And we shall embrace the stars
And we shall open the doors of time

[II Surrounded By Darkness]

I have awaken the darkness
Taste the fear! Taste the pain!
I am the one who seeks vengeance
Into the darkness we fly
Into the shadows they hide
Into the darkness we fly
They will never survive, they ́ll die
Oh they will die!
I sacrifice everything, just for one moment
I throw away everything that matters to me the most
I ́m flying through the darkness
The fire casts a shadow on me
I tear a part of my heart for creation of dimensions
And we fly beyond the restless shadows
We fly beyond the stars
We fly beyond the birth of the worlds
So old I ́ve become - Thousand years staring into emptiness
But now I realize - That it was just an illusion
All this time I thought it was you that would save the sun
Oh rain comes and washes the hate away
Now I am at the crossroads with questions
Somewhere, someday I will find what I am here for
Who am I

[III Journey Inside A Dream]

I ́m wondering now where will you take me
From the horizon the light comes alive
Into the mountains high we set our way
Will we find our way in this long winter night
I see the land of fading sun and rising mountains
And I finally feel that I ́ve found my home
But oh, how it feels so cold when my dreams wither in fragments of time
Revealing that this land will die
Before the winds so cold
The world was shattered in the fragments of time
Before the autumn rains
The coldness will again awake
Falling snow, so soft and cold
Dying moon cast down so weak
Frozen lake, the dancing spirits
Calling me to join in the cosmic dream
The silence is tempting me now...

[IV Sons Of Winter And Stars]

We are the Sons of Winter and Stars
We ́ve come from a far beyond time
Forever the fire burns in our hearts
Our world shall never die
In the arms of the wind we ride till dawn
As the waves of the ocean grind so strong
We wander in the stars until we ́re gone
Our fate is sealed by eternal sun
Until we fade away - Fate will find it ́s way
Until we drift into the dark
It ́s not too late to find a way - Fate will find it ́s way
And fly in cold embrace of stars
Mysteries of time
Unfolding in cosmic dreams
Leaving life and death meaningless
Before the revelation of infinity
Embrace the stars!
The energy flows in me like a river of stars
I ́m surrounded by the circle of fire, but eternal ice has frozen my heart
I ́m lost in the pathways of time
But now the time has come for us!
We are the Sons of Winter and Stars!

3. Land Of Snow And Sorrow
Far away there ́s a land of snow and sorrow

Time has made the frozen tears fall like rain from the starlit sky
And I feel so cold, I can ́t make it tomorrow
Oh, but the night will see where this path will lead my life
Endless field of snow at the edge of the world and the wailing
Winds so cold scar my face, I ́m going insane
I am lost from the light - And the memories follow me in the night
I ́m left in the arms of winter and I am carried far away - Far away
Night is falling over my home
The land of snow and sorrow, oh carry me away from the cold
And I fall asleep, I will dream the last dream
All I was, is gone now and sorrow is all I feel
And the white snow is falling from the starlit sky
And the stars are shining like your eyes
You are so beautiful
And I will follow them in this cold winter night
So I ́d find my way to you this time
Drifting away from the warmth of the darkness
Caressed by the light of a million stars
The darkness will always be a part of my heart
Until I ́m carried away by the winter ́s arms
Night is falling over my home
The land of snow and sorrow, oh carry me away from the cold
And I fall asleep and I will not be afraid
All I was, is gone now and sorrow is all I feel

4. Darkness And Frost
[Instrumental]
5. Time
Darkness and frost are starting to reach
The heart of this land with a cold disease
Sleep now for a while before the storm awakes
And one day it will reward you for the burden of wait
The roots go deep into the frozen dead ground
Listen to the land of snow, it makes no sound
For ages searching the warmth of the sun
If it never finds me, I can die as one
Time will go on and we are drifting away in the night
I ́ve been searching so long, but I will find you even if it takes my whole life
But tonight I feel so alone and I know that you are forever gone
Oh time, don ́t fade away when I need you here, oh please don ́t leave me now
TIME!
Time! Fades away!
When time fades away!
And I ́ll never be the same
Time! Time! Time! Time!
You want so much from me - I feel nothing but grief and despair
How can I make you feel again - All my dreams are just visions I can ́t bear
You want something that I can ́t give - I cannot keep living in this bitter dream
And I don ́t care anymore
It feels like my life is ending
Oh, another year gone by
But nothing has changed in my life
And time goes on forever and ever
And it waits for no one
Time fades away
And I fade away
And I ́ll never be the same
TIME! Fades away!
When time fades away!
And I ́ll never feel the same
And I fade away!
When time fades away!
And I ́ll never feel the same

WINTERSUN LYRICS


1. Awaken From The Dark Slumber (Spring)
[Part I The Dark Slumber]

Beneath the murky soil
The draw of the ancient spell
Swallowing everything in the ground
And then there was no sound

Twisting the roots of life
Distorting the obscure shapes
The day was creeping into night
And then there was no light

The mist was rolling from the mountains
Creatures were crawling under the ground
The darkness fell from the sky
And then there was no life

The spell was too strong
Too weak to resist its pull
The wind was frozen still as I took my last breath
But then there was no death

The days turned into years
The years turned into eternity
The natural order was twisted into dark harmony
Dark dark harmony

I created my own fears
The mist of sorrow encircled my thoughts
The demons came forth from the shadows bringing dark disease
Dark dark disease

With a sudden roar the ground trembled and cried
As the fire burned a hole in the sky
The light was swallowed into the ground and the colors were broken in the night
And all the stars' creations were left to die

Now! Let the dark disease wipe out all the living
Oh! And let all the lands be filled with silence
In the night´s cold embrace you left me astray
And the hope of new life fades away
Now! Let all the lands be covered in black snow
Will the morning sun ever rise again
And let all the creatures of the forest turn into stone
The slow demise has begun
Will this be forever

[Part II The Awakening]

From the realms below we ride
And in terror they run and hide
From the shadows of old we rise
Awaken from the dark - from the dark slumber

Over the ancient ruins we fly
Where the old kings go to die
And new kingdoms rising high
Awaken from the dark dark slumber

Awaken from the dark - from the dark slumber
Awaken from the dark dark slumber

Rise!

Creatures of the dawn
Crawling from the depths of the frozen earth
As the shadows were twisting and turning beneath the sun

The sound of the moaning beasts
Blaring through the forest
As they´re roaming wild beneath the morning sun

Ride! Ride with us again!
Fight! And live as free men!
Die! And be born again!

Ride! Ride!
Ride with us again!
Fight! Fight!
And live as free men!
Die! Die!
And be born again!

Die and be born again!

Centuries in darkness
Bound to ruthless ice and snow
As the dawn of the new world rises, we shall be free

By the fire we live and die
And the light of the sun fills our eyes
From the fire beyond the ancient stars we are born

From the realms below we ride
And in terror they run and hide
From the shadows of old we rise
Awaken from the dark - from the dark slumber

Over the ancient ruins we fly
Where the old kings go to die
And new kingdoms rising high
Awaken from the dark dark slumber

Awaken from the dark - from the dark slumber

As the old worlds fall behind
Our spirit reaches wide
With no fear breathing new life
Awaken from the dark dark slumber

2. The Forest That Weeps (Summer)
I am the mist in the morning
I am the moss in the ground
You are the light that cuts through the stone

I am the worms in the dirt
I am the branches reaching the sky
You are the source, the orchestrator of life

In the dark rain the grey mountains sing
A sad song of winter and the howling wind
Visions of the past in the haunting dreams
Under the dead sky, under the withered trees

The night falls upon the forest that weeps
Father of shadows that forever sleeps

I saw the lakes that shimmer
I heard the clanging of the wild rivers
You are the voice that carries throughout the land

I felt the strength of my ancestors
As I walked through the land of the dead
You are the fire that burns forever

In the dark rain the grey mountains sing
A sad song of winter and the howling wind
Visions of the past in the haunting dreams
Under the dead sky, under the withered trees

The night falls upon the forest that weeps
Father of shadows that forever sleeps

In the dark rain the grey mountains sing
A sad song of winter and the howling wind
Visions of the past in the haunting dreams
Under the dead sky, under the withered trees

The night falls upon the forest that weeps
Father of shadows that forever sleeps

3. Eternal Darkness (Autumn)
[Part I Haunting Darkness]

Haunting darkness forming inside of man
Calling to return the blood of the earth
Baleful shadows gathering under the blackened sky
Reversing the evolution of the forbidden birth

Devastation of the hollow universe
Executed by wrath and absolute power
Completion of the perfect chaos
The pure destruction of stars

I am the immortal shadow
The ruler of dark dimensions
Behold my crimson nightmare
I am the creator of sorrow
Tormentor in the restless night
I am the hunter of fear, the bringer of despair
I am death
I am eternal darkness

[Part II The Call of the Dark Dream]

Unleash the dark dream, the essence of deception
The fantasy of life will blind you like the flaming sun
The clash of the opposite worlds
The cosmic war of the unnatural state has begun

Embrace the suffering and prepare for transcendent attack
Obliterate the memories and smother the past
And face the unknown! And face the unknown!

Hear the call of the final journey
Hear the call!
Hear the call of the dark dream
Calling from across the stars of old
Hear the call!
Hear the call of the dark dream

[Part III Beyond the Infinite Universe]

Wandering among the stars... Searching...
Beyond the infinite universe...
Tearing down the structures...
But I can only see darkness...

Caressed by the radiant ocean
Soaring high in the waves of sadness
Obsessed by the deepest emotions
Lost in the beautiful silence
Oh the beautiful silence!

Fall!
Falling through the layers of mind
Fall!
As the world is crumbling before my eyes
Falling through the caustic vortex
And my heart is burning by the ultimate lie
The ultimate lie!

[Part IV Death]

There is no end
There is no beginning
There is no truth
There is only darkness

And I curse you into oblivion!

I curse you for fulfilling your every desire
I curse you for your wild and relentless inner fire
Curse you for your need to breed and multiply
Curse you for your consciousness
The feeble rebellion
The great illusion
The cosmic war

I am the immortal shadow
The ruler of dark dimensions
Behold my crimson nightmare
I am the creator of sorrow
Tormentor in the restless night
I am the hunter of pain, the bringer of rain
I am death
I am eternal darkness

I am eternal
I am death

4. Loneliness (Winter)
Once I saw the light in your eyes
But nothing will be any longer the way I remember
I've become someone else and I can't go back, I tried
I'm lost in the fields of snow far from home

Follow the coast under the frozen sky
With a growing sorrow in weary eyes
Swallow the ghost of the lucid dream
And silent will be the mournful sea

The sands of life covered in white
From the darkest nights to the blinding light
I almost reached home, I was so close
But to be left alone is what hurts the most

Am I the only one awake
Am I the one who is fading away
There was so much I wanted to say
Do I have a reason anymore to stay

Washed away by the morning sun
Hear the howling call from the other side
And so much was left undone
The weight of the world quietly crushed the dying light
Washed away by the frozen stars
Feel the burning coldness of the falling snow
And one day when everything is gone
The trail in the snow disappears, am I finally home
