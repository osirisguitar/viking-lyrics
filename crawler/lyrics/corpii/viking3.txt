Deceiver Of The Gods
Since I was born they have kept me down,
They have forced me to conform.
I will tear down their holy crown in a vengeful thunder storm,
I loathe their bloody righteous ways
It fills me with despise,
Fuelling flames of violent rage,
I will be their world's demise.
Asgård's always been my home
But I'm of different blood
I will overthrow the throne
Deceiver!
Deceiver of the gods!
All this rage, and all this hate,
It burns me deep inside,
And still it is, the only thing, keeping me alive.
Dark ambition within my heart and it's aching to break free
The one true nature of my soul, the giant lives in me.
Kneel!
You all shall kneel to me!
Or death will set you free!
You all shall kneel to me!
Fall!
You all shall fall to me!
Vengeance will be sweet!
You all shall fall to me!
Asgård's always been my home
But I'm of different blood
I will overthrow the throne
Deceiver of the gods!
Asgård's always been my home
I'm born from different blood
I've come to overthrow the throne
Deceiver!
Deceiver of the gods!
Deceiver of the gods!
As Loke Falls
Yeah!
Heimdall gazes east
A sail has caught his eye
He lifts his hand and sounds the horn
The undead army has arrived
Here comes Nagelfar
With Laufey's son on board
He brings chaos, hate and wrath
He brings the war to end all wars
Heimdall knows his fate
The end of all nine worlds
It's what the Vala has foreseen
He knows that everything shall burn
Facing Lopt's deceit
Now they finally meet
The champion and his enemy
On Vigrid's plains they'll find defeat
Their swords meet in a mighty clash
War cries sound, horns they blast
Their eager weapons whip and thrash
This day when all shall end
The lords of war are equal strong
This battle frantic and forlorn
The blades sing a macabre song
This day when all shall end
Heimdall's blade bites burning sharp
As it cuts through flesh and bone
Blood comes gushing from the wound
As Loke's head falls tumbling
Rolling to the burning ground
Father Of The Wolf
So he found the heart in barren land
It was beating, still alive
He held it gently in his hand
And looked up to the sky
With evil thoughts of vicious kind
And sinister disdain
His thoughts of bringing back to life
The witch that died in flames
Serpent's kin
Born of sin
Dark within
Father of the wolf!
He then devoured Gullveig's heart
And she was born again
They brought to life an evil force
A beast that can't be tamed
With dark deception in his soul
Betrayal of the gods
The bane of Oden now is born
Born of evil blood
Serpent's kin
Born of sin
Dark within
Father of the wolf!
They brought to life a malicious force
A vile beast that cannot be tamed
Fimbultýr's nemesis now is born
A vile beast that can't be restrained
Dark!
Deception in his
Soul!
Betrayal of the
Gods!
Oden's bane is
Born!
Born of evil blood!
Serpent's kin
Born of sin
Dark within
Father of the wolf
Born of sin
Shape Shifter
I was born of giant's blood
Raised in Asgård, the home of gods
I am the master of disguise
For this trait I've gained your prise
Fast in thought, quicker tongue
Brawl with me and you'll get stung
I am the master of deceit
My words bind or set you free
I am the walker on the wind
The shape shifter
Two-faced words
And a lying grin
The shape shifter
You call me evil curse my name
But you only have yourselves to blame
Order needs its anarchy
Balance through calamity
We mixed our blood in olden days
Now I wander like a stray
We were brothers, now estranged
I will have my sweet revenge
My words are poison to your ears
I say the words you fear
Still you know it is the truth you hear
Ragnarök is drawing near
There you sit in Aegir's hall
Waiting for the coming fall
Council of the now condemned
Twilight of both gods and men
Face the facts you're old and weak
Empty words are all you speak
No escape, there's no return
The universe shall bleed and burn
I am the eagle in the sky
The shape shifter
Vicious wolf
Howling in the night
The shape shifter
I am the walker on the wind
The shape shifter
Two-faced words
And a lying grin
The shape shifter
I am the eagle in the sky
The vicious wolf
Howling in the night
I am the walker on the wind
Lying words,
With an honest grin
The shape shifter
Under Siege
Outside these walls
An army awaits
But in these halls
We feel safe
Countless attacks
We have repelled
They won't turn back
They cannot be quelled
Supplies are running low
Starvation now awaits
Reinforcements will not show
The day is much too late
Broken and weak
Never give in
Prospects are bleak
We can't win
There is no hope
No time for lament
End of the rope
Our lives are spent
We have held out for months
Hoping for relief
Our fortress now our tomb
And salvation now our grief
We have held out for months
Waiting for relief
Our fortune's now our own
This is destiny
Supplies are running low
Starvation now awaits
Reinforcements never showed
As the daylight starts to fade
There's nothing left to lose
We have run out of time
There is nothing left to choose
Except how we shall die
Open the gates!
Now we attack!
Ride into fate!
No turning back!
Stand by the King!
To glory we ride!
Weapons and shield!
Together we die!
All is lost now!
Show no fear now!
All the world shall know our bravery!
All is lost now!
Show no fear now!
One last charge for death or victory!
Blood Eagle
Yeah!
Look to my burning eyes
Plead for your worthless life
All remorse I had has died
And all I have is hate inside
You took my soul from me
You took my family
You killed them all ferociously
Now this is what I give to thee
Carved upon your naked back
Blood eagle!
Skinned alive your ribs are cracked
Blood eagle!
Still alive you gasp for air
As panic strikes your eyes they stare
Terror grips your dying heart
Blood eagle!
Helpless on the ground
Hands and feet tightly bound
In my eyes no mercy found
My sharp knife starts to carve around
Penetrate your naked skin
Rip flesh and dig within
With a pleased and twisted grin
I spread your lungs like eagle's wings
The burning grief is tormenting me
The hate I feel is destroying me
Only vengeance will give me peace
Only vengeance will set my spirit free
Carved upon your naked back
Blood eagle!
Skinned alive your ribs will crack
Blood eagle!
Still alive you gasp for air
As panic strikes your eyes will stare
Slow death grips your tortured heart
Blood eagle!
Blood eagle!
Blood eagle!
We Shall Destroy
Sword and spear
Wall of shields
Standing strong
On this their chosen battle field
Form the lines
Shield by shield
Side by side
We're marching into destiny
March as one
Don't look back
Oden's sons
Attack!
Unleash hell! Do not repent!
Warfare grants us no lament
Let your weapons slash and tear
This is no place for fear
Hold the lines! Move as one!
In unity our victory's won
Our shields will form a mighty wall
United we shall never fall
Fear will not pierce our hearts
Though swords and arrows will
Victory is our reward
For all the blood we spill
We didn't come to waste our lives
Like pawns in a savage game
Our spirits, spears
And shields are linked
In a much stronger chain
March as one
Don't look back
Oden's sons
Attack!
All are one
And one is all
Side by side
The battle calls
All are one
And one is all
Shield by shield
We'll never fall
Unleash hell! Do not repent!
Warfare grants us no lament
Let your weapons slash and tear
This is no place for fear
Charge with force! Break their ranks!
No remorse, crush their flanks!
Pulverize their human wall!
We shall destroy!
Hel
Welcome to my humble home
Your soul is mine to keep
There are no walls of rock and stone
Yet no one ever leaves
Those who die of age and plague
Are welcomed in my court
Murderers, miscreants
Will linger here and rot
Those who die inglorious
And those who die in shame
They are all sent to my dark halls
They all shall fear my name
Here hunger is your plate
Here famine is your knife
Here you will forever dwell
I welcome you to Hel
I welcome you to Hel
Now here you are in my cold realm
You are my honoured guest
At the banquette of the dead
Your soul will never rest
Your soul is mine to keep.
Your soul is mine to keep.
And you will never leave.
And you will never leave.
Here sickness is your bed
Here ruin is your fell
Here you will forever dwell
I welcome you to
Here hunger is your plate
Here famine is your knife
Here you will forever dwell
I welcome you to Hel
Coming Of The Tide
Racing 'cross the arctic lands
A mounted legion
Under my command
We're a brutal force
No men can withstand
Total havoc is at hand
See the black crows circle high
Waiting for brave men to die
They sense the coming of the tide
When opposition's swept aside
The fateful message
Reached us months ago
That our home was under siege
And since that day
We've been heading north
Our kinsmen needed our relief
As we near our fortress walls
Black smoke is rising to the sky
Burnt black ruins
Of our father's halls
And corpses greet our tired eyes
What madness led them to attack
Victory could not be won
They must've known
There was no turning back
And now they all are gone
No woman, child or man was spared
Their bodies lying where they fell
Suffering, anguish and despair
As they went through living hell
So now we're on the ride again
And vengeance is
Our newfound path
We draw our strength
From grief and pain
These bastards shall know
Our endless wrath
See the black crows circle high
Waiting for brave men to die
This is the coming of the tide
When opposition's swept aside
Warriors Of The North
We were the warriors of the north
Notorious and brave
We'd never lost a fight in war
We feared not the grave
The ruler of this northern court
My brother, lord, king
He always had our loyal swords
But we would feel his sting
The aging king had no descendants
No heir to take his throne
It filled his soul with fear
Transcendent
That next in line was my first-born
The king's heart grew
Full of dark deception
Full of foul conspiracy
This was when dark days
Had their inception
And we fell to his vile deceit
Robbed of arms, robbed of pride
But he spared our lives
The fear he had of Oden's wrath
Held his vengeful knife
With hearts so cold we left our homes
Banished from our land
A life in shame, a life in grief
Until we rise again
Winters come, winters pass
Twenty wasted years
We're aging men, our youth is gone
We will shed no tears
Winters come and winters pass
Twenty years have gone
Like a dream we fade away
Into oblivion
We are the warriors of the north
Notorious and brave
We're old but strong as before
And we don't fear the grave
From the south an army rises
They ride under cross of gold
From the shades we're called
In a time of crisis
To defend the king now weak and old
As the flames of warfare rage higher
We feel our destiny's embrace
We are aging men of an old empire
Now we can see Valhalla's gates
We!
March again
First in line
To reach Valhalla's mighty gates
We!
March again
March to fight
To reach Valhalla's mighty
We!
March again
Give our lives
To reach Valhalla's
Mighty royal gates"Där tog en nordlig vind
skeppet, så att kungen
ombord fördes med
till strid mot två kungar
De djärva kungarna
Hälsade med pilskott
Ordlöst i striden.
Sköldarnas buller räckte."
Blood red bows plough the waves
Dragon heads grin
Twenty ships with Norsemen braves
Riding the northern wind
They left their shores at early dawn
As a red sun was rising in the east
An ancient sign of coming storm
Thunder of sword and shield
Sails appear in the south
Now every man prepare
The sea will be colored by blood
Battle is drawing near
A mighty fleet of forty ships
Two kings bring lethal steel
No words spoken between enemies
Just thunder of sword and shield
A rain of arrows darkens the sun
A cloud of wood and steel
Through shields and flesh the arrows run
Bringing warriors to their knees
A war-cry loud as heimdal's horn
Fills the vibrating air
This is the place where heroes are born
And where death is always near
Here it comes the mighty storm
Every man attacks
Now is when heroes are born
There is no turning back
Where Death Seems To Dwell
"Through a dark and desolate valley he walks
Pale, flickering fires light the way
Along an ice cold river lies his path
The sky is of darkest grey
A cold wind pierce through his bones
And the sharp rocks cut his feet
His clothes and skin are ripped by thorns
His eyes appear to bleed"
The land is dead and dry
The water is poisonous
Unknown creatures howling to the sky
Blood chilling and ravenous
The air is thick and dense
A smell of rotting flesh
Every breath is like one thousand knives
Cutting through his chest
Black birds of prey circle the sky
He hears the shadows moan
He sees pale faces pass him by
But he walks this path alone
Darkness fills his heart with chilling fear
A nameless fear he cannot quell
How did he ever end up here?
This place where death seems to dwell
He repeats the question in his weary mind
The riddle gives him no rest
Yet he knows the answer deep inside
He's been touched by the chill of death
Enchanting voices urge him on
Through he wants to turn around
They sing to him with soothing words
A chilling, frighting sound
A cold blue light shimmer ahead
Where a mountain reaches for the sky
Nidafiell, mountain of the dead
Terrifying it's might
He approach the gates
his heart is cold
He understands all to well
She awaits him
The truth unfolds
He's been sent to Nifelhel
The Fate Of Norns
I feel a chill in my heart
Like lingering winter cold
I and my son are torn apart
He was just 6 winters old
My first-born was he
And the last of my kin
The last one to carry my name
Death smiled at him its deadly grin
There is no one for me to blame
The fate of Norns await us all
There is no way to escape
The day to answer Oden's call
Or walk through hel's gate
I carry him to my ship
He seems to be asleep
But the deep blue colour of his lips
Is enough to make me weep
No man should have to bury his child
Yet this has been my share
The tears i shed run bitter and wild
It's a heavy burden to bear
His body feels so light in my arms
His skin is pale as snow
Yet his weight feels heavy in my heart
As my sadness continues to grow
Allfather!
What fate has been given me?
Why must I suffer?
Why must I feel this pain?
Allfather!
LIfe has lost it's meaning to me
I think I'm going insane!
I lay him down on a pyre
A burial worthy a king
And as I lie down by his side
I hear the weaving norns sing
The fate of Norns await us all
There is no way to escape
The day to answer Oden's call
Or walk through hel's gate
The fate of Norns await us all
I know this to be true
It's time to answer Odens's call
My son, he calls for me and you
The Pursuit Of Vikings
The warming sun returns again
And melts away the snow
The sea is freed from icy chains
Winter is letting go
Standing on the ocean side
We can hear the waves
Calling us out with tide
To sail into our fate
Oden! Guide our ships
Our axes, spears and swords
Guide us through storms that whip
And in brutal war
Our ships await us by the shore
Time has come to leave
Our country, family and homes
For riches in the east
Some of us won't return
But that won't bring us down
Our fate is written in the web
Woven by the Norns
A ram is sacrificed
Across the longship's bow
And as we set our sails
A strong breeze starts to blow
It carries us out to sea
With hope of fame and pride
And glorious all will be
That with sword in hand will die
Oden! Guide our ships
Our Axes, spears and swords
Guide us through storms that whip
And in brutal war
Oden! Guide our ships
Our axes, spears and swords
Guide us through storms that whip
And in brutal war
Valkyries Ride
Soon a new day will be spawned
Scattered fires glow
Soon first blood will be drawn
And dying ambers glow
They await the suns first rays
Anticipation running high
The Norns are counting numbered days
Hear the war-cry rise
See the Valkyries ride!
See the Valkyries ride!
They meet upon this hallowed field
Now the end is near
Two armies not about to yield
The smell of death in the air
This field has served as battle ground
Since the dawn of this world
Through the years a lot of blood
Has been poured into this earth
Warrior's eyes full of purest rage
Steel cutting flesh
Spilling guts and severing heads
Sending men to their death
Ride, ride, ride Valkyries
Ride, ride, ride Valkyries
The screams of dying men
The comfort in their eyes
Here they come, by Oden sent
See the Valkyries ride
Fallen men lie all around
Their dead eyes look to the sky
And as the swordplay rambles on
They see the Valkyries ride
The Beheading Of A King
A mighty fleet came across the strait
But Erik was prepared
Five hundred Germans had come to his aid
On horseback with their spears
The fleet was carrying two thousand men
Eager to draw blood
But as they were about to land
Erik released his heards
One thousand men and five hundred horsemen
Came charging down the beach
When the sea-king saw this force
He gave order to retreat
All obeyed except one ship
It held the king's own son
He despised the thought of flight
And attacked on his own
The Danish fleet had to turn around
They charged King Erik's men
But it was too late to save his son
His life was already spent
The fighting continued bloody and fierce
And the bloodshed was immense
Two thousand warriors died that day
Most of them were Danes
The Danish king was captured
Most of his guards were dead
For a ransom he was released
Then his people took his head
Arson
They came riding at first light
Fifty men armed to the teeth
The sounding horn called us out to fight
We went to meet them with our steel
Outnumbered yet we fought
But soon we were overrun
We took refuge in our home
Our downfall had just begun
They attacked our home, we kept them out
Defending ourselves with spear and bow
We took them out one by one
As the rising autumn sun glowed
There was twenty dead on each side
When we first smelled something burn
We heard them laughing from outside
Taunting us with spiteful words
They set the house on fire
In order to smoke us out
Only five of us were still alive
And our time was running out
Raging flames surrounded us all
Our home was under siege
Crumbling roof and burning walls
There was no way to break free
As we were all about to die
We swore a sacred oath
Revenge would be claimed if someone survived
And we sealed the oath in blood
The roof caved in and cleared a path
A way out of the flames
It was decided that I'd go first
As we made for our escaped
Suddenly the walls came down
And trapped the rest inside
My closest friends died that day
Only I made it out alive
lead by Mikkonen
lead by Soderberg
Once Sealed In Blood
It's five years since I left this land
Since I left my friends to burn
Five years making bitter plans
Preparing my return
All this time my hatred's grown
The one thing on my mind
The hate in me is all I've known
The one thing keeping me alive
Bold words spreads across the land
Bragging tongues speak carelessly
Know they not what is to come
I'll hunt them down restlessly
The oath I swore, once sealed in blood
A seal between loyal friends
I swore before ancient Gods
I will have revenge
I swore! Before my Gods!
An oath! Once sealed in blood
I swore! Before my Gods!
An oath! Once sealed in blood
Now here I stand in pouring rain
As he comes riding down the path
He will learn the meaning of pain
As subject to my endless wrath
He will be the first to pay
For the bragging words he spoke
He'll regret that fateful day
My friends perished in smoke
I swore! Before my Gods!
An oath! Once sealed in blood
I swore! Before my Gods!
An oath! Once sealed in blood
I swore! Before my Gods!
An oath! Once sealed in blood
I swore! Before my Gods!
Once sealed in blood
I swore! Before my Gods!
An oath! Before my Gods!
Once sealed in blood
I swore! Before my Gods!
So here I stand on the road
With cold steel in my hand
As he looks into my unforgiving soul
His tears begins to run
One man down to go
Consider yourselves warned
I'm coming for the rest of you
And will have no remorse
The first man I killed was the earl's right-hand man
When he came to take her away
I ran his own sword straight through his throat
And then I stood there, watching him fade
The first blood I spilled was the blood of a varg
I had to wipe his smile away
I was not yet a man, nor was I a boy
But still, I made that bastard pay
So I left him there, on the stable floor
Bathing in a pool of his own blood
My one and only choice was to flee this land
To leave this wretched place for good
I am an outcast
All alone
I'm a nomad without home
I am an outlaw
I'm disowned
And I am no man's son
Through the cold midwinter nights on a southbound winding path
The stars and moon my only light and the earl's men closing fast
I swore that I'd return that I would see him burn
I will live it in my dreams the smell, the blood, his dying screams
To my father I was dead, he took his hand from me
He drove me away, I was shunned
My one and only choice was to leave this land
To become the pagan they would hunt
I am an outcast
All alone
I'm a nomad without home
I am an outlaw
I'm disowned
And I am no man's son
I am an outcast
All alone
I'm a nomad without home
I am an outlaw
I'm disowned
And I am no man's son
I journey through this frozen land on my own
There's no shelter anywhere down the road
When this mystic wanderer comes around
And the dying hope in my heart starts to grow
This vagrant offers help when there was none
To this outlawed murder on the run
Through the snowy mountains we roam
Mu journey towards freedom has now begun
On the run
All alone
Hope is gone
Wanderer
A blizzard hit with blinding force
The wind cut through the bone
And amidst the blur of snow
I found myself alone
Freezing winds brought me down
I laid myself to rest
In the deep, chilling cold
I knew I'd freeze to death
Left alone I had no choice
But to accept my fate
When the wanderer returned
Then I knew that my life was saved
On the run
All alone
Hope is gone
Wanderer
On the run
Not alone
Hope returns
Wanderer
Drifting alone upon the dragon ship
Eerily still, no winds that tear or whip
Silence deafens, the sea is mirror calm
Blood runs like the water from my palm
I'm standing by myself
Abiding
Just me and no one else
No hiding
Horizon crumbles under flaming skies
A shadow screams from thunderclouds up high
Nidhogg comes in winds of burning flames
Cast down war and endless pain
It's coming
Brace myself
I'm ready
It's coming
No escape
Stand steady
Out on this bloody sea I'll face my destiny
Lost in a dreadful dream I'll meet my fate
Out on this blood sea, this is my prophecy
A notion of what's to be, there's no escape
The dragon sweeps down with a roar
Sky and ocean shake
It tears up waves of blood and gore
The longship nearly breaks
Passing just above my head
A stench of putrid death
Rotting flesh of thousands dead
Dwells upon its breath
I turn around
Face myself
Yet it isn't I
With fear and rage
I run me through
As I watch me die!
Out on this bloody sea, I'll face my destiny
Lost in a dreadful dream, I'll meet my fate
Out on this bloody sea, this is my prophecy
A notion of what's to be, there's no escape
Get ready!
Stand steady!
It's coming
Brace myself
Abiding
It's coming
Certain death
No hiding
Winter's lost its grip
The ocean is set free
The ship glides through the broken ice
Out to an open sea
North winds fill the sails
They fly on frothing seas
As hope grows stronger in his heart
It's easier to breathe
Days turn into nights
Nights turn into days
His determination grows
With every breath he takes
There he stands alone, one man against all
With a sword in each hand, soon he will fall
There he stands alone, one man against all
With a sword in each hand, heeding the call
When the reach the Hano bay
There waits a ship of war
Like the bear attacks its prey
It comes at them with force
All men to the oars!
Row for all your worth!
Most likely this will be your last day
On this wretched earth!
The weak they try to run
But he's prepared to fight
One by one his friends are slain
Only he remains
He knows the end is near
They have him in their jaws
When a noble man appears
He tells them, "Withdraw!"
There he stands before him
As the skirmish quells
He offers him,
"Join our crew or join your friends in hell."
There he stands alone, one man against all
With a sword in each hand, and soon he will fall
There he stands alone, one man against all
With a sword in each hand, he's heeding the call
Victory
We fought hard and prevailed
Brutally
We were fighting
Stormy seas
Rolling thunder, piercing hail
Battlefield
Lit by lightning
Eagerly
We filled the waves with enemies
Hungrily
Ravens cawing
Home shore calls
We return on bloody seas
Twilight falls
Darkness crawling
So pour the beer for thirsty men
A drink that they have earned
And pour a beer for those who fell
For those who did not return
Raise your horns!
Raise them up to the sky!
We will drink to glory tonight
Raise your horns for brave fallen friends
We will meet where the beer never ends
No regrets
We went out to war and strife
To protect
King and country
Victory
Honor those who gave their life
Willingly
We will not grieve
So pour the beer for thirsty men
A drink that they have earned
And pour a beer for those who fell
For those who did not return
Raise your horns!
Raise them up to the sky!
We will drink to glory tonight!
Raise your horns!
Raise them up to the sky!
We will drink tonight!
Raise your horns!
Raise them up to the sky!
We will drink to glory tonight
Raise your horns
For brave fallen friends
We will meet in Valhalla again
Whirling dust in morning air
Two warriors in the ring
With the strength of two great bears
They make their weapons sing
Sparks fly high when steel meets steel
And no one can believe
That these two men are best friends
Not enemies
They lash out with ferocious force
The fight grows more intense
But each avoid the other's sword
As if by seventh sense
Their muscles ache, their bones are sore
But none of them will yield
They fight a two-man practice war
As enemies
Faster!
Stronger!
Fight until your dying breath!
Fiercer!
Harder!
This is a matter of life and death!
Full on fight in training
It's the way of vikings
Every muscle straining
It's the way of the Jomsvikings
These men aim to shatter
It's the way of vikings
This is how we battle
It's the way of the Jomsvikings
Whirling dust in morning air
Two warriors in the ring
With the strength of two great bears
They make their weapons sing
Sparks fly high when steel meets steel
And no one can believe
That these two men are best friends
Not enemies
Sun beats down with intense heat
The swordsmen start to break
Pain shoots through their tired feet
With every step they take
In this fight of iron wills
One man takes a knee
The other goes for the kill
Like an enemy
Faster!
Stronger!
Fight until your dying breath!
Fiercer!
Harder!
This is a matter of life and death!
Full on fight in training
It's the way of vikings
Every muscle straining
It's the way of the Jomsvikings
These men aim to shatter
It's the way of vikings
This is how we battle
It's the way of the Jomsvikings
At dawn's first light
Run for your lives
Viking ships come out of the mist
Ominous sight
Flee or stand fast
You won't last
Warlords invade with axe and blade
Attack at first light
Unstoppable force
No remorse
Under attack, no turning back
You cannot run
Nowhere to hide
No shelter inside
Under attack, no turning back
Slaughter's begun
Nowhere to hid
No shelter inside
Slashing, killing
Thrashing, spilling
Blood for honor, death, and glory!
Out of the night
At dawn's first light
Longships arrive
Run for your lives!
Wounds won't mend your bitter end
Death to all
Flee or fight
No one survives
Bloodshed won't stop
'Til the last drop
You will fall
It matters not how hard you fought
Under attack, no turning back
You cannot run
Nowhere to hide
No shelter inside
Under attack, no turning back
Slaughter's begun
Nowhere to hid
No shelter inside
Slashing, killing
Thrashing, spilling
Blood for honor, death, and glory!
The ships bring terror to these shores
Death and all out war
Their oars are cutting through the waves
Like spades are digging graves
At dawn's first light
Run for your lives
Out of the night
At dawn's first light
Longships arrive
Run for your lives!
They bring him to the shore
His ship is ready made
He will not see them anymore
Here he cannot stay
The brotherhood is gathered
Their faces hard as stone
They have come to take farewell
In silence they mourn
"Our king has left our ranks
a wise and noble man
We owe him loyalty and thanks
He ruled with a steady hand
He will be missed by all
His heart has now been stilled
Tonight he'll dine in Odin's Hall
There he'll drink his fill"
The ship glides gently on the waves
As day turns into night
One thousand burning arrows
Fill the starlit sky
Two ravens on the longship
They spread their pitch-black wings
And lift up to the burning sky
A send-off for a king!
Into flames! The longship burst into flames!
Black smoke is rising high
To the eternal night
Into flames! The whole world burst into flames!
Nothing will be the same
Things will forever change
The flames are raging higher
They gnaw at wood and flesh
Soon the ship will break apart
And sink into the depth
This night we wait in silence
And when the morning breaks
Our king has left this world to walk
Through Valhalla's gates
The odds are stacked against me
Outnumbered three to one
These men are seasoned warriors
But I stand my ground
Waiting
Let them come
Ready
Cut them down
No chainmail for protection
I don't have a shield
Surprise my one advantage
Keeping my sword concealed
Hidden
Out of sight
Ready
Prepared to bite
The first man's coming at me
I am not afraid
The time has finally come now
To introduce my blade
Flashing
Fear its name
Slashing
Feel the pain
This is my sword
We are one and the same
My enemies' woe
Vengeance the name
The blade is swift and ruthless
It deals in death and harm
And as he tries to grab me
It cuts through his arm
First cut
Blood is shed
Dripping
Snow turns red
I've struck fear in their hearts
Now let the slaughter start
This is my sword
We are one in the same
My enemies' woe
Vengeance the name
This is my sword
The dealer of pain
Death of my foe
Vengeance the Game
The next man over reaches
And so he winds up dead
One cut is all that's needed
I removed his head
There's only one left standing
He's lost the will to fight
I point my sword towards him
He quickly takes flight
Running
From my sword
Victory
My reward
This is my sword
We are one and the same
My enemies' woe
Vengeance the name
This is my sword
The dealer of pain
Death of my foe
Vengeance my aim
Years of wait are over now
She's almost in my grasp
Now I will fulfill my vow
She will be mine at last
I feel him near
The boy estranged has now returned a full grown man,
But still I fear that nothing's changed
He simply does not understand
Come with me
I'll set you free
And I'll show you
What your life could be
You can't see
That I am free
My life is mine, not yours.
So leave me be
Through forests deep, over mountains high
I've crossed the waves for her
In shadows dark, this cursed night
My thoughts and memories stir
I've left the memories
Of our youth behind
I don't know what he hopes to find
In the shadows he waits for me
For a dream that cannot be
Come with me
I'll set you free
And I'll show you
What your life could be
You can't see
That I am free
My life is mine, not yours.
So leave me be
She refuses to leave
So I grab her by force
I pull the knife I've concealed
I put the edge to his throat
Shocked by the attack
I can feel her final words sear
Leave and never come back
Or I'll cut you ear to ear
You can't see
That I am free
My life is mine, not yours.
So leave me be
I'll set you free
He said to me
And I'll show you what your life could be
I am free
She said to me
My life is mine, not yours.
So leave me be
A thick fog lies ahead
The ocean's deadly calm
Their ship glides on the silent waves
Into the unknown
He cannot turn around
For him it's much too late
He puts his back into the oar
And rows towards his fate
The ship cuts through
The milk white mist
Through the blind they clearly hear
The oar strokes of their mighty fleet
Battle's drawing near
His heart pounds loud and wild
He's waited for this day
Then suddenly a dragon's head
Appears out of the haze
Back on the Northern shores
Just as he once swore
He vowed to return
And to make them burn
Then a Northern wind picks up
It sweeps the mist away
A might viking fleet appears
Patiently they wait
"Death or victory!"
Words by which they stand
No turning back! In for the kill!
Led by thy command!
"All men grab your swords and shields
The enemies lay ahead!
We'll make this bay our battlefield
and fill the waves with dead!"
Darkness then descends
Day turns into night
A massive cloud of thousand arrows
Fills the misty sky
With violent force
The two fleets crash
The battle now begins
Cries of war as weapons clash
Uncertain who will win
Thunder rolls 'cross the waves
Lightning cracks the sky
Clouds release hail big as grapes
As arrows are let fly
Hear the berserks roar!
They call to mighty Thor!
The fury in their raging eyes
Will burn forever more
Hear the weapons sing!
Feel the arrows sting!
They climb onto the Earl's great ship
And begin to swing
The fight is fierce as they attack
With sword and axe, no guts, no glory!
Arrow pierced, they won't back down
They battle on with heart and fury
Then it turns
The flanking ships give way
And soon they are embattled
Standing firm! Fight 'til death!
They refuse to die like cattle
Fighting for his life
No holds barred
So close to revenge
Close but yet so far
Then he stands before him
It's like the battle fades
He sees his father's eyes
As he's struck into the waves
Back on Northern shores
Just as he once swore
He has met his fate
In these cold dark waves
He looks to clouds up high
A dead and distant stare
She comes out of the light
See the chariot flare
Standing on the shore
He hears her silent call
Freja leads him through the door
Into the great hall
As his life's blood leaving
I hold my son, my only son
And tears fill my burning eyes
While his skin turns pale as snow
Butchered he lies here bleeding in my arms
Slewn by the men of the single god
Hatred burns in my chest
Rain falls from a raging heaven
The wind howls like wolves at the moon
I will seek my vengeance for my son
I swear I'll avenge my first born one
I ride fast through the woods
My friends are by my side
Dark hatred burns in my eyes
"Slaves of hvitekrist today you die!"
"Mäktiga gudar,
i gyllene salen.
Hjälp mig i striden
mot sondräparna,
Den höge skall
för huggen hämnas
och blod skall gäldas
i blod"
Our cloaks fly in the wind
As we ride in the cold dark night
We're closing in our enemies
We rage in our hearts burning bright
The clouds scatter in the northern wind
A full moon rides the pitch black sky
"Now, hounds of Hvitekrist,
your time has come to die!"
"Kneel before my sword!
No mercy! Your time has come to die!
This is the ride for vengeance!"
The Dragon's Flight Across The Waves
Alone he stands in the doorway
His family still asleep
Gazing at the starlit horizon
And the moonsparkling sea
When dawn comes he must leave them
His home, his children and loved
For his destiny beyond those waves
Known only to the Norns
He's already dressed ready to leave
His four friends are waiting by the shore
Each with a dragon ship
And one hundred men prepared for war
He returns to his bed kissing
His sleeping wife goodbye
And as he leaves his youngest son
A tear rolls from his eye
They set sail with the first morning rays
Heading for glorious wars
And as the five ships steer out from the bay
Their hearts pound like never before
The wind is strong, the sun is warm
Their Dragons fly across the waves
No greenfaces are seen here onboard
Only a crowd of braves
Many nights pass
And days long as a year
They await the battle
They await without fear
On the morning of the fifth day
Before the sun arose
They hear bells chime and see pyres
Torched at a nearby coast
"LOWER THE SAIL, GRAB YOUR OARS,
NOW MEN IT'S TIME TO ACT!
ROW LIKE THE WIND TO THE SHORE,
ROW LIKE THE WIND TO ATTACK!"
Without Fear
I see
Without fear my destiny
As the raging skies begins to fade
Pouring rain
Licks my wounds as my blood flows
From my torn flesh!
As I die
I hold my sword
My only friend
And pray that Oden
Will take me home
The battle rages
But I hear only raindrops falling
Like in slow motion to the ground
Death release me
Free me from my earthly pain
Oden I ask thee please
Take me home
Without fear I die!
As I look
To the sky the heaven is lit
And Valkyries in shining armour
Descend
I rest my head
On the ground
And close my eyes
I know that Oden's sent for me
As I die
Without fear I die
I hold my sword
And die
Without fear
Victorious March
Ten heavy feet
Walk the bloodsoiled ground
With rhythm these
Five warriors march
No matter how much
The bleeding wounds
From enemy swordcuts
Hurt to the bone
The revenge they sought
Was taken in blood
No mercy was showed
No mercy was showed
They ignore the pain
That hammerlike pounds
From falls, off slain horses,
To the ground
No signs of weakness
No signs of weariness
Not even a glimpse
Of remorse in their eyes
They slew men ruthless
Fed the wolves with flesh
And now they leave
This land side by side
Now they're headed home
Five swordsmen who fought repentlessly
Their story will be told
Of five brave men endlessly
All sorrow is left
For the women to bare
The children cries
They live in fear
No man was spared
No house or farm remains
No christian woman unraped
Their church consumed by flames
Their steel shines red
With enemy blood
It sings of victory
Granted by the Gods
And as they return
Bleeding but proud
The horizon burns
And the song is ringing loud
Friends Of The Suncross
Salt water licks my face
and wind fills the sail
We head for wars on distant shores
My friends are all with me
And so they'll always be
We'll never bend untill the end
We cross the open waves
On course to far off lands
Thor guides our ships
With his strong hands
Across the waves our seasnakes fly
Carried like ravens in the sky
By heavens breath on wings of death
Blood will run red
As we sever bodies from their heads
We maim and kill by pure will
We hail our Gods
Sacrifice in blood
Our altar is the battlefields
Death is something we don't fear
Though it's always near
Ygg brings us home when time has come
We are five of us
Friends of the suncross
Strong and brave to the grave!
Abandoned
They came riding down the slopes
Five fearless men prepared to fight
We heard with fear the rumbling earth
In the mid-day light
Surprised we saw all terrified
The brave northmen's run
The fearless five with power ride
Attacking us in the mid-day sun
Their charge was fast, no alarm was sound
They broke right through our lines
I felt the cut it threw me to the ground
And now I feel has come my time
I lie here in my blood
And see my family get killed
I feel abandoned by my god
I fear death's chill
I see Hel's gates
Towering high
And dark are they
I don't want to die
Oh no! I was wrong
Denied the true gods
And now I'm doomed
I trusted foreign men
And their god's son
But now when I need them
They are gone
I see Hel's gates
Towering high
And dark are they
I die!
They ride across the planes
And punish those of false belief
All resistance is in vain
As they caress them with cold steel
They are the punishers
And they will never bend
They are power the five of them
From Asgard they are sent
The power they have in all they do
The Christians non will feel
No one can escape them no
They will make them kneel
Their fight is through, they must return
No one here survived
And as the blood red sky begins to burn
To Valhall they will ride
Amon Amarth
A storm rolls in from the sea
Covering the land with black thunder clouds
Rain whips the ground at their feet
As they come ashore in this foreign land
Thunder brakes the silence
Of fivehundred men assembled ashore
Gazing through the misty rain
At the mountain not a mile away
So dark and silent it stands there
The mighty AMON AMARTH
Reaching for the cloudcloked skies
So grim and fearful in might
With the wind in their backs they start walking
Decisive men of the north
They strive through this darkened land
With only mount doom in their sight
The closer they get to the mountain
The clearer their eyes can see
A forest of one thousand spears awaiting
Awaiting the battle that will be
A cry of war emerges
Echoes over the field
Warriors run, like wolves up the sloaps
Boldley charging the enemy lines
With weapons so fearsome and sharp in their hands
And shields of oakwood and steel
They slit open stomachs and split skulls to the jaw
Intestants cover the field
The defenders are weak in this brutal war
The northmen have power and guts
A bloodshed like no one has seen here before
None can escape their cuts
Arrows with fire fly through the air
Touching houses and shields
The Vikings can feel victory is near
As the enemy headlessly flees
A gust of wind blows in from the north
Clearing the clouds away
As twilight falls and the stars come forth
And the seawolves return to the bay
Corpses lie scattered all over the field
For the ravens to eat as they please
The mountain is now left there behind
As they sail with the first morning breeze
Once Sent From The Golden Hall
Rumbling thunder cracks the sky
And rain starts pouring down
Lightning strikes a cold bright light
Upon the blooddrenched ground
The sword play is hard
And many fall
Steel bites sharp in flesh
And upon a mountain
Towering tall
Stand the messengers of death
Five horsemen in armour bright
Waiting in the flashing light
Looking down upon the field
Where Vikings fight with axe and shield
On stallions black as night
With eyes burning red
They ride with thunder to the fight
Deliverance of certain death
A warcry loud as Heimdall's horne
Echoes across the land
Enemies who hear it freeze to the bone
Friends of doom proudly stand
They ride faster than the wind
With lightning speed they strike
Black ravens follow where they've been
To feed from those who died
With power they wield their swords
As they ride down fleeing men
Sending them to Hel's dark court
To never come back again
The warriors ride once more
To the mountain from which they came
Once sent by the gods to war
And they never return in shame(Balder) Nightmares
Demons haunt my taunted mind
I'm scared
My death's forseen ungloryful
Plase Father
Make my demons disappear
Please Mother
Death is everywhere
(Odin) My son I've seen your fear
I have felt your pain
No harm will come to you
An oath has been sworn
(Balder) The evil forces around us
Still wants to destroy me
Who is the evil slayer
I cannot see
Loke the deceitful God
Discover the arrow of death
Pointed for the Hoder the blind
by the jealous Loke
The arrow cut through the skin
And into the heart of the bright one
Silence spread throughout the hall Aesir
As the God of Light fe to his knees dying!
Sorrow throughout the nine worlds
The bright God is gone
Sent to Nifelheim by the deceitful...
The Arrival Of The Fimbul Winter
The bleak fimbul winter arrived
Raging across the world
With a fury that defied the memory of man
Terrible wars where fought,
the like had never been seen
Men slew without a thought
The ties of kinship were no more
Skoll and Hati, the ravenous wolves
Arose and devoured the sun and the moon
Darkness descended upon the earth
And the stars fell from the skies
Loud blows heimdall the horne's in the air
Odin quests the head of Mim
Now shakes the holy ash where it stands
The ancient tree moans, Fenris breaks free
How are the Aesir?
How are the Alves?
Loud sounds Joutunheim
Aesir comprise
By the stonedoors dwarfs are moaning
The mountains wise men
Know you now or not?
With his shield at hand
Hrym travels from the east
The serpant is turning, enormous in rage
The serpant breaks the waves
The eagle screams
Nidhoggs tearing corpses
Free comes Nagelfar
Loke leads the legions of the dead
In holy war
Against the justice made by Aesir
Burning Creation
Surtur comes from the south
With red hot fire wargods swords
shines like the sun
Mountains breaks, men on hel-road
The heaven crumbles, Ragnarok is at hand
Then to Hlin appears
Another grief when Odin goes to fight
The evil Fenris
And the brave and glory Frey
goes against Surtur
Then will Friggs beloved one die
Vidar,Odin's mighty son,
he will come to slay the wolf
The sword runs into the
heart of Hverdrungs son
So he avenges his father
So comes Llodyns noble son
Thor he goes to fight the snake
In anger he slays the guardian of Midgaard
Nine steps dying walks Odin's son
Away from the snake who misdeeds not fear
Dying from it venom
When all are gone
Only Surtur remained
Passing his hand of fire
across the whole world
Consuming all of creation
The Mighty Doors Of The Speargod's Hall
A battle on a distant shore
Seawolves' wrath sweeps the land
Down from the sky Valkyries ride
And walk the field, hallowed by Tyr
The fight is hard, axes swung
Swords bite sharp, men are slain
The ground turns red, blood-soaked field
Dead man's last bed and Oden sees
Vikings fall, in blood they lie
The web of Horns
They've met their fate
With shield and sword
They're brought in pride
To mighty doors of the Speargod's hall
The gates open and into the hall of braves
They silently walk
The one-eyed sits in glory might
Raises his cup and says:
"Pl vida faltet
Harman svingat
Det blankat svardet
Oeh banen mott
Till den hoges sal
De i ara forts
Oeh vid mjodet hor
Oden kvada"
Dawn breaks. The Einherjer goes to
Relive their last fight
With passion, swords held high
As they ride in the morning mist
The sun warms the air
War cries sound
"Tor Hjelpe!"
The battle begins
Charging horses with fire in breath
Rush to battle - in glory die!
Swords sing in joy
Again they cut
With shining edges
Blood-stained steel
Axes shine, again they're swung
Ripping flesh - death be done
The cold night comes
With charging darkness
To Oden's hall
The Einherjer return
A feast awaits until the next day
When warriors' eyes again shall burn
Under The Grayclouded Winter Sky
Grey clouds - cover the winter sky
Cold snow - falls like autumn leaves to the ground
The icy wind
Pierces the skin of waiting warriors
Like spears
Will pierce their bodies in battle
Frosted
Beards on pale grey faces
Eyes of death
Are burning with rage
Glancing across the fields of Tyr
In the early morning light
Grey clouds - cover the winter sky
Cold snow - falls like autumn leaves to the ground
The icy wind
Pierces the skin of waiting warriors
Like spears
Will pierce their bodies in battle
War cries break the silent wait
Charging warriors rush to kill
Swords are swung in the air
The gods of war are called
Vikings with fire in soul
Clash on the open field
Slaying with powerful strokes
The snow is turning red
Hooves gallop the plains
Warlords on horsebacks
Ride into battle
With a thunderous roar
The storm wind of death
Blows across the field
Sweeping with it
Everything in its way
So the battle settles
Alone stands just one man
Under the grey-clouded winter sky - alone. . .War, the very first war of our world,
When the treacherous witch was killed
Three times burned and three times born,
By searing flames was Gullveig torn.
Death, Odin hurled his spear off with great force
Deep into the great vana-fyrd
battle horns gave up their sound
And Asgard walls razed to the ground.
The Vanir felt deceived
Hœnir was a fool
without Mímir at his side
Hœnir could not rule
In a fit of violent rage
Mímir's blood was shed
and to Odin's court they sent Mímir's severed head
Truce, so a brittle and frail peace was forged
And to ensure that the peace remained.
Njordr and Freyr to Asgard came
and Hön' and Mim to Vanaheim
Death, see the furious gods wanting blood,
Odin knew that a raging war
would not bring them any gain
Just leave a black and bitter stain.
Odin tog huvudet och
smorde det med örter
som hindrar det
från att ruttna
han kvad sedan
trollsånger över det
så att Mimer åter
kunde tala till honom
Odin took the head, and anointed it with herbs
which prevents it from rotting
he sang his magic songs over it
so that Mimer be able to speak to him
The Vanir felt deceived
Hœnir was a fool
without Mímir at his side
Hœnir could not rule
In a fit of violent rage
Mímir's blood was shed
and to Odin's court they sent Mímir's severed head
Töck's Taunt - Loke's Treachery Part II
You come to me, eyes full of grief
you ask of me to shed all my tears
to let him return from kingdom of fears
Why should I weep? or lose any sleep?
He never brought me pleasure or glee
so why would I help to set Balder free
You come to me,eyes full of grief
all of your tears mean nothing to me
so why will you not just leave me to be
am I to blame? Well, I'm not ashamed!
Oh how I smiled when I heard the tale
Of Loke the sly, so clever and brave
Höder the fool,Lopt's willing tool
he held the twig that cut Balder's skin
Lopt aimed the shot
that killed Höder's twin
leave me alone
don't come here and moan
I've never wished to see Balder's well
so let his soul remain down in hel
My name is Töck and I won't cry
I won't let Balder return
Let hel keep her treasured prize
let his soul forever burn
You come to me and cannot believe
that this old crow now talking to you
is Loke not Töck you bloody dawn fools
you come to me and you do not see
all of your tears mean nothing to me
why will you not just leave me to be
My name is Töck,and I won't cry
I won't let Balder return
Let hel keep her treasured prize
let his soul forever burn
Destroyer Of The Universe
I rise up from muspelheim
My fury is sublime
The sword I bring burns violently
With wild and lethal flames
I march against the asagods
To bring the end of time
I am pure and endless pain
And Surtur is my name
See me rise, the mighty Surt
Destroyer of the universe
Bringer of flames and endless hurt
Scorcher of men and earth
Swordless frej with horn in hand
Rises to his final stand
He doesn't stand a single chance
I'll split his living corpse in half
And yet he stabbed me in the eye
He drove the horn in deep
The overwhelming, raging pain
Is driving me insane
The waves of flames that
I've unleashed will eat us all alive
The rage that burns within my heart
Is uncontrolled and wild
And now everything shall die!
Massive waves consume us all, the ocean is released
Our dying world quakes underneath
And sinks into the sea
And now nothing will survive!
Extinction waits for everyone
For gods and men alike
When all are gone of the old world
A new one will arise
See me rise, the mighty Surt
Destroyer of the universe
Bringer of flames and endless hurt
Scorcher of men and earth
See me die, the mighty Surt
Destroyer of the universe
Drowning in waves that floods the earth
The beginning, of a new rebirth
Slaves Of Fear
They speak of love and tolerance
They thrive on people's ignorance
To make you all slaves of fear
They feed on your anxiety
To build their dead society
They've kept you down for a thousand years
They nurture prejudice and hate
Condemn the wars that they create
In the name of whatever god
They gladly sacrifice your lives
Increasing power is their prize
Without regrets they'll spill your blood
They're feeding you lies
With calculating smiles
Enslavement of the human mind
As long as you kneel to their authority
Religion is what makes you blind
They're treating you as mindless fools
And use you as obedient tools
It's time to set your spirit free
This world we cannot tolerate
It's time to seal all preachers' fate
And let them hang from Oden's tree
Your minds are restrained
Obedience is the chain
They've locked you up and thrown away the key
Your souls are for sale,
And you're the ones who pay
But still you'll never be set free
They're feeding you lies
With calculating smiles
Enslavement of the human mind
As long as you kneel to their authority
Religion is what makes you blind
Live Without Regrets
From birth we're taught how to survive
We're taught how war is waged
And there are no men now alive
Who stops our wild rampage
Light at heart we bide our bane
whatever death awaits!
Norsemen live without regrets
We accept our woven fates
So fearlessly we charge ahead
There is no time to hesitate
Don't despair, show no fear
Live your life without regrets
Don't despair and show no fear
In the face of a certain death
A coward thinks he'll always live
If it keeps himself from strife
Old age leaves no rest and peace
though spears may spare his life
We don't mourn a friend that fell
or dread the day we'll fall ourselves
Warriors don't go to Hel
'cause we know Ygg will greet us well!
Fearlessly we charge ahead
There is no time to hesitate
Don't despair, show no fear
Live your life without regrets
Don't despair and show no fear
In the face of a certain death
So raise your horns to those who died
Let's drink to fallen friends tonight
Let's celebrate their glory life
We'll meet again in Valhall when we die
When we die!
When we die!
The Last Stand Of Frej
See him rise, from land of flames
our destruction is at hand.
It is time to make stand
now I face, and awesome foe
I will always stand my ground
To this end my fate is bound!
This fight is mine and mine alone
and there's no help from anyone!
His wrath burns!
With insane heat
all his fury is unleashed
there is no way to defeat!
The forces and the power that he wields
My hand holds the horn so firm
I am calm and ready to die
Everything around me burns
And I know that I will not survive
See him rise from land of flames
in this wild and barren land
I will make my final stand
My death awaits, I have no fear
To this end my fate is bound
though I'm doomed
I'll stand my ground!
This fight is mine and mine alone
and there's no help from anyone!
I go forth to meet my doom
but I will die in vain
perdition waits for everyone
The world will die in flames
With all my strength I run the horn
deep into his eye
And as he swings his burning sword
I die with a tired smile!
For Victory Or Death
Time!
has come to wash our shame away
to erase the image of defeat
We!
have licked our wounds,restored our strength
and our vengeance will be oh so sweet
They thought they had us down
that we'd never rise again
they will learn that they were deadly wrong
what's owed will be repaid
Again we'll feed the wolves
and then vengeance will be ours
we'll split their skulls and spill their guts
upon the frozen ground
Yeah,we'll never kneel again
not to deity nor men
now they'll taste our bitter hate
what's owed will be repaid
So raise the flag once more
and the eagle will be fed
once again we march to war
for victory or death
They arrived with talk of hvitekrist
by force they wanted us to kneel
with their swords held to our throats they preached
but we will make them pay we'll take their lives away
So Raise!
raise the flag once more
in the east the eagle will be fed
March!
again we march to war
we will march for victory or death
Pain!
the pain and suffering
is but a bleak and distant fading dream
Shame!
our disgrace a withering thought
finally our names will be redeemed
Wrath Of The Norsemen
My head hurts like hell
Can't open my eyes
My clothes are all wet
And I'm freezing right through
Don't know where I am
Or how to get home
My arms they're so numb
And it's hard to get up
My muscles they ache
With every move
I stand on my feet
But my knees feel so weak
Somebody wake me
From this horrible dream
Somebody save me
From this terror I feel
I stumble around
on the soft muddy ground
I call out the name
of the friends I can't find
but only the wind
And the ravens reply
With every gasp
with every breath
smoke fills my lungs
and my intestines wrench
With every gasp
the sweet taste of death
The air is full of a thick
pungent stench
So comes then rain
it's colder than ice
I wash off my face
and open my eyes
And then I see
but wish I were blind
They are all dead
there's blood everywhere
The Norsemen they left
only death and despair
A stench of flesh
that fills the Autumn air
Somebody wake me
From this horrible dream
Somebody save me
From this terror and pain
No one can save me
From this horrible dream
No one can hear me
Or my heart-wrenching screams
A Beast Am I
Conceived was I
From chaos and hate
Of malice, deceit and blood
And how would they know
My fate is to rise
Against the Asagods
My being is full, full of a rage
An evil that can't be tamed
It darkens my soul
And blackens the blood
A fire that fills my veins
So how
Did I ever end up here?
Humiliated, broken and weak
I've waited
For a thousand years
To break these chains apart and
To finally break myself free
I bit the hand, off the mighty Tyr
When I couldn't, tare my ties
Now banished I dwell
A sword in my jaw
awaiting the end of time
In darkness I drown
Consumed by my hate
Longing for revenge
Allfather will pay
For his deceit
At the battle
Of Ragnarök
A beast am I
So vicious and grim
They fear my mean
Grinning teeth
I bide my time
my sweet revenge
Soon my ties will fall
And finally I will be free
So when you hear me howling
You'll know that I have come for you
When you hear me call your name
Your life will end in nameless pain
Conceived was I
From chaos and hate
Of malice, deceit and blood
And how would they know
My fate is to rise
Against the Asagods
My being is full, full of a rage
An evil that can't be tamed
It darkens my soul
And blackens the blood
A fire that fills my veins
A beast am I
So vicious and grim
They fear my mean
Grinning teeth
I bide my time
my sweet revenge
Soon my ties will fall
And finally I will be!
Finally break myself!
Finally I will be free!
Doom Over Dead Man
The autumn clouds are caving in
And night comes crawling, black as sin
Lightning strikes, and rain begins
A storm that tears my soul
I toss and tumble in my bed
My thoughts are spinning in my head
Darkness nears, soon I'll be dead
I'm losing all control
I've spent my life in foolish quests
for gold and riches, I confess
And now I'm left with just regrets
Too late to change my ways
My life, it seems, has slipped away
I leave no legacy to praise
Nothing more for me to say
My life has been a waste
When!
My time has come for me to leave
When!
When judgment's passed upon my life
When!
A cold dark grave will wait for me
Will!
Will my name live endlessly?
When!
My time has come for me to leave
When!
When judgment's passed upon my life
When!
A cold dark grave will wait for me
Will!
Will my name live endlessly?
So I die
But won't be mourned
Broken and alone
I wish that I were never born
So I die and won't be missed
No rune stone will be raised
As my body rots away
Die!
All friends and cattle pass away
Die!
And death will come for every man
Die!
But I know one thing never dies
Doom!
The sentence passed upon the dead
Now!
The time has come for me to leave
Now!
When judgement's passed up on my life
Now!
Now I will rest in my dark grave
Will!
They speak my name with reverence?
My life has been a waste
No rune stone will be raised
So I die, but won't be mourned
I wish that I were never born
I rest here in my shallow grave
As my body rots away
Making way through blades and spears
We attack at dawn
The glory scene is near
From northern gods we're spawned
Defender's fighting spirit crack
Torching house of single god
We leave land burnt black
And bodies floating in blood
War to us is holy
We sacrifice our blood
War to us is holy
We bleed for ancient Gods
Blasting forth with rage in our war eyes
We burn with hate
Cut our way through hordes of weak Christian flesh
Cast them into death
WAR!
War to us is holy
We sacrifice our blood
War to us is holy
We bleed for ancient Gods
Burn away the false and untrue ones
We make them kneel
To the only true and powerful Gods
And then we kill
WAR!
The Last With Pagan Blood
We storm ahead with swords and shields
For victory we ride
We fight the world on these battlefields
To re-erect the pagan pride
We draw the blood of those in our way
It's 'victory or die
With pounding, raging fury we slay
The Christian hounds will pay
Charge ahead, no retreat
No mercy, none shall live
To us there is no defeat
No remorse to give
A wind of power blows from the north
The enemy shivers to the core
We slay with strength, pushing forth
Silence before the storm
The gates of Valhalla open up
The ground beneath us shakes
As Odin leads the Gods to war
The Rainbow Bridge cracks
Nothing can stop this final attack
We carve up all in our path
Now there is no turning back
Final battle is here at last
A feast awaits us when we return
Awaiting all that fought in wrath
By the long fires we sit in glory
And beer will cool our soar throats
We are few but strong in will
The last with pagan blood
We fought the world with burning steel
Now we sit in Hall of Gods
Pride and glory in our hearts
Pride and glory in our hearts
North Sea Storm
Above my heads mighty men battle
Flashing blades rip through the air
Cracking shields with rumbling thunder
Rolling over the waves
Blood pours like rain onto the sea
As it wind-whipped foams
Warlords in shining helmets
Send men screaming to their death
Clouds of black cover the sea
Day turns into night
Infinite darkness beckons me
No more sun, no more light
Ships tied stern to stern
A battle on the north sea waves
Hearts of braves brightly burn
Berserks swing their metal-blades
Battle hammers hit with force
Crushing helmet covers heads
Dying men tumble over board
Foaming waves colored red
Memories invade my mind
As my harness brings me down
My body's getting cold and numb
As the ocean pulls me down
Above my head my brave friends battle
Their flashing blades rip through the air
Sending men screaming to join me
As I die in these cold north sea waves
Avenger
My pale face face glows in the light of fire
My hollow eyes see but cannot see
I stare deep into the glowing inferno
The loss I feel is breaking me
I heard their screams
Through flaming walls
Walls, I could not tear down
I could not help them
I'd been away for two full years
Only to return too late to save them
Helplessly I watched my life go up in flames
I pull the sword from the glowing fire
And hammer-beat in on the anvil
Forging it with rage and hate
I will seal my enemy's fate
I engrave the blade with magic runes
And summon Gods by sacrifice in blood
Pure blue hate shines within this sword
This magic sword will cut only once
No sword has ever been like this one
The Avenger is its name
Now my sworn enemy
Vengeance will belong to me
A year has gone by
Now my sworn enemy
It's your turn to die
It's your turn to die!
Die!
To die!
Die, die!
Die, die!
Die, die, die, die, die!
The sword cuts through his throat
His head tumbles to the ground
The headless body lays gently down
Down to sleep in a pool of blood
The Avenger has lost its shine
The magic is now drained
Dull and useless it rests in my hand
Its purpose is soon fulfilled
Now hate is gone but emptiness remains
So I turn the blade around
And run it through my stomach veins
And I fall to the ground
God, His Son And Holy Whore
Serpent tongue speaks to me
Of a man from southern land
How ancient Gods are enemies
But I don't understand
Hippocritic voice of love talks of peace and Christ
Blasphemer of Gods above
One thousand years of lies
They hold their swords to out throats
And force-feed us with faith
'Bout god, his son and holy whore
But now we retaliate
Prophets of a false believe talk with tongue of ice
Threaten us with hell beneath
Now they all shall die
Turn the blade around, put the oppressors down
Free yourselves from the chains
Of lies that hold you down
Arise to be free again
We'll fight till we have won
Priests of hippocratic love talk of peace and Christ
Power is their only goal
Now they all shall die
Turn the blade around, put the oppressors down
Mess with us and you will feel
A pain so true yet so unreal
Yeah, use your hate, uncreate
Christian state will meet its fate
God, his son and holy whore
Now you will meet your fate
Metalwrath
Wrath, hate, pain and death
The code we live by
It's in our souls
Metal is the way
We fight the world
With glowing metal
Now the falses will pay
Our fight has just begun
We're sent from hall of gold
Messengers of death
We're coming after you
You can't escape us
We'll take away your breath
See us ride for vengeance
Friends of the sun cross
We are born of steel
See us ride down
The Amon Amarth
The last sight you'll ever see
So as you stand there
Under gray-clouded skies
Abandoned by your god
You know you're gonna die
You feel a sorrow
Surrounding you
As of the nine worlds
Screaming pain you feel
Your soul vaporizes
As your hearts burst
We charge without fear
Your time has come
Your Fimbul winter's arrived
A chilling wind of ice
Whirls through your heart
Pierces your bones and spine
We are all
Gazing to the skies
We'll make the false hammer fall
And we'll make Thor arise
Our quest is done
Your creation burns
Now we return to Odin's hall
Our dragon's fly
Across the waves
As twilight begins to fall
In victory we ride
We enter the mighty doors
Of the spear-god's hall
As Ygg salutes us
We raise our beers
And drink in honor of our cause
We are all
Greeted by the Gods
We made the false hammer fall
And Thor arose in blood
Legend Of A Banished Man
Run for your lives, death has arrived
Try save your soul, run from the sound of rowing oars
Out of the mist
Breaks a dragon ship
Even more feared
Than the nail-ship "Naglfar"
A bear-coated man stands in the bow
Cold-eyed he gazes towards the shoer
The dragon's head is grim and red
All covered with blood, a gift to the mighty Gods
Warshields are raised, the Gods are praised
The people stare paralyzed with fear
The legend tells of a man that fell
From grace of his baptised king
As a banished man he fled his land
But solemnly sworn to return with holy war
But no one knows how the legend goes
'Cause no ones survived
That's gazed into his eyes
'Cause no one's returned that's met his fire
They say wolf-skinned men follow him
Berserks whose eyes burn with flames of ice
Some say mighty Thor
Guides their blades in war
They say they cannot be killed
Nor can their blood be spilled
So run for your lives
Death has arrived
The legend has come
To take the lives of the deceitful ones
Run for your lives
The death ship's arrived
There's no way you'll live
To tell of meeting his fire
Bastards of a lying breed
You've ruled us for too long
Truth to you are lies to me
And your right is so wrong
Moral preached by immoral fucks
All I feel is despise
Lie no more you fucking cunts
You tare me up inside
Your sons die from your abuse
But you're giving us the blame
The easy path's the one you choose
That road will lead to pain
You're trying to control their mind
And strip them of free will
They way you force them to go blind
Will surely get them killed
My mind is free and so is my soul
You can't put me in chains
I won't play the well-adjusted role
Or bow my head in shame
So throw your stones of guilt at me
Point your finger, Curse my name!
Your scapegoat I will never be
I won't take the blame!
Now we're on trial to serve your crime
And pay for your mistakes
There is no way we'll do the time
The chains of lies will break
Censorship can't stop our truth
We speak straight from the heart
There is nothing you can do
We'll tare your souls apart
So see us rise we're few but strong
We'll crack your fucking teeth
And feed you with your twisted tongue
Until you cannot breathe
The fury makes our eyes see red
It burns within our hearts
Soon you'll all be stone cold dead
We'll tare your souls apart!
Masters Of War
STRIKE!
Fast and hard, show no mercy for these men
The vermin of Christ, prophets of lies and their disciples
Seek them out, hunt them down
Break their spirits, crush their hearts
Not even death will set them free from this pain
CHARGE!
Ride them down as they flee from our steel
Draw their blood, make them suffer
Before they die by war-field sacrifice
Wipe them out! Burn their homes and fields
Feed the wolves with their offspring, annihilate them all!
Masters of War, torment every soul
Rape every whore that carries the cross
FIRE!
Burn them all, burn them alive
Send their souls to Deathqueen's hall
To the land of cold burning flames
Send them to the land of famine and despair
Eternally they will starve and freeze
The Sound Of Eight Hooves
He's running through the woods so black
A loyal servant of Christ
Dogs are barking down his back
He's running for his life
He came with words of love and peace
These heathens had to be saved
He thought that he could make them see
Instead he was enslaved
In captivity he spoke of god
To all he met he preached
But when his master's patience ran out
He knew he had to flee
Tears are running down his cheeks
As he sobbign realizes
That in this land his god is weak
And today he's going to die
He stumbles out onto an open field
Where an old oak tree grows
In the branches hang men of three
Dressed in preacher robes
His knees refuse to carry him on
Terror shines in his eyes
His faith in Christ is almost gone
His god's left him to die
Below the dead he says his prayers
To the god he thought was alive
When he hears a calm voice say:
"SHUT HIM UP AND HANG HIM HIGH!"
As his breath leaves his eyes open wide
A bright light comes from above
He greets this light with a smile
And thinks: "There is a God"
The sound of eight hooves reaches his ears
Comes from the heavenly light
Two wolves' howls fill his heart with fear
And he sees two ravens fly
Down from the sky a warlord rides
Like fire his one eye glows
And just before the preacher dies
He knows his god is false
Risen From The Sea 2000
Risen from the sea
The beast of hell is here
He's come to rule the earth
Kneel and obey his power
A second beast rises
Rises from the earth
Followed by an army
An army of immortals
An army of the dead
Second beast breaks from the earth
Kneel and obey his power
Fire in the rocks
Fire from the sky
Kneel and obey
Kneel or die!!
Kneel or die!!
There is wisdom with him
Who hath understanding reckon
The number of the beast for it is
A number of a man its number
Is six hundred sixty six, 666
He's risen from the sea
The beasts of hell are here
Come to rule the world
And you will be in fire
So it is written, So it has been
The beast is here, to rule the world
So it is written, So it has been
The beast is here, to rule the world
So it is written, So it has been
The beast is here, to rule the world
So it is written, So it has been
The beast is here, to rule the world
As Long As The Raven Flies
Men will fight and men will die
Wars will be lost and won
That's how it's been and still will be
Long after I'm gone
Doubting not I give my blood
So I may enter hall up high
The sky belongs to Asagods
As long as the raven flies
A Fury Divine
Death is drawing near
I know it's true but I have no fear
I know I can't escape my:
FATE! Turns it's deadly wheel
Judgement day is closing in but still I cannot feel:
REMORSE! Is for the weak
I stand silent while they speak, their accusations are all:
LIES! Spread by preaching men
I'm on trial for being who I am
And praising the Gods of my native land
I will stand firm, I refuse to kneel
The fury in me is divine
My dark grave awaits, my fate is revealed
But I'm not afraid to die
Death! The day to die is here
The sun rides high on the northern sphere
And the executioner sharpens his:
Axe! Shines in the sun
I smile when they tie me down
And hear the sound of the falling blade
Death! Sweet death, relieve me from this world
Death! Sweet death, relieve me, relieve:
So death finally came to him
The pagan man could not be turned
He faced death with a grin
Now his head rests in the dust
The proud man stood firm, he refused to kneel
Then fury in him was divine
Now he is dead, his fate has been sealed
He's brought to Golden Hall up high
Annihilation Of Hammerfest
All is lost and foreign kings
Rule the northern realms
Hammerfest, the last outpost
Has fallen to unbearded men
Lords of the bloody cross
Deceived or murdered all of true faith
Now the temple of Thor, where Mjolner is kept
Is under siege
They fear the power of Mjolner
The hammer of Thor
And all their efforts to destroy it have failed
From deep within the frozen ground
Comes a rumbling sound
Ravens fly and wild wolves howl
Sending shivers down Christians' spines
As if from nowhere
Dark and grim he appears
The warlord of the Gods comes with force
To retrieve The Crusher
The first man died with a gurgling sigh
When his head was crushed
Painful surprise in his eyes
As his life was snuffed
With raw and brutal force
The warlord breaks the temple doors
The weak back off in fear
On the altar it lies, he lifts the hammer high
And before it he swears:
`Allvise Ygg, Maktige Harjafader
Guda av Asars och vaners att
Hor mina ord, nar som jag svar
Att om tusen vintrar ater ta var ratt?
While he speaks his prayer
Mjolner rests in the air
As if holding breath
Frozen by fear
They gathered stand and stare
And what they see is death
A laughing cry fill the shivering night
He lets the hammer strike
A bolt of lightning bright
Rips the darkened sky
Fire of doom - Ignite!
The Fall Through Ginnungagap
Once I was - Now I am no more
A burst of flames threw me into oblivion
The life I knew - Seems distant and unreal
A fading dream, a memory I can't recall
Am I real - I can no longer tell
A notion tells me I still exist
Infinite dark - Through this void I float
Resting, waiting for the day
When I will live again
Eons pass or maybe I just blinked
Deeper into this hell I sink
Falling through Ginnungagap
I'm pulled towards an unseen gate
I seem to hear my name being called
I float towards these cries of fate
Faster than - the speed of light
I am falling through universe
Stars flash by - Before my eyes
The time has come to return
Out of the dark - Into the light
Back into life I am cast
By my side - A demon army rides
We ride to reclaim that once we lost
Eons have passed, I'm back from the dead
Victory lies ahead
Releasing Surtur's Fire
He's riding down 'cross a field familiar but nothing is the same
This place he knew as Hammerfest
When the old Gods reigned
The army of demons rides
By his side with weapons drawn
Today is the day
When Ragnarok will be spawned
There lies the mountain where the temple once stood
Where eons ago he arose to spill their christian blood
Stuck in the rock is a golden ring
That yet no one's dared to touch
The legend has it it's where the Crusher once struck
He pulls the hammer from the mountain's grip
The sign for demons to attack
He's been called upon to arise and he won't spare a single life
No, Thor (won't) spare a single soul, nor let them get away alive
They strike down on the world with overwhelming force
All resistance is brutally crushed, crushed without remorse
Dark angels descend to join the bloodfight
The slaughter brings them on, see Odin's Valkyries ride
The battle of Midgard is almost won
And the thousand years of tyranny will be forever gone
Soon a new world will be born rising from the Sea
Where Asagods again shall reign and humans will be free
He rides once more upon the black mountain of doom
Holding firm the Crusher of giants' bones
He lets the hammer strike, now everything will burn
As Surtur's fire is released upon the world
Eyes Of Horror
Every night I see through eyes
Of a different lunatic
And every night I fantasize
In trancial mesmeric
All alone inside my head
Within my padded cell
Ruled by thoughts of another mind
Controlled by unseen eyes
In my mind I see the sun
Plunge into the sea I listen to my
Tales now I'll tell you what I see
And so the corpses
And the thrill
My mind is warped
Nothing's real
Do I dream
Or is it true
The piercing scream
She never knew
Every night I see through eyes
Of a different lunatic
And every night I fantasize
The eyes of horrorTwilight Of The Thunder God
There comes Fenris' twin
His jaws are open wide
The serpent rises from the waves
Jormungandr twists and turns
Mighty in his wrath
The eyes are full of primal hate
Thor! Odin's son
Protector of mankind
Ride to meet your fate
Your destiny awaits
Thor! Hlödyn's son
Protector of mankind
Ride to meet your fate
Ragnarök awaits
Vingtor rise to face
The snake with hammer high
At the edge of the world
Bolts of lightning fills the air
as Mjölnir does it's work
the dreadfull serpent roars in pain
Thor! Odin's son
Protector of mankind
Ride to meet your fate
Your destiny awaits
Thor! Hlödyn's son
Protector of mankind
Ride to meet your fate
Ragnarök awaits
Mighty Thor grips the snake
Firmly by its tongue
Lifts his hammer high to strike
Soon his work is done
Vingtor sends the giant snake
Bleeding to the depth
Twilight of the thundergod
Ragnarök awaits
Twilight of the thunder god
Twilight of the thunder god
Twilight of the thunder god
Twilight of the thunder god
Thor! Odin's son
Protector of mankind
Ride to meet your fate
Your destiny awaits
Thor! Hlödyn's son
Protector of mankind
Ride to meet your fate
Ragnarök awaits
Free Will Sacrifice
See them gathered on the plains now
See an army strong and vast
As long as one of us remains here
None of them will ever pass
Here they come so raise the shields high
Like wolves they show their teeth
None of us will ever yield now
To the scavengers beneath
We're outnumbered ten to one here
Still, I love the odds
We will sacrifice them one by one
Send them off to the gods
Soon we will be gone
A free will sacrifice
As free men we are born
And free we shall die
Here they come ten thousand strong
Charging up the hill
This day will be both hard and long
They move in for the kill
Hold the line don't let it break
Use your sword and spear
A glory death, for all awaits
All who knows no fear
Hordes of men they hit the shields
Like waves they break away
We face our woven destiny
And we don't fear the grave
Soon we will be gone
A free will sacrifice
As free men we are born
And free we shall die

Where Is Your God?
The enemy has come for you
Hear the pounding thunder hooves
There's no time to run or hide
Draw the weapon from your side
When they ride out
From morning mist
With sharp blades in mighty fists
One hundred warriors on horse
An awesome brutal force
You feel weak and scared
Fear has gripped your heart
You will soon be over run
You will soon be torn apart
Now, where is your god?
Does he hear your prayers?
Does he even care for you?
His silence speaks loud and clean
Raid is done!
See the country burn
All are gone!
Only misery remains
Raid is done!
The warriors return
All are gone!
All that's left is pain
The Vikings strike
So fast and hard
Those who run won't make it far
And those who chose to stand and fight
They have made the choice to die
The weapons tear through flesh and bone
Dying men that scream and moan
With severed limbs
To the hall of death
The battlefield is full of death
Feel the stench of rotting flesh
When the entire country burns
As the warriors return
And they came out
From morning mist
With sharp blades in mighty fists
They leave this land
All burned and scorn
Those alive will mourn
Now, where is your god?
Does he hear your prayers?
Does he even care for you?
His silence speaks loud and clean
Raid is done!
See the country burn
All are gone!
Only misery remains
Raid is done!
The warriors return
All are gone!
All that's left is pain
Raid is done
See the country burn,
Only misery remains
All are gone
Warriors return,
All that's left is pain
Where's your god?
Does he hear your prayers?
Does he even care?
Where's your god?
Does he hear your prayers?
A silence loud and clear!
Varyags Of Miklagaard
Miklagaard has been our home
For twenty years or more
We've lent our axes, spears and swords
In service of the emperor
We are loyal warriors
That's the oath we gave
To protect the emperor
Even to a violent grave
Our loyalty was always firm
We kept our given word
On these southern battlefields
Our northern war cries roared
Battles have been fought
Many gave their lives
But all who died by axe and sword
Were called to hall up high
Our time here
Is now at end
Can't help but reminisce
A cold spring day
So long ago
When we set out to sea
We!
Set out from Svitjod's
Shores!
With dreams of fame and
Gold!
And!
The work of weaving
Norn's!
Was for us unknown
We were loyal warriors
That's the oath we gave
To protect the emperor
Even to the grave
It's time to take farewell
We have been resolved
From the sacred oath we gave
It's time to go back home
Out time here
Is now at end
Our memories will stay
Of Miklagaard
Our southern home
Until the end of days
We!
Set out for Svitjod's
Shores!
With honor and
Rewards!
We return back
Home!
We return back
Home!
With honor and
Rewards!
We return back
Home!
Tattered Banners And Bloody Flags
There comes Lopt, the treacherous
Lusting for revenge
He leads the legions of the dead
Towards the Aesir's realm
They march in full battle dress
With faces grim and pale
Tattered banners and bloody flags
Rusty spears and blades
Cries ring out, loud and harsh
From cracked and broken horns
Long forgotten battle cries
In strange and foreign tongues
Spear and sword clash rhythmically
Against the broken shields they beat
They bring their hate and anarchy
Onto Vigrid's battlefield
There comes Lopt, the treacherous
He stands against the gods
His army grim and ravenous
Lusting for their blood
Nowhere is longer safe
The earth moves under our feet
The great world tree Yggdrasil
Trembles to its roots
Sons of Muspel gird the field
Behind them Midgaard burns
Hrym's horde march from Nifelheim
And the Fenris wolf returns
Heimdal grips the Giallarhorn
He sounds that dreaded note
Oden rides to quest the Norns
But their web is torn
The Aesir rides out to war
With armor shining bright
Followed by the Einherjer
See Valkyries ride
Nowhere is longer safe
The earth moves under our feet
The great world tree Yggdrasil
Trembles to its roots
Sons of Muspel gird the field
Behind them Midgaard burns
Hrym's horde march from Nifelheim
And the Fenris wolf returns
No Fear For The Setting Sun
I'm out of breath
And all my muscles ache
It feels like spikes
With every step I take
My heart beats
It's about to burst
This day my luck
Turned to the worse
There's nowhere to run
Darkness is closing in
I don't fear the setting sun
Or the twilight that it brings
Dark clouds fill the sky
My fate is close at hand
Today is the day that I die
Today I make my final stand
I fought so hard
For taste of victory
The war is lost
But I refuse to kneel
I can't go back now
There is no retreat
I will fight hard for
All that I believe
I'm out of breath
And all my muscles ache
It feels like spikes
With every step I take
I can't go back now
There is no retreat
I will fight 'til death
I make my final charge
I, make my final charge
I have no fear in heart
I will no longer run
I, do not fear the dark
There's nowhere to run
Darkness is closing in
I don't fear the setting sun
Or the twilight that it brings
Dark clouds fill the sky
My fate is close at hand
Today is the day that I die
Today I make my final stand
The Hero
The blade I swing
Is black as night
Black as my soulless heart
It bears the burden
Of many lives
But I don't feel remorse
I lent my sword
To anyone
Willing to pay the price
No regrets for
What I've done
A mercenary's life
But there i was
On battleground
Until I felt the jaws of death
Cut into my flesh
Defending old and weak
But I did not retreat
Now, here I lie
In my own blood
And strangers cry for me
I'm prepared to meet the gods
I wish they'd let me be
I don't deserve
Their sympathy
I know who I am
My soul is death and misery
I am an evil man
I rest in my blood
Soon I will face the gods
Strangers cry for me
I wish they'd let me be
Show no sympathy
Shed no tears for me
I know who I am
I am an evil man
I know who I am
I am an evil man
Live For The Kill
The pack of wolves
Are closing in
Now, hear the howling beasts
They move fast
Through winter woods
And soon it's time to feast
A vicious hunt
On through the night
The prey is short of breath
They feel the sting
Of burning eyes
That's fixed upon their necks
A predator's heart
Knows no remorse
It lives for the hunt
A predator's heart
Knows no remorse
It lives for the hunt
A natural force
They show their sharp
And grinning teeth
As howls are getting higher
Sending chills
Down fleeing spines
Their blood runs hot as fire
The vicious chase
Is soon at end
They're hunted until death
They feel the pain
Of sharpening steel
That's cutting through their flesh
Fearless warriors
Feed the wolves
Now hear the howling beasts
They move fast
Through winter woods
See the grey-backs feast
A natural force
It knows no remorse
And lives for the kill
Embrace Of The Endless Ocean
I stroke the blade with my hand
the sharp edge cuts the skin
blood drips to the rain wet sand
my journey can begin
Once a slave but now I'm free
my honor is restored
once again I'll ride the seas
free at last from whip and oar
I slide the sword into the sheath
the ocean god is hailed
and as we push out to the sea
we raise the red striped sails
I've missed the breeze of my home shores
the frozen lakes and winter snow
but now my dreams start to unfold
father, I'm coming home
The storm came down without remorse
and water crashed the rails
the ship was thrown back and forth
as strong winds ripped the sails
The icy waves embrace my skin
I am going numb
The endless ocean swallows me
This will be my cold wet tomb
Won't feel the breeze of my home shore
nor see the lakes or winter snow
my hopeful dreams lie ripped and torn
father, I die aloneRising up to reek havoc on this land
A beast straight from hell with burning steel in hand
White heat, blinding lights as the molten lava flows
Total devastation as the power hammer blows
Burning anvil of steel
Cast by demons that dwell
Burning anvil of steel
Forged in the furnace of hell
Hammered down, a crushing force of weight
Razor sharp feel the metal penetrate
Grinding pain, the sparks that rip and blind
As Armageddon is brought upon mankind
Burning anvil of steel
Cast by demons that dwell
Burning anvil of steel
Forged in the furnace of hell
Burning!
Burning!
Burning anvil of steel!
Burning!
Burning!
Burning anvil of steel!
Burning anvil of steel
Cast by the demons that dwell
Burning anvil of steel
Forged in the furnace of hell
Satan Rising
In the deep and darkest forest
Night has reached its final hour
Pagans dance 'round brimstone fires
Lucifer comes to call
Evil rites are getting higher
Spinning fast hands to the sky
Unholy chants around the pyre
Heathens call, "Satan" they cry
Sacrificial rites
From the trees a blood-rain's falling
The end of all mankind
Satan stirs he's heard their calling
From the underworld
Comes the beast arising
Demons gather to behold
From the shadows Satan's rising
Snake Eyes
Life is just a lottery
No matter how you choose
But that has never bothered me
'cause I was born to lose
It doesn't matter what the cost
You know I won't give in
And I don't care about the odds
Because I play to win
You know I am a gambling man
And I have paid the price
Luck has never graced my hand
When I roll the dice
Snake eyes!
I trust the way I live my life
The choices that I make
To the rolling of the dice
No matter what's at stake
Some will call me fatalist
And some will call me freak
But hidden in my throwing fist
The fortune that I seek
You know I am a gambling man
And I have paid the price
Luck has never graced my hand
When I roll the dice
Snake eyes!
I caught your eye in a New York bar
You were looking down at me
An angel in black measuring in
At just over seven feet
Some fellas like their women short
Some fellas like 'em round
But me I like the kind of girl
That makes me stand up to go down!
Stand up! To go down!
No man will throw her around
Stand up! To go down!
When we make out I can't reach the ground
We took a cab, you got in the back
But the front seat had to come out
The car shook, the car bounced
As you ground me pound for pound
But back at your place you took the reins
And saddled up, you rode me around
And just as I reached the finish line
You made me stand up to go down!
Stand up! To go down!
No man will throw her around
Stand up! To go down!
When we make out I can't reach the ground
Stand up! To go down!
I'm going down but I'm upward bound
Stand up! To go down!
In a crowd she's easily found
Stand up! To go down!
No man is gonna throw her around
Stand up! To go down!
When we make out I can't reach the ground
The wait is soon at end
Always charge, never bend
Morning is here, make your stand
Live for honor, glory, death in fire!
Total war is here
Face it without fear
Age of sword, age of spear
Fight for honor, glory, death in fire!
See the fire rise
Flames are raging high
Soon all will burn and die
Burn for honor, glory, death in fire!
Storm of lethal flames
Only death remains
Ragnarok is closing in
Die for honor, glory, death in fire!
Forces of chaos is on the move
Everyone, choose your side
And know the end is coming soon
The day for all to die
The day is here when Bifrost breaks
Nor sun or moon will rise
When the dead rise from their graves
And Surtur spreads his fire
All you know will wither away
And sink into the sea
A new world will be born one day
Where everyone is free
Total war is here,
Face it without fear
Age of sword, age of spear
Fight for honor, glory, death in fire!
Storm of lethal flames
Only death remains
Ragnarok is our fate
Die for honor, die for glory
Die, death in fire!
For The Stabwounds In Our Backs
Silently we bide our time
Soon we'll pay you back
For all the wrongs you've done our kind
For the stabwounds in our backs
You think you're safe. Well, live your lie
There's no way you'll escape
The day that all things living die
The day we rise again
Then Fenris' father will summon us
And we will rise from the death
One million warriors with foaming mouths
To challenge life itself
A horrid ship of dead men's nails
Will bring our ranks ashore
The eastern wind will fill our sails
And your son will hold the oar
You think you're safe. Well, live your lie
There's no way you'll escape
The day that all things living die
The day we rise again
Our rusty swords will never rest
So send the best you've got
Into our grinning jaws of death
We'll make their suffering short
So sit there on your golden throne
Soon we will arise
Time for vengeance is coming soon
The time for all to die!
Where Silent Gods Stand Guard
The last head falls to the ground
No one is left alive
They thought that they could take me down
But it's not my time to die
I wipe the blood from my sword
And slide it in my belt
This is the sweetest of rewards
The best rush I have felt
Ten men are dead by my feet
I smell their streaming blood
And I smile, cause it makes me...
...makes me feel so good
They were crawling on their knees
Begging for their pathetic lives
Now their souls belong to me
As well as their eyes
Each man has something that I crave
I eat their steaming eyes
And drink their blood to make them my slaves
At Oden's feat in afterlife
I bring the skulls to my shrine
Where silent Gods stand guard
Soak them in blood and in wine - A sacrificial ritual
One thousand heads are on display
Collected through years of thirst
Macabre trophies from my prey
Picked clean of flesh by Oden's birds
I am - I am - A wolf in human shape
I am - I am - A predator with flaming rage
I'm a wolf in human shape - Every man is prey
A predator with flaming rage - Blood is in my trace
I will die with sword in hand
And then my seat's secured
When Oden calls from golden hall
He will greet me at the door
Vs The World
One we were scum of the Earth
Now we've cleared our names
In Nifelheim came rebirth
Baptized in Mount Doom's flames
A decade now we've fought this war
Never yielding from our path
Our journeys take us to foreign shores
Where we let our metal blast
We've been battered and left for dead
We've been beaten and we have bled
But we always made it through - Vs the world
This may be our last quest
Before we're put to rest
The end is coming soon - Vs the world
Warriors of the grave took us south
Hell bent on genocide
They made us face the brutal truth
This would be no easy ride
Grotesque creatures of the sky
Met with us on winter fields
Christian god cast aside - Massacre of hallowed eve
We've been battered and left for dead
We've been beaten and we have bled
But we always made it through - Vs the world
This may be our last quest
Before we're put to rest
The end is coming soon - Vs the world
Persian demons brought us south
On merciless campaign
We've raided the western shores
Always going against the grain
All these years we've fought to win
And sometimes almost died
I tell you now we won't give in
Without a vicious fight
We've been battered and left for dead
We've been beaten and we have bled
Versus the world
Across The Rainbow Bridge
My days are numbered: soon I have to leave
The Norns have stretched my living thread
The notion of my demise won't leave me be
Why cannot death just set me free!
I've lived a life or prosperity
But I'm not as young as I used to be
Down the road waits misery
Why cannot death just set me free!
Countless armies have I attacked
Not once have I backed down
And though I've spilled a lot of blood
I never once received a mortal wound
I've raided shores in many lands
I cannot count the men I've killed
So many friends died with sword in hand
But the warrior's death was never granted me
I dress myself in battle clothes
Alone I make the final ride
My sight is blurred, by whipping snow
I seek to end my life
I want to walk across the Rainbow Bridge
And see my fathers in the golden hall
They beckon me to join their feast
In my dreams I hear their call
Down The Slopes Of Death
Down the slopes of death he rides
The eight hooves pound like drums
Darkness reigns the crumbling sky
Invasion has begun
Fields of flames greets his eye
He smells the fear and pain
Of dying men in agony
It can drive a man insane
All enemies flee his spear
No bow nor axe do harm
Allfather rides out on fields of fear
When Heimdal sounds the alarm
But on the field waits his fate
Foretold in ancient times
A beast with sharp yellow teeth
And hateful burning yes
Today he'll draw his final breath
The wisest God of all
His son will avenge his death
Iormundr's brother will fall
He knows now what is to come
No use to try and run
What is to be, let it be done!
What is to be, let it be done!
Today he'll draw his final breath
The wisest God of all
His son will avenge his death
Iormundr's brother will fall
Down the slopes of death he rides
The eight hooves pound like drums
Darkness reigns the crumbling sky
Invasion has begun
Down the slopes of death he rides
The eight hooves pound like drums
Darkness reigns the crumbling sky
No more is the sun
Thousand Years Of Oppression
He hung on the windswept world tree
Whose roots no one knows
For nine whole days he hung there pierced
By Gugnir, his spear
Swimming in pain he peered into the depths
And cried out in agony
Reaching out he grasped the runes
Before falling back from the abyss
He gave himself unto himself
In a world of sheering pain
So that we all may live our lives
By the wisdom that he gained
You doubted him, and spread their lies
Across the world, with sword in hand
You raped our souls, and stole our right
All for the words of mild-mannered man
You listened to mild-mannered god
And put your faith in deceitful words
Your powertrip was paid by blood
In kindness' name you spilled our blood
I refuse to submit
To the god you say is kind
I know what's right, and it is time
It's time to fight, and free our minds
Let me die without fear!
As I have lived without it
So shut your mouth and spare my ears
I'm fed up with all your bullshit
After a thousand years of oppression
Let the berserks rise again
Let the world hear these words once more:
"Save us, oh lord, from the wrath of the Norseman"
Our spirits were forged in snow and ice
To bend like steel forged over fire
We were not made to bend like reed
Or turn the other cheek
He grasped the runes, they're ours to use
Bloodshed
Midgard's cold and hatred reigns
Hunger and disease
Fenris is set free again
Chaos is unleashed
The storm of death sweeps the shores
Famine sweep the land
Ties of kinship is no more
Sons die by their father's hand
Two men meet on battleground
Their eyes are full of hate
By sacred oaths both are bound
Death will be their fate
They share the blood of once proud men
Yet foes they have become
One fights for truth, the other for faith
Perish has begun
Here comes the - Bloodshed
It's the age of - Bloodshed
Here comes the - Bloodshed
It's the age of - Bloodshed
Two brothers meet in battle heat
Both will die to day
No victory and no defeat
Death is their only way
In their eyes is no remorse
They make their final charge
Thrusting their swords with mortal force
Piercing each other's hearts
Here comes the - Bloodshed
It's the age of - Bloodshed
Here comes the - Bloodshed
Prepare for - Bloodshed
...And Soon The World Will Cease To Be
The Northern wind brings snow and ice
Humans starve and freeze
The Fimbul winter has arrived
And soon the world will cease to be
Brother will be brother's bane
No one shall be spared
All will die. None remain
That is mankind's share
The southern sphere is set ablaze
Muspel's fire is set free
The sun is on its final chase
And soon the world will cease to be
Across the western sky he runs
A wolf so grim and mean
Devours the eternal sun
And soon the world will cease to be
The North Star falls from the sky
Into the deep cold sea
The first of all to fall and die
And soon the world will cease to be
Muspel's flames lick the sky
Hidhægg eats the dead
The Aesir meet in hall up high
And Oden 'quests Mimer's head
Land is swallowed by the waves
Rocks and mountains break
Dead men on the path to Hell
And Yggdrasil quakes
From the East comes a ship
Loke holds the oar
A demon army with swords that rip
Will join the final war
The army of the dead arrives
Heimdal blows his horn
Calling Gods out to die
Before the world can be reborn
Siegreicher Marsch (Victorious March)
Zehn schwere Stiefel
ber Grund blutgetränkt
Im Gleichschritt marschieren
Diese fìnf Krieger
Es ist Ihnen gleich
Wie sehr Ihre Wunden
Von feindlichen Schwertern geschlagen
Bis auf die Knochen schmerzen
Die herbeigesehnte Rache
Begangen in Blut
Keine Gnade gezeigt
Keine Gnade gezeigt
Den Schmerz verleugnend
Der wie ein Hammer pocht
Erlitten durch Stìrze
Von erschlagenen Pferden
Kein Anschein von Schwäche
Noch Behutsamkeit
Nicht einmal ein Funke
Von Reue in Ihren Augen
Sie erschlugen die Männer
Nährten Wölfe mit Fleisch
Und jetzt verlassen Sie
Dieses Land Seite an Seite
Jetzt auf dem Heimweg
Fìnf Krieger die ohne Reue kämpften
Diese Geschichte von fìnf tapferen Männern
Wird ewiglich erzählt werden
Nur das Leid bleibt
Nur den Frauen allein
Die Kinder wehklagen
Von nun an lebend in Furcht
Kein Mann bleibt verschont
Kein Haus kein Hof verblieb
Keine Christin ungeschändet
Ihre Kirche von Flammen verzehrt
Rot scheint Ihr Stahl
Von Feindesblut
Erzählend vom Sieg
Der von den Göttern geschenkt
Als Sie wiederkehren
Blutend doch stolz
Brennt der Horizont
Und das Lied erklingt laut
Ten heavy feet
Walks the bloodsoiled ground
With rhythm these
Five warriors march
No matter how much
The bleeding wounds
From enemy swordcuts
Hurts to the bone
The revenge they sought
Was taken in blood
No mercy was showed
No mercy was showed
They ignore the pain
That hammerlike pounds
From falls, off slain
Horses, to the ground
No signs of weakness
No signs of weariness
Not even a glimce
Of remorse in their eyes
They slew men ruthless
Fed the wolves with flesh
And now they leave
This land side by side
Now they're headed home
Five swordsmen who fought repentlessly
Their story will be told
Of five brave men endlessly
All sorrow is left
For the woman to bare
The children cries
They live in fear
No man was spread
No houses or farm remains
No christian woman unraped
Their church consumed by flames
Their steel shines red
With enemy blood
It sings of victory
Granted by the Gods
And as they return
Bleeding but proud
The horizon burns
And the song is ringing loudBlood gushes from the wound
The cut is wide and deep
And before I turn around
He falls to his knees
A clear song rings in the blade
When steel meets hardened steel.
I hear the sound of wood that breaks,
A swords cuts through my shield.
I drop the shield and grab my axe,
A weapon in each fist.
The first blow makes the helmet crack,
The axe cut to the teeth.
I rip the axe from the head,
covered in blood and brains.
Leave the body lying dead,
Ready to strike again.
My sword cuts through clothes and skin,
Like a hot knife cuts through snow.
I smile as the bastard screams,
when I twist my sword.
Sword in my hand,
Axe on my side.
Valhall awaits,
Soon I will die.
Sword in my hand,
Axe on my side.
Valhall awaits me,
When I die.
Bear skin on my back,
Wolf jaw on my head.
Valhall awaits me
When I'm dead.
I raise my axe above my head,
My eyes stare in furious rage.
Yet more blood will be shed,
This is a victorious day!
Blood gushes from the wound,
The cut is wide and deep.
As I turn around,
I fall to my knees.
Sword in my hand,
Axe on my side.
Valhall awaits,
Soon I will die.
Sword in my hand,
Axe on my side.
Valhall awaits me,
When I die.
Bear skin on my back,
Wolf jaw on my head.
Valhall awaits me
When I'm dead.
Runes To My Memory
We rode the rivers of the Eastern trail,
Deep in the land of the Rus'.
Following the wind in our sails,
And the rhythm of the oars.
No shelter in this hostile land,
Constantly on guard.
Ready to fight and defend
Our ship 'til the bitter end.
We came under attack,
I received a deadly wound.
A spear was forced into my back
Still I fought on.
When I am dead,
Lay me in a mound.
Raise a stone for all to see
Runes carved to my memory
Now here I lay on the river bank
A long, long way from home
Life is pouring out of me
Soon I will be gone.
I tilt my head to the side
And think of those back home
I see the river rushing by
Like blood runs from my wound.
Here I lie on wet sand,
I will not make it home.
I clinch my sword in my hand,
Say farewell to those I love.
When I am dead,
Lay me in a mound.
Place my weapons by my side
For the journey to Hall up high
When I am dead,
Lay me in a mound.
Raise a stone for all to see
Runes carved to my memory
Asator
Thunder rolls across the plains,
Thor rides in pouring rain.
He rides to Jotumheim to fight
Lightning strikes when Mjölner bites.
Fire! Burning in his eyes
Fire! His hate is pure, see the lightning strike
Fire! Burning in his eyes
Fire! His hate is pure, see the lightning strike
Lightning cracks the blackened sky,
Hear the thunder chariot ride
All brave men with hearts of war
Ride the path of mighty Thor
Son of thunder!
Lighting strikes
Son of thunder!
Son of thunder!
Thor Arise!
Son of thunder!
Son Of Oden
Thundergod
Master of War
Asator!
Fire! Burning in his eyes
Fire! His hate is pure, see the lightning strike
Fire! Burning in his eyes
Fire! His hate is pure, see the lightning strike
Hermod's Ride To Hel - Lokes Treachery Part 1
Ride Sleipner
Ride for all you're worth
Faster then lightning,
To the dark realms of the world
Through valleys of darkness
On our way to Nifelheim
To the halls of Hel
Where my brother waits
Wailing voices on the wind
Urging me to turn
Distant tortured screams
Cold blue fires burn
I hear the sound of river Gjoll
Running cold and deep
It's a golden bridge shines in the dark
The bridge that Modgud keeps
Over the bridge, on through the night
Hel is getting near
There are the gates, towering high
Afflicting me with fear
In her hall, at the honor seat
My brother sits in pain
Pale and tortured Balder greats
Bound by invisible frozen chains
I have come, to bring him back with me
The whole world mourns his death!
Please set Balder free
Give him back his breath!
If it's true, what you say to me
That the whole world mourns his death.
If the whole world will weep I'll give him back his breath!
Gods Of War Arise
Darkness flees the rising sun
The village lies ahead
It will wake to a new day soon
Soon they all be dead
We came in cover of moonless night
Fifty man at arms
Now at first morning light,
The church bell sound the alarm
Sacrifice to Gods of old
Bleed them of their lives
Fresh blood on our swords
Gods Of War Arise!
Sacrifice to Gods of old
Bleed them of their lives
Fresh blood on our swords
Gods Of War Arise!
Hear the tortured screams
Shattering the air
They awake the soothing dreams
Into their worst nightmare
Fire sweeps their homes
They feel the dragons breath
Consuming and destructive flames
Agonising death
Some seek shelter in the church
A refuge for those with faith
But we know how to smoke them out
A pyre will be raised
But those who choose to stand and fight
Will die with dignity
For the unfortunate few who survive
Waits a life in slavery
The day draws to an end
The night comes dark and cold
We return to our ships
With silver, slaves and gold
We gave them agony, as they fell and die
The gods have granted victory
For our sacrifice
The day draws to an end
The night comes dark and cold
We return to our ships
With silver, slaves and gold
We gave them agony
As they fell and die
The Gods have granted victory
For our sacrifice
With Oden On Our Side
Finally the storm arrives
Out wait is at an end
Under dark winter skies
We make our final stand
For each of us, there are four of them
It matters not to us
We won't leave this field in shame
We are here to crush!
Futile to resist
You know why we have come
Futile to resist
The battle is already won!
Our hearts are full of pounding rage
Our mind hard as steel
Right before the dying day
We will have you kneel
The snow turns red from all the blood
Severed limbs and heads
A sacrifice to one-eyed God
He will claim the dead!
Under the winter skies
We stand glorious!
And with Oden on our side
We are victorious!
No retreat, no remorse
Victory will be ours
Blood on steel, sacrifice
Victory will be ours
Under the winter skies
We stand glorious!
And with Oden on our side
We are victorious!
Futile to resist
You know why we have come
Futile to resist
The battle is already won!
Cry Of The Black Birds
Raise your swords up high!
See the black birds fly!
Let them hear your rage!
Show no fear!
Attack!
Charge your horses across the fields
Together we ride into destiny
Have no fear of death, when it's your time
Oden will bring us home when we die!
The ground trembles under us
As we make our thunder charge
The pounding hooves strikes blinding fear
Into their heart
Our helmets shine in the sun
As we near their wall of shields
Some of them turn and run
When they hear our frenzied screams
Draw your swords to strike
Hear the Black Birds cry!
Let them feel your hate!
Show no fear!
(Attack! Attack! Attack! Attack!)
Charge your horses across the fields
Together we ride into destiny
Have no fear of death, when it's your time
Oden will bring us home when we die!
The enemies are in disarray
Ride them down as they run
Send them to their violent graves,
Don't spare anyone
Dead and wounded lie all around,
See the pain in their eyes
Over the field an eerie sound,
As we hear the ravens' cry
Under The Northern Star
The icy winter is creeping near
Dark skies above us
Biting frost in the air
Darkness surrounds us
The cold piercing autumn breeze
Fills the longships sail
Soon the lakes and seas will freeze
And snow will lay its veil
Many years we've been away
Many oceans we have roamed
Now the North star guides us on our way
As we are heading home
The many hardships we've endured
Have brought us rich reward
Now the North star guides us home
With cargo full of gold
Many friends died on the way
Only few of us survived
But I would gladly take their place
In Odens hall up high
The icy winter is creeping near
Dark skies above us
Biting frost in the air
Darkness surrounds us
Soon the lakes and seas will freeze
And snow will lay its veil
And we will long for the summer breeze
Where we can set our sails
Prediction Of Warfare
Ships were prepared
Weapons and shields
Sails were raised
We headed out to sea!
Norway disappeared in the east
Our journey had begun
Helpful winds gave us our speed
Under a warming sun
Heading to the emerald land
A fleet of ships
An army of two thousand men lead by the king
On the horizon dark clouds arose
Thor rode across the black clouds
As the night rolled in over us
We felt the wrath of the storm
That night I was haunted by dreams
An omen, of what was to come
The serpent arose from the sea
Ready to strike
With hammer in hand
The serpent in pain,
twisting in furious rage!
Fought for its life
The serpent escaped
Thor was in rage
My dreams began to fade
Woke from dreams
Sword in my hand
The break of dawn
We were closing in on Irish land
Time to attack
Grabbed our shields
We came ashore
And saw the waiting horde
The fight was short and deadly intense
The Irish fought us well
But as we gained the upperhand
Their fighting spirit quelled
Ready to strike
With swords in our hands
They struggle with heart
The Irish fell to our wrath
Fought for his life
Their king escaped
With fury divine
King Olaf threw his sword
Where Silent Gods Stand Guard (Live At Wacken)
The last head falls to the ground
No one is left alive
They thought that they could take me down
But it's not my time to die
I wipe the blood from my sword
And slide it in my belt
This is the sweetest of rewards
The best rush I have felt
Ten men are dead by my feet
I smell their streaming blood
And I smile, cause it makes me...
...makes me feel so good
They were crawling on their knees
Begging for their pathetic lives
Now their souls belong to me
As well as their eyes
Each man has something that I crave
I eat their steaming eyes
And drink their blood to make them my slaves
At Oden's feat in afterlife
I bring the skulls to my shrine
Where silent Gods stand guard
Soak them in blood and in wine - A sacrificial ritual
One thousand heads are on display
Collected through years of thirst
Macabre trophies from my prey
Picked clean of flesh by Oden's birds
I am - I am - A wolf in human shape
I am - I am - A predator with flaming rage
I'm a wolf in human shape - Every man is prey
A predator with flaming rage - Blood is in my trace
I will die with sword in hand
And then my seat's secured
When Oden calls from golden hall
He will greet me at the door
Death In Fire (Live At Wacken)
The wait is soon at end
Always charge never bend
Morning is here, make your stand
Live for honor, glory, death in fire!
Total war is here
Face it without fear
Age of sword, age of spear
Fight for honor, glory, death in fire!
See the fire rise
Flames are raging high
Soon all will burn and die
Burn for honor, glory, death in fire!
Storm of lethal flames
Only death remains
Ragnarok is closing in
Die for honor, glory, death in fire!
Forces of chaos is on the move
Everyone, choose your side
And know the end is coming soon
The day for all to die
The day is here when Bifrost breaks
Nor sun or moon will rise
When the dead rise from their graves
and Surtur spreads his fire
All you know will wither away
And sink into the sea
A new world will be born one day
Where everyone is free
Total war is here, face it without fear
Age of sword, age of spear
Fight for honor, glory, death in fire!
Storm of lethal flames
Only death remains - Ragnar?k is our fate
Die for honor, die for glory
Die, death in fire!
With Oden On Our Side (Demo)
Finally the storm arrives
Out wait is at an end
Under dark winter skies
We make our final stand
For each of us, there are four of them
It matters not to us
We won't leave this field in shame
We are here to crush!
Futile to resist
You know why we have come
Futile to resist
The battle is already won!
Our hearts are full of pounding rage
Our mind hard as steel
Right before the dying day
We will have you kneel
The snow turns red from all the blood
Severed limbs and heads
A sacrifice to one-eyed God
He will claim the dead!
Under the winter skies
We stand glorious!
And with Oden on our side
We are victorious!
No retreat, no remorse
Victory will be ours
Blood on steel, sacrifice
Victory will be ours
Under the winter skies
We stand glorious!
And with Oden on our side
We are victorious!
Futile to resist
You know why we have come
Futile to resist
The battle is already won!
Hermod's Ride To Hel - Lokes Treachery Part 1 (Demo)
thunder ride
make your time
ride for all you have
the enemy of mortal men
No time to loose
Eternal time above me
evil in the dark
as they ride to neiflheim
to bring their brother back
wailing voices haggle the wind
begging me to turn
distant tortured voices scream
cold blue fires burn
I hear the sound of river Gjoll
running cold and deep
its golden bridge burns in the dark
the bridge that Modgud keeps
over the bridge
on through the night
Hel is getting near
there are the gates towering high
I'm broken without fear
in her hall at the honor seat
my brother sits in gloom
pale and tortured baulder greets
bearing a face of doom
Oh!!!!!!
I have come to bring him back with me
the whole mourns his death
we beg of you
set baulder free
give him
back his breath
if its true
what you say to me
that the whole world mourns his death
then ill take in the whole worlds whim
I will give him back his breath
Once Sent From The Golden Hall (Sunlight Recording)
Rumbling thunder cracks the sky
And rain starts pouring down
Lightning strikes a cold bright light
Upon the blooddrenched ground
The sword play is hard
And many fall
Steel bites sharp in flesh
And upon a mountain
Towering tall
Stand the messengers of death
Five horsemen in armour bright
Waiting in the flashing light
Looking down upon the field
Where Vikings fight with axe and shield
On stallions black as night
With eyes burning red
They ride with thunder to the fight
Deliverance of certain death
A warcry loud as Heimdall's horn
Echoes across the land
Enemies who hear it freeze to the bone
Friends of doom proudly stand
They ride faster than the wind
With lightning speed they strike
Black ravens follow where they've been
To feed from those who died
With power they wield their swords
As they ride down fleeing men
Sending them to Hel's dark court
To never come back again
The warriors ride once more
To the mountain from which they came
Once sent by the gods to war
And they never return in shameVengeance Descending
I've found a way back to my home at last
A way that has been locked and cloaked until now
It's time to take care of my programmed past,
find the answers, and then finally fulfil my vow
I've learned from my ship's secret files
that they planned my unwanted exile!
I knew too much about their insane plan
I had to leave, from the Earth I was banned
For years I have travelled in the dark and endless space,
cast out from the human race
For vengeance I'm yearning now as I'm returning
to make my wrongdoers pay for my lonely days
Revenge!
Imperfect data I got from below,
but I've learned enough from my unknown friend
They sent me away so their empire could grow
On Terra my vengeance shall descend
I'm burning of hatred and rage,
for their lies and my time lost in space
I'll end the Interstellar War,
and disclose their plans of the human race
Revenge will be mine!
Highland Revenge
A wind of hatred is blowing across the field
I am the voice of the Clans
The leader of the Highlands
and we have come here for blood and victory
Before my army I speak the great words of war...
Brothers, they may take our lives
but they'll never take away our freedom
Scotland! I hear you call my name,
now as we ride towards our aim
England! I damn you as I cry...
Pay for the blood on the Highlands and die!
You took my father's life
You raped and killed my wife
In God's name I swear I'll get my revenge
The great rebellion I bring
will slay you and your foul king
I am the legend, the brave, the proud, your fate
The last words are spoken, now hear them roar in the wind...
Brothers, they may take our lives
but they'll never take away our freedom
We may loose the battle 
We may loose some men
But still we have showed the world
that no one can take away our freedom
Child Of Rock
A little child has changed our world
A light in the dark, a miracle
Forevermore her spirit will illuminate our lives
With open arms and open minds
we make her one of our kind
In unity we now welcome her with our song
Spread your wings and fly, we will take you high
Child of Rock
You were born and bound to the Heavy sound
Child of Rock
Trust us when we say... Take the Metal way!
Life is too short to throw away
Don't waste no time, live here and today
There may be tears along the way, but we'll be here for you
There is no right, there is no wrong
What you will need is in our song
The Only Rule is all for one and one for all
When we're dead and gone
you'll have to carry on
Show them that you're strong
and always remember our song
Oh, oh, child you were born to rock
Oh, oh, child you were born to rock
Oh, oh, child you were born to rock
Oh, oh, child you were born to rock
We were all born to rock!
Mr. Failure
You think you're Messiah supreme,
'cause you write in a magazine
But what's coming out of your head
makes me wonder if your brain is dead
You think everyone is a star
just because they got a guitar
Our music is not made for you,
'cause 'bout Metal you don't have a clue
You live your life just to criticize,
and sneak around to spread your lies
Among the fools from the MTV
you create a false reality
Hey Mr. Failure, face it
We don't wanna read your bullshit
Your words are fake, we want 'em no more
You're a wannabe to the core
Hey Mr. Failure, silence
Because what you say is nonsense
Now take this as a rule
you damn pathetic fool
Oh Mr. Failure, you can't see what it's about
We've had enough, get out!
and leave our ground once and for all
You're greasing the media machine,
with vicious rumours of our scene
You bring our band to your mill,
and you grind us just for the thrill
The sick brain of yours never rest,
always plan for what you do best...
Oppress, provoke, irritate,
ridicule, humiliate
You say you do not like our sound,
but we do not care, just leave our ground
Heavy Metal is what we play
no matter what you say
Now hear our song and obey
Dream Chaser
Across a hot and desert land
Against the wind of dust and sand
Reality seems so far away
Under the burning mortal sun
I find myself, the lonely one
A stranger rushing blindly through the day
Burning Horizon you are calling me
Burning Horizon you will set me free
Once a hero, now a shade
Chasing dreams that slowly fade
On the endless road to nowhere I ride
Once a proud man, now a ghost
In search of peace from coast to coast
From my dark and empty life I can not hide
Don't know how many years have past,
or how long this journey will last
Tomorrow seems so far far away
I am a madman on the run
Yes, a lost forgotten son
All I know's that I can not stay
Memories of pain hunt me everyday
They're driving me insane.
I can't find a way out of this hell
Someone please tell. Why did it all go wrong?
And tell me where, just where do I belong?
Let me find a place to stay
The Wizard's Apprentice
The look of disbelief is still in your face
as I watch how your eyes begin to glaze
Your broken body lies in a growing pool
of blood... I have betrayed you, you sorry old fool
But to have your Art makes it worth this crime,
and your former knowledge will soon be mine
In my hands I now hold your Grand Grimoire,
the source of your once great might and arcane lore
How many times have I not cursed these pages?
It feels like I've been reading for ages
But I can not give up, I have to be patient
'cause your book contains the Art of the Ancient
Soon your magic will lie in my hands
Every spell, powerful and grand,
of the greatest Art are going to be known to me
And then, my friend, I will no longer be...
the wizard's apprentice
I have found the key. How could I be so blind?
With the right phrase and the right state of mind
the power explodes in me, burning deep inside
The Art engulfs me in a roaring magic tide
For how many years have I not yearned and craved for this?
It feels like I have reached eternal bliss
And it does not matter much that my soul is stained
by your death, compared to what I have gained
Now your magic lies in my hands
Every spell, powerful and grand,
of the greatest Art are now finally known to me
And no more, my friend, will I ever be...
the wizard's apprentice
I am divine, pure energy
The Ancient's power flows in me
But it's to much for my mind to sustain
With a sudden burst of pain
all magic's scorched from my brain,
and I realise that all have been in vain
My Art is forever gone!
Solo Nyberg, Dahl
So now my magic's no more
My Art is gone, my precious lore
has forever been burned away from my very core
And now I am neither the Master Mage nor
the wizard's apprentice
Just a common man

The Beast In Velvet
It's the birthday of the Emperor
The cream of the realm is here,
kings and queens with sons and daughters
It's truly a most grandiose ball,
nobles fill the halls
Like sheep, ready for slaughter
Oh, with rising hate I watch them dance,
I watch them prance
Oh, how I loathe these haughty swine
I'll rid the world of this living grime
Peasants are saying, oh not without glee,
there's an aristocrat out on a killing spree
A noble, thirsty for royal blood they say
The Beast in Velvet I'm called by my prey
Though my fee is great indeed
I'd do this for free,
'cause I enjoy my work immensely
With wit and grace I charm these fools
who think they're out of harm's way
None here's aware of my sins
But then again, who'd suspect a highborn prince?
It's been so easy to lure my prey,
so to my Lord I gratefully pray
as my victim dies by my blade
Shape shifting is a useful trick in my dark trade
Heart Of The Mountain
There's a mountain by the northern sea
High and mighty like an endless tower
A tempting and majestic sight
with a treacherous secret
There's a legend 'bout its mystery
and it speaks about a tremendous power
A creation of the Gods
and a gate to Heaven
At night you see the light that will invite
the fearless to the summit
Climb and you will find yourself behind
the walls of ancient stone
Lost souls in the mountain's grave
Not dead or alive, just forgotten
Trapped in the adventurers' cave
All condemned to languish in darkness,
silence and madness
Forever paying the price
in the heart of the mountain
In a dream you saw the land of gold,
as the mountain tempted in a vision
Where the angels spread their wings
there's where you'll find your freedom
To the glorious dream your soul was sold
To find the house of God became your mission
So you left your past behind,
and now you're heading for the sky
By the light at the summit
you are turned to stone
Oblivion In The Visionary World
When darkness enters my life, 
that's when you arise
Slowly crawling into my mind
from the other side
In a callous realm, I'm captured,
completely paralysed
Through your eyes I see the real world,
where love and hate have died
I'm terrified, but somehow I have always known
We are nothing but wandering spirits in an endless void
On the edge of time I face my destiny,
and find myself within a false reality
Was my life a lie inside an evil whirl?
Oblivion reign within the Visionary World,
forever
Lifeless, impassive and alone
Dreaming a dream that's not my own
Am I alive or dead?
When did they conquer our kind?
Why did they take control of our minds?
My past is erased and gone
I'm lost in a cage
Created in the age of silence and illusions
Ride The Rainbow
Beneath the blackened sky
when the diamonds glow
you taste the moonlight in solitude
Far away from life's eternal decay
The wheel of time aches in your restless heart
The haunting inner voice of freedom won't let you go
Long years of torment and never left alone
You seek a place where the cold winds don't blow
In your own sanctuary from life. Yes!
Strangers and lies fade in your mind
On the edge of midnight
Ride the rainbow. Aim for the sky
Tame the starlight and you will fly
Ride the rainbow. Let your kingdom come
Claim the night. You're the chosen one
Ride the rainbow. Ride forever
Find the gate to your dreams. Ride the rainbow
So pure and innocent
in your bleeding eyes
The perfect darkness relieve the pain
Yet the wounds of war and violence remain
Respect and orders, a never ending tale
You seek a haven from duties and chains
Aaaah - Take my words and find your kingdom
Aaaah - Take my words and find your kingdom
Aaaah
Aaaah - Take my words and find your kingdom now!
The Fire Of Hades
Long ago I saw tomorrow drift away
like a whirlwind on the ocean
Left alone to walk the island of decay
like a blind man led to nowhere
I let it go, I let it go
After all I've found a way
from the hammer of the Gods
to the power of the dark
And the road goes on and on
I'm coming for the fire of Hades
My eternal paradise
I'm coming for the fire of Hades
Where the tempter calls my name
I surrender my soul as a final sacrifice
Over mountains roar the sound of yesterday
like a last cry of the mourner
Round and round inside the broken wheel of pain
with no light or destination
I'm coming home sailing on the last rays of the sun
I'm coming home from the empty world beyond
Hear me now I'm coming home
on the wind of silence to the flames
And the road goes on and on
And the road goes on and on and on
The Devil Inside
Are you ready?
Welcome the night. Put your worries away
Leave the sirens for a while
Enter the quiet and mysterious place
Let the silence roll the dice
A shadow never lies
We stand on the edge of the world
The gate is open wide
And out of the dark he crawls
right into your mind
Don't wait for the devil tonight
You're a midnight dreamer
Don't wait for the devil tonight
You're a midnight dreamer
The devil inside
Into the eyes of the fire he breathes
Like a whisper of your fate
Ready to strike on the hour of dreams
when the light has gone away
Don't wait for the devil tonight
You're a midnight dreamer
Don't wait for the devil tonight
You're a midnight dreamer
Don't wait for the devil tonight
You're a midnight dreamer
Don't wait for the devil
Don't wait - Don't wait for the devil
You are the devil inside
Waves Of War
On the waves of war
Far away from mortal eyes
The sign of Jolly Roger flies over the undead
Fire and water on the horizon
Is there a world beyond the sea?
We all remember the ground of the island
where we paid the price of our greed
Watching the sun fading from our eyes
When will the wind take us home?
On the waves of war
ride her ghost into the night
Condemned to carry on forever
On the waves of war
Far away from mortal eyes
The sign of Jolly Roger flies over the undead
Over the ocean like an illusion
Travel the world for land in sight
Sadly the bones shine under the moonlight
of those neither dead nor alive
Day after day trying to lift the curse
Restore the gold and pay the blood
No stormy weather in the eyes of the lost
The shadow of tomorrow is so dark
No stormy weather in the eyes of the lost
The journey onto freedom and the quest for life
control their minds
Hear the thunder roaring high
Where the everlasting chain of time awaits
One desire in the dead of the night
To the red horizon
Black Pearl sail to find the light
Dying In The Rain
By moonlight we carry the flame
but the nightfall won't take away the pain
No shadows awaits on the road
still the echo of yesterday remains
On a cold and misty journey
in the silence of the woods
we are chasing great illusions
forever in her realm
She's the lady of the twilight
and the only one who knows
When the trees of sorrow whisper
no one is alive
The eyes of tomorrow are blind
no matter how the wind cries
The sighs of the forest are loud
A sound that never ends
We sail away again
on a broken dream
We've paid the price and more
but still we are not free
We are dying in the rain
Silent dying in the rain
Look out!
Like a million tears of anger
the unspoken fly away
On the lonely road to nowhere
no words are allowed
The wise have abandoned their souls
to wander naked and cold
The proud are invisible fools
whose failure never ends
Dying in the rain
We are dying in the rain
Fighting
Countdown! The time is right
We got a final war to fight
On the road again
We're blood bound. We're dynamite
Rise up! It's do or die
There's only one way to survive
Ride against the wind
and don't stop for anyone
Lightning, thunder
They can't break our storm asunder
Aiming higher, it's here and now
Keep on fighting - Never back down or surrender
Keep on fighting - Tell the world you're alive
Keep on fighting - You were born to rock forever
Keep on fighting - There is no compromise
Breakout! It's time to burn
We've heard the call. There's no return
Leave the past behind
and fly straight into the sun
Stand proud and hold your gun
The revolution has begun
There's a world to win
so don't stop until you've won
All of the time, keeping the fight alive, all of the time
Aaaah Aaaah! Keeping the fight alive until we die
...there's no compromise
Shadow Rider
Beyond the rainbow
where the seas are burning
bells of fate and fortune toll
Heed the warning of the shadow rider
On the fields of honour the battle has begun
Men of war are claiming their rights
Fighting under banners to the bitter end
Unaware of my guarding eye
I'm the lord of the fallen
The great beholder of Life and Death
I'm the lord of the fallen
The one who follows you night and day
When your time is running out
and the angels call your name
I'll be waiting beyond the grave
Hunting at the border in the name of God
Holy knights with blood on their hands
Blinded by the promise of the afterlife
They are all welcomed to my land
Oooh Oooh I'm the shadow rider
Oooh Oooh I'm the shadow rider
Yeeeeeeah
I'm the shadow rider
and I'm coming for you
Lonely Ball Of Fate
Don't wait for your salvation to arise
The undying winter never leaves the mind
Black is the path I wander
Black are the clouds I'm under
The uncertain future echoes in the dark
Welcome to the castle of the damned
Come inside and listen to God's hymn to my life
Scarlet blood of the angels are falling down
when my shadow is dancing on the lonely ball of fate
Saddened clouds of oblivion conceal the sun
when my shadow is dancing on the lonely ball of fate
Don't look beyond the border of your life
The enchanting window always fools the eye
Bound to the never changing
sound of the raven's black wings
We all wear the thorny crown until the end
Welcome to the final masquerade
Come inside and see the abject symphony play
Learning to die from my requiem
I'm learning to die from my requiem
Learning to die from my requiem
I'm learning to die from my requiem
Guardian
Have you forgotten the end of your dream?
Are you afraid of tomorrow?
Will you remember the song of the earth
when there is no light to follow?
When the dark lord appears to embrace our mortal souls
will you then be strong and believe
or welcome the tears of rage to your eyes?
Father of shadows and father of time
You are the guardian of our lives
Father of shadows and father of time
Who will be guarding us when your eyes are closed?
Have you abandoned the path of the brave
to roam in silence forever?
Only the burden of losses remains
inside the void of your chamber
Sometimes I hear your voice
Far away, calling my name but I know
The words in the wind are my own
The Charioteer
From the plains of power
Whine the last stormy winds
For the guardian of Midgard
A final journey begins
By Odin's side
With the aesir gods behind,
A distant voice enters his mind
Lord of the sky, you're running out of time
The serpent will poison your sublime
Thunder and lightning may have dyed your blood
But you can't escape the twilight of the gods
With the hammer you have crushed
All who stood in your way
But strength and deity
Won't help you on the final day
As chaos reigns
And the Valkyries sing,
A warning is sent only for him
Lord of the sky, you're running out of time
The serpent will poison your sublime
Thunder and lightning may have dyed your blood
But you can't escape the twilight of the gods
Lord of the sky, you're running out of time
The serpent will poison your sublime
Thunder and lightning may have dyed your blood
But you can't escape the twilight of the gods
Charioteer - You're a warrior without peer
Charioteer - But your grandeur will end right here
Charioteer - Charioteer - You're a warrior without peer
Charioteer - Charioteer - But your grandeur will end right here
Confessions Of The Maker
When you think you're alone
The eyes of the world will read your mind for me
I'm the author of life
The maker of love and hate, tragedy and fate
I'm the chain, you're the slave
I'll be there from the cradle to the grave
All wars were mine, created for joy
I'm guilty of every crime
When you cry in tears I smile in delight
I am the answer to what you fear
And all that you see
My pleasure is your destiny
When you stand in the rain,
Abandoned and naked, I can not deny
My desire to plague
Well, my rules are mean, but fair and valid everywhere
I'm the wolf, you're the lamb
In my world you are forever damned
All wars were mine, created for joy
I'm guilty of every crime
When you cry in tears I smile in delight
I am the answer to what you fear
And all that you see
My pleasure is your destiny
Once you're born you'll find yourself
Placed behind the scenes of the theatre of pain
Dazed and hollow you will dwell
Until it is your turn to take part in the play of God
All wars were mine, created for joy
I'm guilty of every crime
When you cry in tears I smile in delight
I am the answer to what you fear
And all that you see
My pleasure is your destiny
Northern Rage
Restless and fierce we're approaching this unspoiled new ground
Eager to kill, feast and rape in this new land we've found
The moon is high, but no one knows
What's landed by the bay
In your town soon blood will flow
Just before the dawn of day
Warriors from the land of the midnight sun
Wield your axes for live shall none
For your gold and the slaughter
We have sailed far on stormy waters
Many coasts have been conquered and laid to rest
On our great never-ending quest
There is nothing to stop the northern rage
In this dark and violent age
At midnight we reach our target and the plundering begins
We slay every one of you as we enjoy our sins
The massacre echoes in the night, filled with grief and pain
When the last home burn in the morning light, nothing here remains
Warriors from the land of the midnight sun
Wield your axes for live shall none
For your gold and the slaughter
We have sailed far on stormy waters
Many coasts have been conquered and laid to rest
On our great never-ending quest
There is nothing to stop the northern rage
In this dark and violent age
Longing for glory
We're the masters of the sea
Anger's our story
Gold and blood are all we need
Encouraged by the Gods
Our journey shall go on forever
Warriors from the land of the midnight sun
Wield your axes for live shall none
Warriors from the land of the midnight sun
Wield your axes for live shall none
For your gold and the slaughter
We have sailed far on stormy waters
Many coasts have been conquered and laid to rest
On our great never-ending quest
There is nothing to stop the northern rage
In this dark and violent age
The Fool'S Ballet
Welcome to earth,
A circus where the clowns are in control
Welcome to life,
A state of hysteria programmed in your soul
Don't talk, don't think,
Don't feel, stay out of the way
Just be glad and grateful
For your soon ending days
We are all the chosen ones
Dressed up for God's masquerade
Without a stage and audience
We dance the fool's ballet
There's justice for all
Behind the beautiful but false facade
Here women and men,
Young and old are playing the great mortal's charade
Don't talk, don't think,
Don't feel, stay out of the way
Just be glad and grateful
For your soon ending days
We are all the chosen ones
Dressed up for God's masquerade
Without a stage and audience
We dance the fool's ballet
Almighty father, thank you for all
The fun and excitement on your great ball
No matter what you have planned for us
We'll perform until we fall
We are all the chosen ones
Dressed up for God's masquerade
Without a stage and audience
We dance the fool's ballet
The Terror
So you want to hear a tale, you say?
A true story from my younger days?
I'll try to recall, so now listen well
As I tell you about this demon from Hell
Far to the north, into the barren Wastes we went, my companions and I
To a place where the lost stronghold of king Tharngrim was said to lie
After many a peril we found it, but a shadow hung over the place
We were told of a prophecy. A demon returning one of these days
Shortly the keep was beset by a tide of Chaos, and we were pushed back
To the innermost hall, where we prepared a last stand for the final attack
Though we had fought hard and well our hopes were dead and gone,
For we all knew that the worst was yet to come
So there we stood in silence and stark fear, awaiting our fate
Then the silence ended as a tremendous force shattered the last gate
Ablaze in the darkness of the smashed gate was a pair of eyes. Like burning coal
It was violence incarnate, terrifying beyond comprehension to behold
Then it spoke with a roaring voice, and eyes shining brightly with insane bloodthirst
"I've come back, just as I promised. Well, little dwarfs, who wants to die first?"
Like a blood soaked god it came, truly the terror of its name
For the blood and souls it came, for an old debt to be claimed
As the prophecy foretold the foul demon returned
And the noble king Tharngrim painfully learned
That yesterdays glory can be turned into tomorrows doom
When he faced the Terror down in the mountain's gloom
Its axe rose and fell in great bloody arcs, turning the floor into a red lake
As it ploughed through the dwarf host and left a crimson ruin in its wake
And despite the sentinel's determination to protect their king
I witnessed the prophecy come true as the king was slain by this vile thing
Well, the story has come to an end
I hope you have enjoyed the tale, my friend
But listen to me, and listen well
They do exist, these demons from Hell
So now be sure to remember, my son,
That Chaos snare the unwary one
The unwary one
Panic
My life is a bloody mess
To my body I have no access
I know what is right, but I'm not in charge
I can't let go of the knife
That I just have raised to end your life
One more awful crime to torture my mind
Let me out. Let me out of here
I just can't take it no longer
Let me go, and leave me alone
Before I go insane
Born to run, and follow the sight
Of despair, chaos and fright
Desperate taking soul after soul
I'm out of control
In panic I am damned to live my life
My actions are not of my will,
But they seem to give my brain a thrill
I can not resist my heinous slaughter
I'm caught in a mad machine
Destruction and death are all I've seen
How can I escape this hellish nightmare?
Let me out. Let me out of here
I just can't take it no longer
Let me go, and leave me alone
Before I go insane
Born to run, and follow the sight
Of despair, chaos and fright
Desperate taking soul after soul
I'm out of control
Born to run, and follow the sight
Of despair, chaos and fright
Desperate taking soul after soul
I'm out of control
In panic I am damned to live my life
White Wolves
The day of our revenge is dawning with a chilling haze
Like the day we fell from grace
It was a shameful black day when our bravery failed
But today valour shall prevail
Under the rising sun the mist of the morning clears,
Revealing a forest of spears
A loathsome crawling mass of filth, roaring with bloodlust
Well, this time they will be crushed
Charge!
The thunder of pounding hooves below
Heralds the doom of our foes
Like thunder we descend upon our prey
For our shame they will pay
Might and honour
Now we shall restore our tarnished name and pride
Might and valour
Once again the White Company of Wolves rides
Into battle and war
With the sound of horns and the rumbling roll of drums
We attack the tainted scum
Shouting war cries like howling wolves we ride down the slope
Our hearts filled with fierce joy and hope
No more shall we have to feel the infamous bitter pain,
Or bow our heads in shame
By death or victory our honour shall be restored
So, in the name of our Lord
Charge!
The thunder of pounding hooves below
Heralds the doom of our foes
Like thunder we descend upon our prey
For our shame they will pay
Might and honour
Now we shall restore our tarnished name and pride
Might and valour
Once again the White Company of Wolves rides
Into battle and war
With fury singing in our veins
We smite our fallen leader's bane
Our hammers are smashing a gory
Path to redemption and sweet glory
Might and honour
Now we shall restore our tarnished name and pride
Might and valour
Once again the White Company of Wolves rides
Into battle and war
Into battle and war
The Burning Vision
Another day to fight for my unspoken rights
How can you say it's worth the price
You pay in a cage of lies?
Another chapter in the daily book if sin
Here I'm supposed to walk along
A path which I know is wrong
You may say I aim too high,
But I know what I have to do
I can't see the reason why
The old dream should not come true
Out of the void
Against the wind of madness
Into tomorrow I sail with my hope
No time to waste
I'm heading for the future
I'll carry on till I finally reach
My burning vision
Tired of being the prey and always hearing them say
You can not raise a family
Lost in a fantasy
Detested by the fools who never break a rule
But their eternal jealousy
Won't change my destiny
You may say I aim too high,
But I know what I have to do
I can't see the reason why
The old dream should not come true
Out of the void
Against the wind of madness
Into tomorrow I sail with my hope
No time to waste
I'm heading for the future
I'll carry on till I finally reach
My burning vision
When dreams and memories collide
I'll be leaving for the final ride
Just like the wind I'll travel across the seas
Under skies of glory I will fly, forever free
Laughing at the pain in my past
Out of the void
Against the wind of madness
Into tomorrow I sail with my hope
No time to waste
I'm heading for the future
I'll carry on till I finally reach
My burning vision
Revolution In The Shadowland
Rain - A million tears to the ground
Wind - The unmistakable sound of war
The rebellion has begun
Our freedom must be won
To the castle of tyranny we ride
Tear down the walls
Hunt the King out of his halls
Dethrone the One and we'll be in command
What ever we'll meet,
We won't surrender nor retreat
Freedom we claim to the Shadowland
No more lies. Let the crown of the tyrant fall
It's the final battle of the Shadowland
Glory days and peace are waiting for us all
It's the revolution of the Shadowland
Fight for all the painful years
When all we felt was fear
Drawn by insurrection we will prevail
Closer we come
Now we know what's to be done
The message we have for his majesty
Die tonight!
No more lies. Let the crown of the tyrant fall
It's the final battle of the Shadowland
Glory days and peace are waiting for us all
It's the revolution of the Shadowland
Rebels of the brave
Never loose your faith
Let us end it all tonight
Hold on to your hearts and fight
No more lies. Let the crown of the tyrant fall
It's the final battle of the Shadowland
Glory days and peace are waiting for us all
It's the revolution of the Shadowland
Shadowland
Shadowland
Shadowland
Terminal Voyage
A cold and endless void of glimmering bright souls I see
Drifting around our sad and mundane reality
An astral plane filled with strange harmony
Where the dead march on, through infinity
But I don't know where they go
No one's come back to tell me the truth
Have you ever wondered what's beyond
Your terrestrial life and corporal bonds?
Have you ever pondered on what's out there,
When your life is over and finished here?
The greatest mystery of all
On golden rays of light. On shining silvery beams
Ethereal beings float in beautiful glittering streams
Dancing slowly towards the unknown
To a place our Maker has shown?
Well, I don't know where they go
No one's come back to tell me the truth
Have you ever wondered what's beyond
Your terrestrial life and corporal bonds?
Have you ever pondered on what's out there,
When your life is over and finished here?
The greatest mystery of all
All these souls, like a billion fires,
Illuminate the void as life expires
But like grains of sand they are blown astray
On a terminal voyage
On a terminal voyage they sail
On a terminal voyage they sail away
Silent Angel
Lies, empty words in the wind
A tragic melody
Unwise is the one who believe in tomorrow
The shade of a loser never fades away
Until the story ends
But there is a light where I lonely stray
And the light is you my friend
Silent angel from above
Take me on your wings of love
Fly me far away from here
Show me the way to the silence
Free is the one with a name
Carved in a tombstone
Tell me, am I the one to blame for my life?
The pain is eternal when I realise,
All my thoughts were true
There's neither a Heaven nor a paradise
All I can believe is in you
Silent angel from above
Take me on your wings of love
Fly me far away from here
Show me the way to the silence
I see her face in the crowds,
The darkness and the clouds
I'll wait for her until
I find eternal tranquillity
Silent angel from above
Take me on your wings of love
Fly me far away from here
Show me the way to the silenceDeath Of Ferdia
On this bloodstained land
I will make my stand
And my honour will defend
Ferdia oh, my friend
This will be the end
When this spear will leave my hand
Fight with me!
Choose your weapon today!
Let it be all or any, today you're both brother and prey
Draw your sword!
Cast your spear to me!
Ferdia! Come face your brother
Come face the Hound of Cullan!
I care not whether I die
tomorrow or next year
If my deeds live after me
My soul dies here with you
Brother, see you
In Tir nan nOg
My spear pierces your heart, and strikes mine twice as hard
Today, there will be no victory
Yet again, my brother
My hands are covered in your blood
This time not heal your wounds
Fate wanted us to live as brothers
And die as foes
Woe onto ireann, for the greatest of warriors has fallen
Gergovia
7 times a hundred roman souls
46 centurions slain on Gergovia's hill
700 skulls to celebrate the gods
As they bless the name of Vercingetorix
The eagle spreading his wings
Has darkened our sun
Our forage destroyed
Our crop is watered in blood
Legions invincible march of Gaul
One by one tribes are paying the toll
I heard of a hero who would stop all of this
And reign over Gaul as a king
I heard of a man who will triumph over Rome
Vercingetorix
Caesar entrenched camp outside their fort
And captured a high hill from where he laid siege
Centurions advanced
To ensure the Gauls have surrendered
Legions invincible launch the attack
One by one tribes pay the toll
Oblivious of what's hidden within the walls
Gergovia the glorious had a new king
Hailing their leader the Gauls shouted loud: Vercingetorix
Caesar roared as the legions charged
Ordering to retreat - recedite!!
Blinded by blood thirst his army attacked
and ignored his command
Crying for victory marching to death
Hailing "Caesar, Caesar!" to their last breath
Days Of High Adventure
Sword at side or pen to write
Our weapon in our heart more than in our hand
To fall in the line or stand back to sing
We witnessed the glory of many heroes' end
We've marched aside the greatest of all
Whoever that is only the soul can tell
We sang for those who could never rest
The Days of High Adventure
In our chests, will never end
Aeons long gone and places unseen...
Our life is lost between what will be and what has been
Commanding a fleet or sounding a charge
Our souls will fill with ecstasy when we draw our swords
We'll never forget when we reigned on Aquilonia
Or fought aside the Albino Prince
Wear the Ring, Ride the Dragon, draw the Sword out of the Stone
And blow your last breath into the Horn!
We've always been there
We are the Riders of Doom
One fate: Sword and Shield
In Days of High Adventure
We are born to die on the battlefield
Steel Of My Axe
Horns in the distance, resound through the air
The trebuchet's shape standst tall
Attack is imminent, but I have no fear
I won't be dethroned
As in 1282, when flames reached the sky,
I am ready again to swing my axe
And sound the horn to charge the besiegers
The hunters are hunted again
I am born a king and will die a king
The blade of my axe is my witness
The deceivers' blood paved my way to the throne
Now I am here to stay!
God's fire of hate and destruction is here to kill, But I shall triumph once again by the steel of my axe!
I sharpened my blade for all these years
Waiting to take my revenge
The heads of those who tried to dethrone me
Will taste the cold steel, and then roll
I took my path, my decisions are made
I now cheer with blood in my horn
I reign my kingdom, your only choice to obey
Speak to my axe then to me
I am born a king and will die a king
The blade of my axe is my witness
Deceivers' blood paves my way to the throne
I am here to stay!
God's fire of hate and destruction is here to ki
I shall triumph once again by the steel of my axe!
I hail this land, my kingdom again
No mercy for the deceivers
Axe at my side, my reign is of steel
As of steel is my pride
Claidheamh Solais (Sword Of Light)
Through the tales
The legend lived
A Sword of Salvation
At the side of
The greatest kings
Brought Hope and Destruction
A light that shone
Of ancient strength,
Arose from the Earth
From green misty hills
To swing in frostbitten lands
Forged by the Gods
The Sword that was made for Man
Caladvwlch, bring us all to Victory!
Blade of Doom, ruler of Man's Destiny!
I chant your countless names:
Sword of Light, Sword of Doom
Caladcholg
The rainbow beam
Connacht's Defender
Caliburn
Cymric Heir
Of the best of ?ireann
A golden hilt
For a silver hand
Who ruled the first reign
Crusher of Evil
Its power will one day return
When the white lord is vanquished
The fire of our faith will burn
Caladvwlch, bring us all to victory!
Blae of Doom, ruler of Man's Destiny!
I chant your countless names:
Sword of Light, Sword of Doom
Thundercult
Upon this twisted land
And consecrated by the Gods' touch
I shall create the cult of myself
Where the sky and earth and divine fire
are one
I shall create my Thundercult
May the sensation of the Thunder
Descend onto me
I am thunder, I am divine
I am the Thundercult
May the thunder be in my hand
In my chest and my voice
May I be a living Thundercult
May the sensation of the thunder
Descend onto me
I am thunder, I am divine
I am the thundercult
This way the sentence from above
Shall manifest itself
Thus the cult was consecrated
The Throne of Thunder is mine
Luni
Head toward the island
On its shores we saw a cross
Priests of the new white god
Who want to replace our pagan faith
Approach to a silent land,
On which holy chants resound
Give them a dreadful lesson
The Raven flies over the Dove
May I die in Odin's name, the monks shall be tortured and slain
This is now land of the greatest of all
May I kill in Odin's name
No crosses and churches shall stand against our sky
Guide me Odin,
Guide me, I'll leave this land burning for you
Guide the faithful to the end.
Lay me on a board,
Bring me to the priest
Let me enter the temple
Of the White Lord of the Heavens
Let me avenge my faters
By holding this priest's head
Go forth now my warriors
And burn this town to the ground
May I die in Odin's name, the monks shall be tortured and slain
This is now land of the greatest of all
May I kill in Odin's name
No crosses and churches shall stand against our sky
Guide me Odin,
Guide me, I'll leave this land burning for you
Guide the faithful to the end
Once Glorious
At the feet of the mountains
On this hills of ancient pride
I lay my eyes on the endless lake
And still I can hear the stories that it spake...
Of a folk that tried its steel
And found death on the battlefield
Once glorious! Once mine!
These hills are no longer alive
With the spirit of this valiant Tribe
Wirdomar made the final stand
The wolf breastfed descendants
save by crying geese
thereafter shadowed this wooden land
Our valleys witnessed no kings since
the day Lugh hid in the lakes
Once glorious! Once mine!
These hills are no longer alive
With the spirit of this valiant Tribe
The Great Horn
From my infinite journey I, at last, return
To my native lands, of the ancient gods of old
Under a boulder I found the legendary great horn
The moment is here to fight for the harp of gold
Warriors
From all of the nation come to answer the call
Warriors
The moment of truth is here, the nation calls
Its magical power I will release onto the land
And summon the army at my father's command
Foes as black as bog oak and brown as wet sand
The nation arises once again, a proud last stand
Warriors
From all of the nation come to answer the call
Warriors
The moment of truth is here, the nation calls
And what I thought was destined to remain a memory
Before my eyes became splendid truth
All the heroes of the tales of old are now gathered
By the sound of the Great Horn

DOOMSWORD LYRICS
Shores Of Vinland
We were sailing towards
The unknown in the open sea
After the storm, our hope was lost
In the raging waves but
My old faith was never so strong,
My viking heart don't fear the fate!
Under Leif's christian command
Full of wild grapes was the land
To which we approached
And tried to live but no more
Hydromel was in our horns
Our viking hearts don't fear the fate!
Twice a winter, we messed our beloved.
Praying the lord,
Leif sought a blessing for our souls
Under his sign we abandoned our folks,
Now we are ready to unfurl the sails
Naglfar the ship will not have our nails,
Our viking hearts don't fear the fate!
Twice a winter we missed our beloved,
To these shores our hearts do not belong!
Our ship devours the ocean waste
The sea is the nature on which we where born
Approaching our bay resound the viking horn
The hammer triumphant,
The cross now is torn,
My viking heart still has faith!
Twice a winter, we missed our beloved
Who did enlight the way to return?
Mighty Thor bring me back home.
Onward Into Battle (On The March Again)
We chose our destiny
Fianna is the name
For which we shall live
To which our souls we give
Once again to the battle we march
Blow after blow
Swords spreading death
Witness your glory or
Your mates' last breath.
March! March!
We answer the call of the king,
From far you can hear
The army that sings
"Victory we bring!"
Lamp fires await for the dawn,
Coward would me the attack
Glory awaits when the sun
Shines bright.
March! March!
On the march
On the march again
On the march,
On the march!
The Doomsword
He walks among strangers' eyes
Hearse of his unknown presence,
The world is still confused
And the balance was changed
By the DoomSword
The dark shape will rise,
A demon at side
The DoomSword will fall
On the world
The bell of fate sounds its toll,
The DoomSword.
For the whole world will fear
The sign and the name of the lord
Who bears the DoomSword!
Resign to the blade
Which in hell was made
Your soul is safe no more
It can't be your choice:
"Bow to the sword!"
Listen to the doom
And knell to the sword,
The blade rose tall it's now ruler,
Ruler of all for the whole world will fear
The sign and the name of the lord
Who bears the DoomSword.
For I am your god and you must obey,
I am the king, war I will bring,
Follow me or be my pray,
Be my pray!
MCMXIX
If you look to the east,
On the ways of pilgrimage,
You can still see the trails,
Which they left behind.
Deserted sands on the slopes
Of what once where hills,
Hide a mystic mystery,
The quest for the holy research.
Nine knights for none years
Piercing the ground they all disappeared,
A secret plot disguised as holy quest,
Nine knights did want to disappear.
As above so below of the temple
Was the law, see the stars that shine
Upon dark shapes behind the cross
What was found has now been lost
Arcane knowledge they obtained
What they finally left be
Kind is what chosen few can see.
Nine knights for none years piercing
The ground they all disappeared
A secret plot disguised as holy quest,
Nine knights did want to disappear,
Nine knights, one might!
For Those Who Died With Sword In Hand
I look to my land this one,
The last time should be a desperate deed
I will mire my blood with sand,
The steel is now in me this cold blade
That gives me death
And all I see is the blood
From my wounds,
Blinding me,
The death which I will have
Should grant me the glory I sought
For my breed shall proclaim
How glorious was their elder one,
This is my end
I proudly mix my blood with sand...
No! Do not crave for those
Who died with sword in hand,
I look to my land this one,
The last time should be a desperatate deed
I will mix my blood with sand
My battle ends here
Every one witnessed I had no fear
With honour I fought
Don't cry for those who died this way,
The death which I will have
Should grant me the glory I sought
For my breed shall proclaim
How glorious was their elder one,
This is my end
I proudly mix my blood with sand,
No! Do not crave for those
Who died with sword in hand.
The Youth Of Finn Mac Cool
We were roaming through the Black head
Hungry and tired looking for food,
When we saw an old and thin deer
And we dreamt cooked flesh with beer,
We held in tight in our hand the spear,
Like the mind it fled with its fear.
Nine warriors were at my side,
Everyone incarnation of pride
Together with my two hounds for that day,
Still no food we had found,
With our usual defiance
The hunt carried on for more preys
Thirsty spears shone.
Warrior and bard poetry
Runs through your heart
Enchant and dazes you
Lower your blade.
On our path we boldly walked forth
When a red braded deer
From the north swiftly stood
Before eager eyes,
To attack we all mobilized,
But even the hounds stood still at my cry:
"Leave that deer for he should die!"
Baffled eyes turned towards me
All admired my pure ecstasy,
With calm I sang my poetry
For its beauty my will should let be,
With my words all hearts were bestowed,
Poetry's power I mystically showed.
Resound The Horn: Odin's Hail
A black host descends
Omen of the end
Fury and pride at Odin's command
Just the mountains can dare to stand,
Hordes of the gods
Almighty force
Foreign invader surely won't prevail
The army that cried loud Odin's hail.
It doesn't matter how much
I shall suffer to live
To condign my poor soul
In your mighty hands
I long for that moment my life
I shall give and if I die in this battle...
Let hammer commence!
Black mist now protect us
From unfaithful eyes,
The attack to the cross
And its god will surely succeed,
Steel at my side, banners up high,
Ancient words from the Gods
I pronounce the Viking war-cry:
Odin's hail, it doesn't matter how
Much I shall suffer to live
To condign my poor soul
In your mighty hands
I long for the moment my life
I shall give and if I die in this battle...
Let Battle commence!
This is the dan for which I was born,
I blow my last breath into the horn,
To the halls of Valhalla
I know finally
My last words are
Odin's hail!
Sacred Metal
I'm coming on the wind
to tell the story on two men
in the hands of a foreign king
they have been forced to sing
Listen to the wind it tells the story
of these men who fought
chosen by the fate to bring
the signs of their king high
searching for new places to fight
in the name of glory
they've been waiting for a long time
to wield their swords of doom
the gods have chosen them
to show the greatness of their faith
tied tortured and beaten
chosen to be proved or killed
but even in those days
they're not afraid to die because of
Warbringers
Blasphemous chants against the gods
threw us in the abyss of a curse
1000 thousand days of war and scorn
will make us repent to be born
no hope to flee from this jail
but we can't die we shall not fail
Our fate is written swords and shield
born to die on the battlefield
the curse has been cast
no place to hide or flee
we were named WarBringers.
Now I remember ungraceful days
taken as prisoners by the enemies
Under the fortress walls we will march
Our banners high again!
"...then we took refuge in the woods
with strange visions in our minds
a great plan covered by enemies' heads
until that moment I can't be dead."
Helms Deep
Goblinoid forces attack the fortress
aiming the tower with their evil missiles
Isengard banners and signs now shine
night is growing old on Helm's deep
Guthwine the blade of the mighty Eomer
Anduril the blade once broken now strong
King Theoden awaits for a last ride on his horse
Imminent dawn carries hope on Helm's deep
Will the horn resound?
Hear tremendous drums pound!
The battle at Helm's deep
Uruk-hai orks don't know their fate
Gandalf now returns on his gray horse
White rider brings with him the hope
The battle is raging in Helm's deep
Erkenbrand is coming with his red shield
Isengard's army now trembles in fear
From hills resound the horns of doom
A wood never seen
On the tresholds of Helm's deep
Resound the horn!
One Eyed God
 The lost eye for wisdom reads the runes
on which our fiery people writes his doom
 Devotion proudly sails in the lake of blood
Drunk by the ground of the young and the old
 Your allseeing eye is hight for men and gods
For whom wait the age of dark Ragnarok
 But so many enemies will taste the hammer
Of the viking hearts fiery banner
In battle my fate I'll show
it's a rite long time known
For I am your son
the wind brings my song
and you are of ravens the Lord
One Eyed God Ravenlord
Death, mist and cold plague the Niflhel
Naglfar the ship, made of nails of the dead
Sails silent and relentless, straight to that hell
There who didn't die in battle suffering will dwell
But to Asgard and Valhalla our fate is led
Because out immotrality won't serve its queen Hel
But in the higher Asgard we will kindly stand
and with strength and glory
Return To Imrryr
Yrkoon the traitor sits on the throne
Elric is back now
to show how much his hate has grown
His thirst for vegeance
now brings no name his cousin must ruin
covered by shame
Elric the White Wolf and his black sword
this diabolic couple has no rivals on th world
Stormbringer is called his infernal blade
powers unknown in hellish flames made
Dragon with the black sword!Elric!
His powerful ships to Imrryr now sail
(with) the lords of the sea
he's sure he will prevail
From his voyage returns
the bearer of the Sword
protected by Arioch and his infernal horde
"Cymoril beloved, I'll set you free
Yrkoon must die no dawns he will see"
The dragon's empire a 10000 years reign
Collapses like the towers stones fall like rain!
Nadsokor
Swords Of Doom
We're the ones
we're the ones
the chosen to wield the swords of doom
we've got to fight to free from the curse
that made us the bringers
of scorn and war
"In countless battles I'll have to fight
'till my sacred blade will shine bright
this holy sword will guide my heart
and only death can do us apart"
"Fight, my warrior,fight
Show the gods your might"
Swords of Doom
On The March
A procession of soldiers march
through the woods
vegeance is waiting to become true
the enemy's castle is there on the hill
a monument to our victory
through time will stand still
on the march!
Death is awaiting
our final day is come
praying the gods we are ready to die
make them hear our loud battle cry
battle is raging dead bodies everywhere
boiling oil and arrows
tear down the castle walls
five days under siege before our triumph
now another battle awaits
another march for lifeDragons Of The North
As blood for wolves and riches for lust
Onwards with hammers to chest
Villages burn, burn cities to dust
And for fun they torture the rest
Cold blue steel through a nice lady's breast
An avalanche of heathens set sail
To show to the world which men is best
To conquer where others would fail
Dragons of the North
Dragons of the North
Odin is working to eagerly form
A great heathen fist from north
Pray for your life when there's signs of a storm
But praying won't help when the dragons come forth
Roaming the bow, the berserkers, the fierce
They know not fear or pain
Women and children are swimming in tears
While the berserkers are going insane
Dragons of the North
Dragons of the North
Scholared embodied by blood on the mound
The clink of sword sound death chord
Bear slough and wolf slough are shaking the ground
Embraced by might the great northern horde
Odin, great warlord I greet you with hail
This new god is weaker of class
Grant me thy powers, your secrets unveil
And I'll kick this Christ right in the ass
Dragons of the North
Dragons of the North
Dreamstorm
For ages I have drifted, through storms and mists of grey
With knowledge I've been gifted, and paths to lead my way
Alone in realms of chaos, my solitude I seek
I poison therefore my arrow, and aim it at the weak
Come my winds – my dream storm
Soon I shall forever sleep
Pale I have become
Who shall for my fading weep
For faded I have done
Silently I welcome, the glorious mist of dreams
Time to send the heroes home, their end justify my means
Dawn of death, tears of chaos, echoes in my mind
It pleases me, I am satisfied
Closing in on death's desire, though I am not alone
With me comes my fear and fire, and a destiny unknown
My twilight affects me, drifting still in dreams
A gate opens in front of me, weary visions floats in streams
Come my winds – my dream storm
Soon I shall forever sleep
Pale I have become
Who shall for my fading weep
For faded I have done
The Forever Empire
I still dream of paradise
I still wake up crying
I've seen the sun, of tomorrow rise
I felt like I was dying
I still dream of forever
I still see me wave
From the deepest pits of never
Another soul to save
I still long for the sun to rise
I still fear the dark
I've seen the signs of our last goodbyes
Another submerging ark
In bitterness I've tasted my tears
A burnt out soul of emptiness
In loneliness I've touched my fears
And closed my eyes for hopelessness
Sail the waves of lunacy
Bring my presence out of never
The forever waves of time to be
I set my sails for forever
Sail the waves of the silent sea
In empty winds under rainbow's fire
The forever winds won't let me be
Wake me up from my forever empire
I am my paradise
Through my damnation you'll fall
I am the wise
In my eternity I am all
You ask of me my sanity
Divided you shall fall
Your soul shall burn most certainly
Below me you will crawl
I am my own eternity
My creations will not fail
Dream or not it's real to me
Your becoming I prevail
From my fists burns my fire
The emperor of my empire
But there will be a better day
Even I am doomed to fade away
Sail the waves of lunacy
Bring my presence out of never
The forever waves of my time to be
I set my sails for forever
Sail the waves of the silent sea
In empty winds under rainbow's fire
The forever winds has left me
I am fading through the stars, my desire
The Conquerer
Waiting for the morning
For the sun to climb the mountains
For the wind and the waves to answer my call
My sword lies beside me
My ship lies ashore
But few will stand to fight by my side
The snow is slowly falling
And gently caress my skin
Where the steel ripped my flesh
My quest is now ended
My home for me awaits
Where she prays for my return
When the winds are calling me
I raise my sword with pride
Full of hate and agony
Through the storms I ride
Fear is not yet known to me
Fight me and you'll see
The viking blood is strong in me
The conqueror I'll be
Rans web is avoided
Tall mountains salute me
Home is home again to me
I know by now
What matters to me
And those involved knows too
Thunderstorms are raging
Across the churning sea
Towards the northern sky
Awaits the northern stars
The four winds are gathered
Legions of pride awaits me
As I hail the land of frost
The Fimbul Winter
On the other side we'll stand
We're the strong
In another world we'll meet
You'll be the suffering one
On the other side we'll fight
With swords of steel
In another world we'll win
You'll worship us and kneel
You'll be the suffering one
On the other side we'll fight
With swords of steel
Then a storm shall arise
Turning the skies black
Send up a howling wind
Across the churning sea
That's just the beginning of
What awaits us all
The next three years shall be
Without summer or joy to man
The sign shall be the blazing sky
The sign shall be the grimmest cold
The sign shall be the freezing winds of frost
The sign shall be the Fimbul winter
On the other side you'll meet
Blades of steel
In another world you'll meet
Axes swung by hatred strong
On the other side you'll fight
The gods allied
In another world you'll fall
Our wrath will find you all
Axes swung by hatred strong
On the other side you'll fight
The gods allied
With fire and frost
We'll tear your limbs apart
With hammers and swords
We'll crush your warriors
With wisdom and strength
We'll conquer your troops
With hunger and pain
You will remember us
Bright shall shine the sun divine
And unsowed fields shall grow
Trees shall grow and rivers flow
Through woods as green as man
Has ever seen
Brighter every day she'll shine
The mother of our lives
Though I don't want to live to see
The day Ragnarok take our lives away
Storms Of The Elder
Awaken thou, one-eyed god,
Rise again from thine slumber!
Give us a touch of the elder strength
Flowing in your veins
And give us again the courage to crush
The embers of the faded ones
A lightning ripped the sky
The signs of ancient beliefs enlighten
The inner chambers
Of forbidden knowledge
Oh, rise the storm of the elder
Let again Gungnir fly
Into the chests of Giants,
And release again the power
Of your eight-legged horse
Ride again in front of the Oskorei
And lead fear into hearts of men
Enlighten the path for those of the elder spirit
And guide them into glory
We entered a long gone and forgotten valley
Its habitants' flames of life long gone
Ceased by a dark and ancient plague
In the heart of this forbidden place,
We awakened the spirit of the past,
And we entered the dawn
Of the slumbering one
Odin opened his eye
And looked out into the world
He lifted his arms to the sky
And called for the other gods
And commanded them to awaken
From their ages of slumber
Again they rose from the ground,
For these where still embers
Of the lost faith of them
In the halls of Valhalla
Did you heard how noisily they fight in the Hafrsfjord
The noble-kin king and Kjotvi the rich?
Ships came from east, craving for battle-game
With opened mouths and sculpture on the prow
They were loaded with warriors and white shields
With western lances and celtic 3 swords
Berserkir roared where the fight rose
Ulfhednir howled and shook the iron-weapons
They wanted to defy him, but he taught them to flee
The bold western king, that lives in Utsteinn
Then the fight was awaiting, he threw the sea-horses 5
On the shields he hammered, before Haklang 6 fell
Tired of standing beyond the land of Lufa 7
The stout-neck king 8 took as shield an isle
They cast themselves under the seats, those who were wounded
Put buttocks to the air, stuck the head in the keel
They let shine on their back bright palace-tile 9
Thinking of being wise, when then stones hit them,
The eastern clubs 10 hasted away by Jaeren,
Leaving the Hafrsfjord - thinking about the mead
The Ballad Of The Swords
Across the moor
We Norsemen rode
And scalds to us sung
That days of glory
Soon should be
When swords blood-red were swung
"One-eyed father
Give us the strength
My brave kinsmen and I
In Valhalla I
Your mighty men will meet
If in this battle I die
From the sky
Your ravens watching me
Both of them I see
Thank you father
For letting me know
You watch over me."
At the moor
The ravens spoke to me
While scalds did their song
A bitter loss
Was soon to come
For those I were among
Across the moor
We Norsemen rode
And scalds to us sung
That days of glory
Soon should be
When swords blood-red were swung
I say to you I ask you to
For once be your own lord
Come with me
Be part of my
Ballad of the swords
A sudden clash
Where swords were drawn
Was the beginning of my end
With a Norseman's pride
And courage I fought
I would to Hel them send
Instead I felt
Cold chilling steel
Stab me from behind
A cravens deed
Indeed it was
Peace he should not find
Faded I did
Strange beauty I met
The dream for me came true
Brought up I were
Bifrost I saw
My mortal life were through
Your mortal life
With children and wife
Wouldn't have no value
If you knew as I
About life up here
You would die to be here foreverFerrum Aeternum
Iron
The silence breaks the ground
A shadow is riding the horizon
An arcane man arrives to town
Remoresless and condemned
Tasted the snake's poison
Broken every bone
Felt a thousand gunshot wounds
But there's nothing that whiskey can't cure
Ride Through the crossfire
Ride Through the flames, like a predator in the night
The eagles fly into eternal sunset
The heroes die, dying for their pride
Awoken to heavy galloping
I heard the blasting whiplash
Eyes are filled with lust to kill
Beware, he's crying out your name
Now the time has come
When the Iron tears the heart
And the trumpets will ring loudly
As the stars are painted with blood
Blazing fire under the moon
Burning taste of lead
We'll ride forever
Cause' the Iron is stronger than death
Sword Chant
A flaming blade of the dark shadows struck the lands
With furious lightning it fell into the hands of man
And the ancient fire came down
Down from the sky into the ground
The clouds moved aside as the sword was cast from the sky
Burnt by a mark of fire, who shall make this find
And the grey clouds were watching down, down from the sky into the ground
...As the shapes of light were drowned
Courage's started crowling from the ashes and smoke
And the night was cursed and drifting within the winds so cold
And the knights from the sea were marching down
To the deep caverns down, down where the old spells are found
The war was growing in the old lands and towns
From the mountains war drums pounded with a deafening sound
They'll seek the Sword forevermore, until in battle they'll fall
...Now, hear the battle's call
Who dares to play with death
Who smells the dragon's breath
No grief for the fallen ones
The search for the sword has begun
Great as the mountains and seas
Grim as the earth and old trees
Made from the glimmer of golden lakes
Chained with fire that never fades
Rocks and stones they carve and mould
When the rivers run fierce and cold
May this chant haunt your past
For this Sword is yours at last
Raise the arms the battle is near
Through the mud and waters clear
The blood is coloring the lands again
A sign of victory the wind will send
Mourning Heart (Interlude)
Tale Of Revenge
He bears a tale so gloom and tragic never to be known
Into darkness now fallen, into hatred now grown
Like stillborn child drifting in the silent seas
Of blood, crushing all his dreams
No castle walls can hold the fury in his eyes
Devotion for death, now controls his life
No gold or silver can bring him consolation
Only one thing is left inside him, the desire of revenge
One light so cold and pale, sleeping quietly all alone
One life so old and gray, wandering away from home
Parted with a horrid cry, snow falls on his grief
United by the sword of wicked screams
What deeds he has done to hear those deadful sounds
In the ruins of memories he wanders, forever bound
Forever bound to death!
Wait for me in the mountains, haunt me in the winds
Wait for me in the land where nothing lives
Until the day I have found revenge, I will feed my sword
Until my heart is cold, every breath of mine is yours
Lost In Despair
I was lost, on my own
And I couldn't bear the thought of my life
I was gone, caught in the torturing memories
And they burned like fire
Water can never heal such pain
Can't you believe
Nothing is real
Can't you see
I cannot feel
Take me away
Bury me in the sand
Cause after all these years I am still the same
A sad and bitter man
Crush my hope, grow my hate
There's no home for me
Nothing to give, nothing to say
So tell me it's a dream
Slayer Of Light
I have come to unfold your mind
In my veins runs the poison wild
In the streams of mountains I flow
I have opened the doors for unleashed and endless hate
It will burn like the raging green flames
Inside a man dwell secrets so cold
Through the dreadful storms, across the frozen oceans
I have come from the dark lands with sorrow in my hands
The firewind rages in the sky
And my luminous sword hungers for more
I will leave no one alive
For I am the Slayer of Light
I... I will break your will
I... I will crush your faith
I... I will slay your dreams
I will reclaim the stars and I will tear your precious world apart
I will tear it apart
I will pull everything with me under the surface
And all the screams will fade into my dreams
Fall now! Dying light!
I will burn away the ground beneath your feet
And all will be vanished in the darkness
Dying light! Fall now!
And let the night arrive
Into Battle
We left our homes behind, now we're following the wolves' trail
Through the deepest forests, beneath the stars we ride
I can see the moon glowing red like the blood of warriors
There's a prophecy, that tonight many men will die
The fire will burn forever in our passionate hearts
Our destinies are calling us now
We are ready to take their lives
Into battle we ride with Gods by our side
We are strong and not afraid to die
We have an urge to kill and our lust for blood has to be fulfilled
WE'LL FIGHT TILL THE END! And send our enemies straight to Hell!
Prominent leaders, cast your swords in the wind as a sign of war
Men, prepare for death, 'cause we might never return
Blood will spill and heads will fall
As the swords sparkle, lights the night
The ground rumbles as we attack
In the throes of rage, we will fight
The lightning's flash, the thunder's roar
Will petrify the weak
We'll show no mercy, we'll kill them all!
We are sworn in the name of steel
Lai Lai Hei
Hän katsoi maan reunalta tähteä putoavaa
Nyt kauniit kasvot neitosen peittää karu maa
Jokaisen täytyy katsoa silmiin totuuden
Sillä aika ompi voittoisa, mut' tämä maa on ikuinen
He gazed the falling star from the edge of the world
Now the face of the maiden are covered by rough land
Everyone has to look in the eyes of the truth
Because the time is victorious, but this land is eternal
There's a place in the North, far far away
Home for the wandering man
Dreaming fields with skies so pale
Calm is the glorious land
Flames will send the sign to the sky
That we have come to feast tonight
The lakes are echoing with our song
Shadows are dancing on the forrest wall
Shadows are dancing on the forrest wall!
Enchantment of the fire and moon
Lost in the whispering night
The raven's magic enthralls the woods
Crawling in the sweet starlight
We have gathered in this distant land
Full of wisdom, secrets and tales
The morning will never rise again
Roaming wolves are howling for the dead
Roaming wolves are howling for the dead!
Oh yea!
He watched a falling star, at the edge of the world
Now the maiden's beautiful face is covered in barren earth
Everyone has to look into the eyes of the thruth,
For time is victorious, but this land will always stay true
Tears
Shadows of evening on a traveller's way
Destiny tells where the strange path will lead you
Alone I've been walking this path every day
Under the stars and the white silver moon
I hear a song and I'm closing my eyes
While its sound is carresing my poor and sad mind
Will you tonight give your promise to me
For one day the silence will sleep in your dreams
I've been waiting for so long time
To see the light of the golden bright sun
I feel no sorrow in the heart of mine
For the tears of life are now gone
Winds are whispering in the sacred forest
Dancing and singing with the red autumn leaves
These memories I could never forget
With rising sun I shall be here with thee
Tears
Shadows of evening on a traveller's way
Destiny tells where the strange path will lead you
Alone I've been walking this path every day
Under the stars and the white silver moon
I hear a song and I'm closing my eyes
While its sound is carresing my poor and sad mind
Will you tonight give your promise to me
For one day the silence will sleep in your dreams
I've been waiting for so long time
To see the light of the golden bright sun
I feel no sorrow in the heart of mine
For the tears of life are now gone
Winds are whispering in the sacred forest
Dancing and singing with the red autumn leaves
These memories I could never forget
With rising sun I shall be here with thee

Kalevala Melody (Intro)
Iron
Treacherous Gods
The Land Is Silent... Before The Storm!
On the vast fields of snow, the wind is blowing strong
With it's frozen cold and relentless touch
it leaves a dead and hollow land of ice
I have seen through the eyes of a wolf
and felt all its pain and loneliness
The beautiful land opened before my eyes
wild as a beast I ran into the night
The Calling Of The Howling Wind
Is Raging In The Realms Of North
Creations Of Ice Rising Mighty Into The Skies
And Treacherous Gods Shall Fall
Watching through the falling snow
there's no sign of life
The fire has gone out in the whirl of time
Behold the face of thunder
the storm is getting near
When the sky calls my name, I have no fear
They brought us misfortune, but their honor is about to be crushed
My blood flows cold as streams of the North
We'll never let them take our souls
The calling of the howling wind is raging in the North
Creations of ice, rising mighty into the skies
and Treacherous Gods shall fall
Time And Time Again
I Witness The Birth Of A New Born Star
I Climb The Highest Mountain
To Find The Essence Of A New Era
I guess I tramp these paths
till the end
If you, my love, stand at my side
On these paths the last "cross" is found
To where we are heading together my friend
I wouldn't swap my native region to a foreign
Even though so many would avoid this land
This farm passed from the father to the son
Even though the neighbour sold his.
I listened to my heart
It told stay here
From the world your happiness
you can't find
You came with me
to the shared home
Wilderness too
You loved so much
These roots won't
be detached by the storms
We won't be fallen
because of the breakers of life
To the children we can
Give something
That the children from the cities can't have
If one listens to the heart
It says – stay here
From the world your happiness
You can't find
It is so close,
When you just notice it
And not just reach behind the seas.
Frost
Howling winds of the North
The cold predator of the fells
Mighty woods of the North
Under cover of darkness
Desolate and dying lands
Barren ground, covered with snow
There forever I am,
Where cold winds blow
Gathering thoughts, take me
Into a whirl of silence
Gathering thoughts, give me
Strength to survive
Wail to me my winds
Fly away with frozen wings
Take my life to your hands
O' cold wasteland... of Frost
Great land of the North
The ice shimmering upon the lakes
Great storms of the North
All life frozen to death
Freezing days of sorrow
I'm alone in this infertile world
In the year before time
Old Man
So much farther off than time could reach
Today it would be too late
So much despair he has bled
But will he wither away
No one knows that you must keep
This Old Man wide awake
'cause no one knows that he could feed
Our lives with a brighter flame
Hush little dreamer, the bearer of light
Has come to set you free
Now little dreamer at last you can sigh
'cause the nightmares will be released
Sweeter far than life from I found that love was
Sweeter far than love to die as he did
The stars fell from the nightsky
As he reached his hands in the air
As the sun peeked between the trees
The Old Man burst to tears
Knighthood
I walk through the calm forest in the time of knights
And only the dark memories are left from these times
There's pieces of armour on skeletons
Of men lying on the ground
They were killed by the stab of the sword
Before me lays thousands of dead knights
Beneath of my feets lays skeletons
And only the dark memories
Are left of this Knighthood
On this ground all fought for domination,
But no one stayed alive
And no one knows why that even one life,
Didn't survive
It must have been the powers of evil,
That killed the rest of the men
On this bloodstained ground,
That which stories has been told
The Dreamer's Prelude
Little Dreamer
Once there was a boy back in time of the heathens
Day after day he just kept dreaming things that would make him weaker
His father could not make him see, that there is more than dreams
But he wouldn't listen to the words of his father, 'cause he's a little dreamer
Along his quest for solitude
A wise man came and told him to follow the stars
He ran to the forest with whirlwinds by his side
He's lost in this world of lies
Take him back where rivers flow upwards
He is the one who lives under a moonless sky looking for time
Take him back where stars are shining bright
Far in the lands of icetop mountains far on the other side
Pictures are appearing so serenely into my mind
Far in the lands of meadows of fire deep in forgotten life
Memories are drifting away so silently from light
Along his path of misery
A wise man came and told him to follow... the stars
Little Dreamer...
Warrior's Quest
(Let me tell you a story of a great warrior...)
Strike with the powers of magic stone
Grab your legacy that you behold
If you can find your destiny
Then you may return back to your home
... Ride away with your mighty horse
Ride away through the land of storms...
Unknown ar the ways of your journey ahead
But with strength and courage you can avoid your death
Throw your sword through the memories
Embracing your bleeding heart
Don't follow the shadows they ain't for real
Like guiding stars
As he falls to eternity the truth is fading
Part of him died long time ago but still there's death awaiting
Go now brave warrior don't look back
The stars will guide you through the night
But even the brightest light,
Won't reach to the darkest night...
White Storm
On this dawn the colours of the autumn are reflected by a light
A light that as been captured for years in oblivion
Circles of wind are raging now
And so his powers are slowly dying
Before the coldness rapes the lands
His spirit is wandering into the night... to DIE!
...and he heard chimes ahead playing these enchanted notes,
That lead him to a wooden cabin, where he could rest for the night...
Over the mountains
He had travelled
Across the oceans
Deep in the night
Now when it's time to
Say last farewell
Show us your power
Show us your might
Gift from the sky
His eyes can see it so clearly now
But his restless mind cannot sense it in the air
THE WHITE STORM IS CLOSE!
...and his powers gained in this mystical place more than he ever
Posessed before.
So now he could rule the realms of ice... ONCE AGAIN!
Intro
Hero In A Dream
A witch read from the palm of his hand
That his life would turn into darkness
And alone he would face all demons
From his past that he tries to forget
An elder king warned of the dangers
That lie in the valleys of north and
His only chance was to find his shadow
So he had to set forth
He is the man who travels in the land
Of dragons and magic spells
He rides in the winds of fire and snow
And he rules the forest of elves
Slash of the golden sword
A flash in the burning night
Curse of the evil lord
He is fighting for his life for the last time
Oh such beauty in time, but it's just external
He cannot see the truth with his eyes, so he is bound by a lie
The snow starts falling in paradise, as he gazes at the stars
He will be born again in the sky, when the night turns into a dawn
On the way to the ancient castle of time
He will soon be damned by rage
So that his pride could betray him
When it's time to set him free
The fears in his mind had to be pushed aside
As he walked through the gates
He will never die
'cause he is truly a Hero in a Dream
Eternal Wait
Over the Forgotten sea
Voice of angel is calling for me
Somewhere, where the mountains collide
That's where I'll find my new life
I have carried this burden so long for you
That nothing but sorrow I feel
I have let myself believe
That nothing would hurt deeper than the truth
Never has the wind blown like thousand years ago
Everything that I've known has left me on my own
Never have I felt the rain fall down like the burning flames
All I see is the face of eternal wait
I hear your silent cry
Lost in the rainy night
No reason to live for
One reason to die for
I am the one who has fallen into the path of shadows
(and that road never seems to end)
I am the one who has drowned into the river of tears
Battle Song
Let's go
Hear the sound of swords fulfill the night
Feel the winds of death on your skin
See the arrows fly, flaming in the sky
Hear the screams of men, as they die
We won this battle wit might and fearless hearts
We came and we fulfilled our prophecy
So now we shall march back towards our kingdom
With heads up high and glimmering eyes
We returned with our glory
Silence now falls upon this blood red field
Vultures feasting with the flesh of dead bodies
"This is a great moment for all of us
But now it's time to head back home victorious"
Guardians Of Fate
Race with the wind
The night is ending
They will win
When the sun is rising
Stories have been told for years about the rebel man
Riding in the lands of unknown
No one has ever seen their furious beings
And their secret remains untold
Their deeds shall be heard
Their legend will live forever
They are the Guardians Of Fate
As they shouted their last battle cries their destiny was to be dead
Their future was in no one's hands like the prophet of the moon had said
Those who travelled far away from home, they'll never return
And those who crossed the seas of hope, they all will burn

Token Of Time
Harvest the field of time
with the old man's scythe
The narrow path of the chosen one
reaches beyond life
I set sails for the ageless winds
No fear of dying or a thought of surrender
I threaten every barrier on my way
I am bound forever with Token of Time
Among the humble people
Everything is torn apart
but I'm blessed with faith
and bravely I shall go on
Are thou the bringer of hope and joy
that I've waited for years
I shall fight to restore the moon
Wisdoms of time are carved on the sacred wood
Do thou possess spiritual powers
that would dispel all my fears
I shall not die until the seal is broken
Token of Time is trusted in the hands of the chosen one
Guardians Of Fate

Old Man
So much farther off than time could reach
Today it would be too late
So much despair he has bled
but will he wither away
No one knows that you must keep
this Old Man wide awake
'cause no one knows that he could feed
our lives with a brighter flame
Hush little dreamer, the bearer of light
has come to set you free
Now little dreamer at last you can sigh
'cause the nightmares will be released
Sweeter far than life from I found that love was
Sweeter far than love to die as he did
The stars fell from the night sky
as he reached his hands in the air
As the sun peeked between the trees
the Old Man burst to tears

Far in the lands of icetop mountains far on the other side
pictures are appearing so serenely into my mind
Far in the lands of meadows of fire deep in forgotten life
memories are drifting away so silently from light
Along his path of misery
A wise man came and told him to follow... the stars
Little Dreamer...
Abandoned
Sing for your tears
a song of the hatred
No one can hear
'cause your life is forgotten
I want to give my life to you
but my will is tied with puppet strings
I am fighting and screaming alone
inside this empty room
They let you down, threw you in the rain
They let you down, sent you away... without a name
The night is dark when you're alone
and sometimes it can be so cruel
The rain keeps falling on me so coldly
'cause your wishes didn't come true
Nothing seems real anymore
as I dive into the sea of lies
I don't understand this sorrow
that keeps me sane
Windrider
He appears from the mists of a dismal lake
and the sky crumbles as he flies through the dimensions alone
The night has laid a cape on his shoulders
and with a grin on his face he attacks with his loyal soldiers, into the unknown
There's no place for him in this world, and no ties
and all this hate and grief unite in his mind
Windrider - seeks freedom with vengeance on his mind
to escape from the crimson skygrave and fly away
Windrider - is waiting for the final day
when he'll be released from the shackles of a slave
In the eye of the storm he rides with jaded memories of his life
as the fires are dancing colorfully, he is struggling to survive
Trapped in a maze, can't get away, what have you became now
Take the hammer of the elders and crush your way out
His presence is shaking the land
as he stands at the mountain peak
His instincts are getting weak,
but there is still hunger in his eyes, that keeps him alive
He wears the mask of the hunted
Arts of light for him have been granted
He lives in the fragments of time
waiting for his time to die
...Windrider...
Treacherous Gods
The Land Is Silent... Before The Storm!
On the vast fields of snow, the wind is blowing strong
With its frozen cold and relentless touch
it leaves a dead and hollow land of ice
I have seen through the eyes of a wolf
and felt all its pain and loneliness
The beautiful land opened before my eyes
wild as a beast I ran into the night
The Calling Of The Howling Wind

Creations Of Ice Rising Mighty Into The Skies
And Treacherous Gods Shall Fall
Watching through the falling snow
there's no sign of life
The fire has gone out in the whirl of time
Behold the face of thunder
the storm is getting near
When the sky calls my name, I have no fear
They brought us misfortune, but their honor is about to be crushed
My blood flows cold as streams of the North
We'll never let them take our souls
The calling of the howling wind is raging in the North
Creations of ice, rising mighty into the skies
and Treacherous Gods shall fall
Time And Time Again
I Witness The Birth Of A New Born Star
I Climb The Highest Mountain

That's where I'll find my new life
I have carried this burden so long for you
that nothing but sorrow I feel
I have let myself believe
that nothing would hurt deeper than the truth
Never has the wind blown like thousand years ago
Everything that I've known has left me on my own
Never have I felt the rain fall down like the burning flames
All I see is the face of eternal wait
I hear your silent cry
lost in the rainy night
No reason to live for
one reason to die for
I am the one who has fallen into the path of shadows
(and that road never seems to end)
I am the one who has drowned into the river of tears
Battle Song
Hear the sound of swords fulfill the night
Feel the winds of death on your skin
See the arrows fly, flaming in the sky
Hear the screams of men, as they die
We won this battle wit might and fearless hearts
We came and we fulfilled our prophecy
So now we shall march back towards our kingdom
With heads up high and glimmering eyes
we returned with our glory
Silence now falls upon this blood red field
Vultures feasting with the flesh of dead bodies
"This is a great moment for all of us
but now it's time to head back home victorious"
Goblins' Dance
Once in the time of chaos,
of sunless days and of unhappiness
The statue of the triumphant master
stood proud and grim
In the light of three descending moons,
it twisted and cracked open
Unleashing the Goblin King,
once again, for the last time
"Now the Victory is ours!"
"Let us dance the dance of Immortals"
They shrieked, as they marched
up and down the hills,
in the sighing face of earth
Misfortune and Chaos,
Grief and Destruction
The works of Dreaming evil,
and the joy of unholiness
No soul was left alone,
in the mayhem of the human race
"Hahahahaa!!!, Let us joy, Let us dance!!!"
So they danced their macabre dances
From the three ascending moons,
moonshine was spilling onto the ground,
Gruesome trophies were all around,
In the halls of the Goblin King
By The Dividing Stream
From Afar
A raven came to me,
Spoke to me in my dream.
A long lost prophecy,
A forgotten legacy.
Echoes of yesterday,
Won't let these dreams fade away.
All the beauty I adored,
At the edge of the world.
Across the universe,
Time is to be reversed.
No shelter can be found,
To this fate, we are bound!
Behold the final hour,
The last times will be dour.
All life falls into gorge
Of the end of the world!
"Burning skies
On the vengeance night.
Devastating scythe,
Of the ancient Light."
I saw the might,
Of the ancient Light!
And the beauty of the perishing world,
Theres no tomorrow.
We have been warned.
"The sky's bird struck fire,
Made a flame flare up.
The north wind burnt the clearing.
The north-east quite consumed it:
It burnt all the trees to ash and reduced them to dust."
Twilight Tavern
We heard that enemies were approaching from the south
We marched to face them, I killed their scout
But we were ambushed and slaughtered in the night
We fought so bravely but none were left alive
Now I open my eyes and what do I see
A rainbow in the moonlight, pipers calling me
They say don't be afraid and asked me to follow
You've been expected, so forget your sorrow!
Their warrior's souls forever rejoice
TWILIGHT TAVERN!
With our ancestors we raise our horns
TWILIGHT TAVERN!
Their warrior's swords forever shine on
TWILIGHT TAVERN!
Welcoming our brothers at the break of dawn!
TWILIGHT TAVERN!
Life is so short (Life is so short)
Oh! son of the north (Oh son of north)
You'll find your peace
At the end of your journey
Hey! All greet us when we open the door
Familiar faces -- "Brothers, it's been too long"
Beer is flowing, the smell of burning meat
In the morning battle reigns like hell's been unleashed!
As the sun sets behind the mountains peak,
The master of the house shouts: "Drink and feast!"
This feels like it is too good to be true.
The call for the final battle will be here soon
Heathen Throne
This hate inside me,
It is constantly growing.
Years of hollow lies,
Made pagan hatred rise.
They came with their troops,
Destroying land and roots.
Abominations under the sun,
They and their poisoned truth.
One by one my people fell,
Under their deceptive spell.
How many sons of the
Northe, had to fall?
Before our eyes could see
This isn't how it should be!
"Under the Northern star
We shed our blood.
With the call of a battle horn.
We raise our swords.
Behind the fields of blood,
There's a haven for us.
Deep in the woods of the North,
Rises the Heathen Throne"
Upholder of the skies,
For too long has your name been
Despised,
Give us your strength and courage.
When we meet our nemesis.
On the shores that used to be,
The place we called home.
Our land and faith are raped,
Somehow they're going to pay.
Grant us your revenge,
We are not afraid of death.
Let none of them ever more, EVER MORE,
Lay a hopeful gaze upon the sky!
Elusive Reaches
Protector of the sun arrives with light
From the edge of the world to the highest heights.
With a thunder blast he greets his twin,
And falls back to oblivion.
From the western plains where nature blooms.
Roams the swift brother in eternal blue.
Chasing the vanishing golden light.
Hasting towards an endless night.
Across the high northern skies
The eldest brother in all his might.
Guards the frozen barren land
With a token of wisdom in his hand.
Forlorn moon and dreadful mist
The youngest brother raises his fist.
All life slowly withers away
And the infinite circle begins again.
The trail of the winds remains unseen,
For mortals their realm stays concealed.
The ageless skies that stand before our eyes,
When we'll be gone they'll still be flying free.
Silvery light of the sea,
Sparkles of far beneath.
Cold breeze against their brawn,
Reminds them of cold steel and war!
Stone Cold Metal
Howl of a coyote wakes up a man,
A haggard shadow in this wasted land.
Vultures rise with the scorching sun.
A dry wind blows in a silent town.
Some Whiskey to clear his head
And some for the brothers who are dead.
Another day, another chase,
Vigilantes will meet their fate.
Saddle your steed
We are riding tonight
Be ready to kill
Don't flee from a fight.
Pillaging is in our blood,
We bow to no one and no one at all!
Stone cold metal in his hand,
Stirs wild rival of righteous man.
Life of an outlaw the gallows await.
Until then they shall reign!
No border is too sacred
To cross and to spill the cup of hatred.
Days to come are still unveiled,
Take whats yours, no time to bewail!
Waning daylight, time to move on
Under a looming crescent moon.
Another town, again to raze,
Surely someone will pass deaths gate.
In the silence of the night
Treacherous lady of the evening,
Deceived the whereabouts of marauders.
Ten bounty hunters are heading to the hideaway.
A dark red desert moon
Shimmers it gloomy light.
Upon a baneful affair of honour.
For a fleeting moment, eye meets eye.
Silent respect before an inevitable solution.
Dead or alive, Its all the same...
Smoking Ruins
For many years ago
He left his home behind.
No farewells or a note,
Like a thief he fled into the night.
Heart full of foolish pride,
He caused a death of his clans man
All prophesies he denied,
And now in exile he grieves.
Hear the call of the fallen ones
Wisdom of those whose time has gone
Live your life bravely my first born son,
On battlefields fight, don't run.
The wheel of time keeps turning
A boy becomes a man.
But still shame burns him.
At last he understands.
He heads back to his homeland.
He rides fast like a storm wind
But the flames in the horizon,
Tell there is only death to be found.
By the smoking ruins of his past life.
He raises his hand to the skies,
"Oh god of thunder,
God of my fathers,
Strike me down for what I've done!"
Above the darkened woods, blackened ravens sing.
As flows the people's blood, to melt these frozen grounds.
See how glows the sky, how curve the heavens above us.
It beckons, calling us, to the lands beyond the Dark Stream.
Those weakened, to the Darkest of Streams shall drown.
And when heroes, those riverbanks will reach.
The sounds of singing, across eternity shall echo.
Calling our brothers, to journey, afar, beyond the Dark Stream.
The Longest Journey
Could my ruin have come,
My day of trouble have arrived,
In these tuonele cabins
These abodes of the dead land?
Far beyond the dark stream pagan souls will
Roam those cold lands wild and free.
Wait for the sign a blood red sky.
Then beyond the dark stream we will ride.
The path of mortals,
So narrow and brutal.
Only bravest of them all
Will find true valours
Decaying souls of men,
Who trust in false omens,
Will drown in the stream
With their untrue beliefs.
He's been drifting
For so long,
Searching for the land.
Where heroes roam.
In the horizon,
The last ray of light,
A breeze from the other side,
Before he dies.
Dividing walls of stone,
Eternal heathen Throne,
Beneath the cold starlight.
Revealed for the purest sight.
Through constant affliction
Towards alleviations,
When a searing star is near.
Carry on, you're almost here
Far beyond the dark stream we'll meet again.
Across the wilderness and we will be home.
Gather your strength, don't be afraid.
Far beyond the dark stream, we'll meet again.
The longest journey of them all,
Has to be made all alone
A flame in the skyline reaching the stars
Guiding the seeker through the night!
The wanderer has nowhere to go, when he arrived at the end.
The moon will stain all shades of blue, he is the only one left out there.
Far over there from a secluded courtyard, lit the heat into the night.
Raises hunger in his frozen body, which has lived on air and water.
It hurts, but go anyway, you can always go on.
It hurts, but go right, you are here and came here as a wanderer.
Bell rings for a lonely soul, it has borrowed the voice of death.
Does it hurt or want it well, when the count of our destiny.
Stop thinking it is difficult anyway, you may take one day at a time.
The wanderer has nowhere to go, if he goes at the end of the battle.

In My Sword I Trust
Many men have crossed my way
Promising peace and my soul to save
But I've already heard it all
I've seen what they made with their freedom
But I, I have no need for your god
The shallow truth of your poisonous tongue
Brothers, it's time to make a stand
To reclaim our lives
Because only steel can set us free
Rise my brothers, we are blessed by steel
In my sword I trust!
Arm yourselves, the truth shall be revealed
In my sword I trust!
Tyrants and cowards for metal you will kneel
In my sword I trust
'Til justice and reason will wield
In my sword I trust
The sword that shimmers in my hand,
Do you have the mind to eat the guilty flesh?
To drink the blood of those who are to blame?
The time of change is here, unveil your blade!
Rise my brothers we are blessed by steel
In my sword I trust
Arm yourselves the truth shall be revealed
In my sword I trust
Tyrants and cowards for metal you will kneel
In my sword I trust
'Til justice and reason will wield
In my sword I trust
Cling your souls to your gods
Kneel, obey, follow their laws
Deceit, subjugate, cherish their greed
Disdain verity, glorify futile faith
O Old Man,
Bring me a fiery fur coat
Put on me a blazing shirt
Shielded by which I may make war
Lest my head should come to grief
And my locks should go to waste
In the sport of bright iron
Upon the point of harsh steel
Rise my brothers we are blessed by steel
In my sword I trust
Arm yourselves the truth shall be revealed
In my sword I trust
Tyrants and cowards for metal you will kneel
In my sword I trust
'Til justice and reason will wield
In my sword I trust
In my sword I trust
Unsung Heroes
Forgotten tomb hill
Unnamed graves
No light can reach there
Memories fade away
Only frozen soil
And eternal wind
Remember the sacrifice
Of those who are now buried in time
A Dauntless heart
A Righteous mind
No sign of fear
Cast aside
Left to die
Just one frozen tear
Unsung heroes
Forgotten valour
Unknown soldiers
Entombed in time
Only shadows grow
Where the forsaken lie
Hope buried in snow
A thousand scars
Regret none
But only the dead ones
Have seen the end of war
Burning Leaves
Passing aeons
Everlasting fight against the Evil
Their army grows on and on
With the darkening horizon
I'm not afraid, let them come
I will never retreat
I will stand and hold my ground
Protect the ancient tree
The defense is doomed to fall
With the world I used to know
Burning leaves
Turn to ash before my eyes,
Crushed my dreams long gone.
Burning leaves
Dead branches reach to the sky,
The flame within me is gone.
On the light of the last dying star
Serpents crawl closer
All five branches, cursed from the start
And roots are torn to pieces
Right before my dying breath
I lay my eyes to the sky
As an eagle spreads its wings for the last time
Leaving me, the oak, the grove, to die
Burning leaves
Turn to ash before my eyes,
Crushed my dreams long gone.
Burning leaves
Dead branches reach to the sky,
The flame within me is gone.
I wonder if any longer someone walks the Earth who recalls
That fair Grove afar, where all paths meet
As the last of the guardians falls, ablaze the
Eternal Tree and Domain of Man
Thus ends Our Time
Celestial Bond
A long time ago I went to the shore
I whispered my wish to a breeze from the North
The wind took the wish high to the stars
Told them what I've missed with all my heart
I was mesmerized by the rolling tide
I lay on that shore and gazed into the skies
Like a shooting star, my dream was gone
I made up my mind
I don't want to wake up
When will time heal and fulfil the dream of my heart?
When will we unite as one and light our own star?
All these memories I will treasure in my heart
Words are so vain
A bond beyond quintessence
For a thousand lifetimes
I will wait to feel
A passing moment of bliss
To be embraced by silence
Retribution Shall Be Mine
No sun rises today
No moon shares it's light
Eclipse of soul
Growing breach of faith
Pierced by bitter deception
Chained to the darkness
Left to rot
Growing breach of faith
Left to rot with hate
I can't escape from this living hell
But in my dreams the justice dwells
Betrayers are torn apart
And my hate will fade away with their blood
My hate runs deep
In the waters of grudge and unforgiveness
Leniency is for the weak
I'd rather die than show you mercy
Slaughter is yet to come
Retribution shall be mine!
Oh Gods of vengeance, fill my heart!
This is mine
The one and final fight
I choose not to die
With these demons by my side
Star Queen (Celestial Bond Part II)
The traveller's heart is meant to be free
No obligations and soul redeemed
I knew that part wasn't for me
When I met my star queen
Born in stars, like all of us
But can two paths start from one?
Unite again somewhere in time
And light the brightest star in the endless sky
Oh Queen of Stars
How long until
Oh Queen of Stars
Dreams are fulfilled?
Years go by I thought I could forget
I lived in a lie, that's all I regret
It's better for a man to die by the sword
Than wither away with undying love
I wish that the wind will play with her hair
Touch her lips, tell I'll be there
Longing for the moment for eternity
Light of a thousand stars will always comfort me
Last Breath
Lying on the ground
As battle rages on
Warm blood covers
The cold land of our fathers
Don't cry for me my son
Because I'm not the only one
Where I go you can't follow
This journey I will make all alone
I've bled so many times for this land
But this wound will claim my life
Death commands me to give my hand
Let not my people
Live under oppression
And remember the darker the night
The more beautiful is the morning's light
Fear no more
Just let go
Adore this world
Once more
The truth unfolds
In the Ancient Halls
Fear no more
Just let go
There is no shimmer of the light
In this pouring rain
I close my eyes
Has it all been in vain?
Passion, Proof, Power
Where to find the truth?
Questions linger through time
Unbreakable will and inquiring mind
Have always been the seeker's guide
The Reason as my sword
The Knowledge as my shield
I'll face my foes again and again
On the ancient battlefield
I can't deny what I've seen
So towards the great unknown
I must keep going on
Stop your quest
Or with fire you'll be cleansed
Confess...
Death...
Woe to the faith
Through dark centuries
The wait for the time
When all is revealed
Unbreakable
Stands through time
Dwells the proof of life
Eternal Earth of mine
Cleanse our souls
No good thoughts shall burn
Engulf the passion of life
Eternal Fire of mine
Carry it on
The ancient wisdom of mankind
Eternal Air of mine
Renew us within
Wash away
The remains of lies
Eternal Water of mine
Indivisible
Beyond death and life
The answer divine
Eternal Elements of mine
The gatekeeper of the knowledge
The One who was trusted the secrets of time and space once said:
To know is your destination
To find is your possibility
And to search is your quest.
Your path has merged with the truth.
But yet you refuse to see it
It's easier to be afraid, to be deceived, to be a sheep
Be aware, question them, question yourself
Because once you see it, you can never look away
Every man's
Horizon can change
But eternal skies
Will always stay the same
Like a new sun arises from winter's cold and dark grave, it's unstoppable.
Keep your twisted beliefs
Sons and Daughters of Dawn are calling me
The fire that burns my flesh
Shall light up the words I've said
The curse on my innocent name
Shall put all of you in shame
Woe to the man
Who disheartens the few
Who reach for the light
Who searches for the truth
I only have just one more wish
That this torch will be passed onto someone sentient like you
When your time comes, don't lose your heart
Have faith and patience and trust in the flame before passing it onto someone new
The greatest power of all
Will force their gods to fall
The greatest power of all
Embrace, illuminate all!
I am, you are, no one's slave
No man or god they have made
Ad Victoriam
Blood Is The Price Of Glory
Before the grimmest enemy
Cold rain whipping those proud faces
Warcries raising their spirits
Despising death as they rush forward
Blood of the brothers drains to the ground
Stirring up rage, giving the power
Trampling the enemy with their feet
Without fear they fight
Can you hear the call of the North star
Feel its longing in your heart
This bound is eternal
Sworn through blood
At the end we will stand as one!
Even if the daylight dies
Our horde marches on and on
If we should fall down to the ground
We'll rise again and never give up!
But for some it's all too much
This honorable battle and bloodshed
They flee like a swarm of craven rats
Leaving their brothers to a certain death
The last furious men
They didn't fear death or pain
They held up their swords and shields
As winners they stood on the battlefield
Can you hear the call of the North star
Feel its longing in your heart
This bound is eternal
Sworn through blood
At the end we will stand as one!
Even if the daylight dies
Our horde marches on and on
If we should fall down to the ground
We'll rise again and never give up!
Run away you cowards
We turn our backs on you
The shame that now stains your name
Will only brighten our glory
Those who fight till their last breath
And fall with honour
Their names and deeds shall live forever
Never to be forgotten
No axe stayed in your weak hand
No shield protected you from the blows of enemies
Get out of our sight
The war has no need for traitors
Can you hear the call of the North star
Feel its longing in your heart
This bound is eternal
Sworn through blood
At the end we will stand as one!
Even if the daylight dies
Our horde marches on and on
If we should fall down to the ground
We'll rise again and never give up!
Deathbringer From The Sky
High above the ground
Beyond the thunderclouds
A Black shade is flying alone
Once so feared among men
Now the legend is becoming too old
But finally the horrifying truth is about to unfold
Deathbringer from the Sky
Hunting victims in the night
Feel the terror as flames are burning bright
There is... No tower as high or a cave so deep
That can save you from its endless spite
So bow down and face your wretched destiny
A Den filled with treasures and gold
No longer calms his spirit so cold
Again it is time to spread the wings of doom
A Growl shakes the ground
Flames blind men and smoke covers the stars
As he rises towards an ancient sky
The era of total chaos will arrive
Men shall flee in fear
My name will haunt their mortal souls
I'll burn their flesh and I'll crush their bones
Now they shall know
That every myth told is true
They shall burn on my blazing gallows
Deathbringer from the Sky
Hunting victims in the night
Feel the terror as flames are burning bright
There is... No tower as high or a cave so deep
That can save you from its endless spite
So bow down and face your wretched destiny
Your screams can't make me feel pity or regret
I only feel furious hatred
With fire my dominion is gained
So burn away and let my kind rule the world again
At the time of sundown
Nature bathes in colours
In silence it waits
For the approaching force
In the halls of Ainola
The true king of dark waters
Lurks with his mistress
And a mob of a sea creatures
Under the waves of a blue lake
Dwells the mighty AHTI!
Sailors praise the glorious name
Of the ruler of tides AHTI!
At the shores of a northern land
Pray mortal men
Destruction for the arrogant fools
A Reward for humble souls
The great lurker of the seas
Is pleased of the sacrifice
The waters are calm
Today no storm shall rise!
Under the waves of a blue lake
Dwells the mighty AHTI!
Sailors praise the glorious name
Of the ruler of tides AHTI!
Under the waves of a blue lake
Dwells the mighty AHTI!
Sailors praise the glorious name
Of the ruler of tides AHTI!
Foreign ship filled with infidels
They didn't listen to the northern men
From a dead calm storm will rise
And they'll face the wrath of the sea
Take care that your heir
Don't turn out too proud
Or your bloodline will drown
Into a vast ocean...
Under the waves of a blue lake
Dwells the mighty AHTI!
Sailors praise the glorious name
Of the ruler of tides AHTI!
Under the waves of a blue lake
Dwells the mighty AHTI!
Sailors praise the glorious name
Of the ruler of tides AHTI!
One More Magic Potion
Once when we were returning from a battle and
We got lost in a gloomy forest
in the middle of the woods
we saw an old house
with tired minds we knocked
the door very loudly
Old woman opened the wooden door
She asked us to come in
with kind words
From her pot arose a scent so weird
Stunning and bitter but very summoning
Bring me a magic potion
it will heal my aching wounds
A taste so bitter that makes
my bleeding soul feel so good
It will make us sing and dance
in our endless feast
Or it might even unleash
the beast in me
She filled out pints with that devils beverage
And served another round with an hideous grin
The world was spinning in a new light I saw everything
and everyone was singing this song
With nature, trolls and the spirits of the forest
We are one let our singing rise up into the stars
The witch's magic drum was still beating hard
When a goblin brought me a new pint and together we roared
Drink and dance!
People of the forest sing with us!
Who wants to brawl with me?
Who can shape a kantele from a pike's jaw?
Like the great one once did
Close your eyes
Calm your mind and drift away from the pain
Beyond dreams
Into the depths of the cauldron
Like a rain it falls
And mirrors nature's healing powers
Surrender this time
And relief you shall find
Catcher of souls
hunter of spirits
Grant us the final frop of the life's elixir
I want to drown all my misery
Into the green trolls blood
And brown swamp drink
Fight against diminishing time
Burden of a solitary warrior's life
Catcher of souls
hunter of spirits
Grant us the final frop of the life's elixir
Bring me a magic potion
it will heal my aching wounds
A taste so bitter that makes
my bleeding soul feel so good
It will make us sing and dance
in our endless feast
Or it might even unleash
the beast in me
Wanderer
In time bleeding wounds will heal
Unlike some which are too deep to see
Like scars in a nomads soul
Their mending is so slow
Not the shout of a hundred enemies
Can make him feel fear inside him
But when sun sets and the cold arrives
With crushing solitude in the darkness of night
He will ride across land and time
To find a way through this endless night
There's a storm in his heart and the fire burns his soul
But the wanderer's part is to ride alone
With bare hands he has taken many lives
He has had a hundred women by his side
From enchanted woods to the freezing north
He is known at every sea and far beyond
As the moon grows and the circle is complete
He lies down and waits for sleep
But there's always a scenery in his mind
Of all that beauty he once left behind
He will ride across land and time
To find a way through this endless night
There's a storm in his heart and the fire burns his soul
But the wanderer's part is to ride alone
He will ride across land and time
To find a way through this endless night
There's a storm in his heart and the fire burns his soul
But the wanderer's part is to ride alone
He will ride across land and time
To find a way through this endless night
There's a storm in his heart and the fire burns his soul
But the wanderer's part is to ride alone
Raised By The Swords
Oh, who is raised by the sword
Can't be beaten
Who is toughened by the fire
Can't be burned
Awaited by immortality
Are the ones sacrificing their lives
To blood, to victory, to the truth
As ye saw, as shall ye reap
We will turn your fields into death
Shining our blades smash all down
Guidance of cold winds
We complete the ancient rule
Each of us was created to kill
Hail, the wisest ones
You have walked the severe and harsh path
To the almighty crown
Soon the lost riddles will be solved
Once and for all
As the ageless earth praises your sword
As ye saw, as shall ye reap
We will turn your fields into death
Shining our blades smash all down
Guidance of cold winds
We complete the ancient rule
Each of us was created to kill
Oh, raise the wind
Oh, open up earth
Oh, wild waters flood
And flames burn the ruins they own
Burn all and everything they own
Now let your prayers fade
The weak ones will meet their gruesome fate
Loyal minds will not break
The bold people of war
Have raised to get their victory
You depend on our mercy
Who is raised by the sword
Can't be beaten
Who is toughened by the fire
Can't be burned
Our everlasting loyalty will never break
The bold people of war
Have raised their swords
The New Dawn
Through the storm like the wind we ride
Leaving it all far behind
Another war is straight ahead
This fight will give us all
None shall live , they all will fall
When the new dawn arises, we stand tall
Fight! For our new dawn
Ride! Kill them all
Fight! For our new dawn
Rise! And we stand tall
Feel your strength and let it rise
Hear the call of their demise
Let them feel your steel
Have faith my friend, this is not the end
Our time is near, we feel your fear
Because we will...
Fight! For our new dawn
Ride! Kill them all
Fight! For our new dawn
Rise! And we stand tall
Nothing can stop us now
As we march towards the final fight
It waits us in the night
Our swords are taking lives
Giving us what is ours
Now the new dawn arises and we have it all
Fight! For our new dawn
Ride! Kill them all
Fight! For our new dawn
Rise! And we stand tall
Victory Song
The plan of invasion
an Evil deception
Was made in the halls of the dark kingdom
To steal their riches
To slave them all
To make them kneel for a new God
The Guard woke up the sleeping men
With the sound of a bronze horn
The enemy is getting closer
So brace yourselves for assault!
Swords in their hands they killed each and every man
Who dared to invade their sacred land
Victory songs are raising in the night
Telling all of their undying strength and might
Arrows are raining from the sky
As brothers fight side by side
We're outnumbered
But our destiny is to win
FIGHT!
Fight with the rage of a bear!
DEFEND!
Our homeland!
CRUSH!
Crush every enemy!
AND SEAL!
Our victory!
Swords in their hands they killed each and every man
Who dared to invade their sacred land
Victory songs are raising in the night
Telling all of their undying strength and might
The braves of the north
Didn't give in before the threat
Again the sky dome rumbles
Blood stains the snow
Many don't get to see tomorrow
Many will be missed
Land remains peaceful for progeny
Songs of victory will sound forever)
Swords in their hands they killed each and every man
Who dared to invade their sacred land
Victory songs are raising in the night
Telling all of their undying strength and might
Swords in their hands they killed each and every man
Who dared to invade their sacred land
Victory songs are raising in the night
Telling all of their undying strength and might
Lady In Black
She came to me one morning
One lonely Sunday morning
Her long hair flowing
In the midwinter wind
I know not how she found me
For in darkness I was walking
And destruction lay around me
From a fight I could not win
Ah ah ah...
She asked me name my foe then
I said the need within some men
To fight and kill their brothers
Without thought of love or God
And I begged her give me horses
To trample down my enemy
So eager was my passion
To devour this waste of life
Ah ah ah...
But she wouldn't think of battle that
Reduces men to animals
So easy to begin
And yet impossible to end
For she's the mother of all men
Had counselled me so wisely then
I feared to walk alone again
And asked if she would stay
Ah ah ah...
Oh lady lend your hand I cried
And let me rest here at your side
Have faith and trust
In me she said
And filled my heart with life
There is no strength in numbers
Have no such misconception
But when you need me
Be assured I won't be far away
Ah ah ah...
Thus having spoke she turned away
And though I found no words to say
I stood and watched until I saw
Her black cloak disappear
My labor is no easier
But now I know I'm not alone
I find new heart each time
I think upon that windy day
And if one day she comes to you
Drink deeply from her words so wise
Take courage from her
As your prize
And say hello from me
Ah ah ah...
Dragonheads
Sails up! We're leaving today
Distant lands are calling
Cowards stay at home this is a quest of true men
Farewell, should we never see again
Weeping women waving at the pier
When the sky starts to cry
But neither rain, nor wind can make us turn around
What's decided, has to be done
See how the forefathers greet, us with northern lights
Bravely towards unknown shores, through raging storms we fight
Faith in the gods, their strength in our hearts, when lightning strikes
If we die, we'll meet again in Valhalla...
In a dream I saw two ravens in the sky
And a verdant land behind
When we set out feet there, we'll burn our fleet
'Cause the land is promised to us by gods
May Njord protect us on our way
May the moon light our path
Let our spirits be purified by the ocean's breeze
Let the wind, tell our legend which ever lasts
When we reach the open sea, leaving our home behind
The Dragonheads are rising, let the stars be our guides
See how the forefathers greet, us with northern lights
Bravely towards unknown shores, through raging storms we fight
Faith in the gods, their strength in our hearts, when lightning strikes
If we die the sun will shine again beyond mortal time
We'll meet again in Valhalla!
Warrior's Quest
Strike with powers of magic stone
Grab your legacy that you behold
If you can find your destiny
Then you may return back to your home
...Ride away with your mighty horse
Ride away through the land of storms...
Unknown are the ways of your journey ahead
But with strength and courage you can avoid your death
Throw your sword through the memories
Embracing your bleeding heart
Don't follow the shadows they ain't for real
Like the guiding stars
As he falls to eternity the truth is fading
Part of him died long time ago but still there's death awaiting
Go now brave warrior don't look back
The stars will guide you through the night
But even the brightest light,
Won't reach into the darkest night...
Kalevala Melody
White Storm
On this magical dawn the colours of the autumn are reflected by a light
A light that has been captured for years in oblivion of time
Circles of time are raging now
And so his powers are slowly dying
Before the coldness rapes the lands
His spirit is wandering into the night... to die!
...And he heard chimes ahead playing these enchanted notes,
That lead him into a wooden cabin, where he could rest for the night...
Over the mountains
He had traveled
Across the oceans
Deep in the night
Now when it's time to
Say last farewells
Show us your power
Show us your might
His eyes can see it so clearly now
But his restless mind cannot sense it in the air
The white storm is close!
...And his powers gained in this mystical place more than he ever possessed before.
So now he could rule the realms of ice... Once again!
Over the mountains
He had traveled
Across the oceans
Deep in the night
Now when it's time to
Say last farewells
Show us your power
Gift from the sky
Into Hiding
The islander slips into hiding
And takes to his heels
Out of dark Northland
The murky house of Sara
He whirled out of doors as snow
Arrives as smoke in the yard
To flee from bad deeds
There he had to become someone else
He must change his shape
As an eagle he swept up
Wanted to soar heavenward
The sun burnt his cheeks
The moon lit his brows
The tree is blooming on the fields of Karelia
The Karelian birches are getting thicker
Your cockoo is cockooing and it is spring
Take my endless yearning there.
I feel your danger and your' mountain range.
and the smoke of your burnt land and your sleeping nights
and the primeval trees of your forest
and your looming inlets and the mounths of the fjords.
My journey is oft there without a goal
through forests went, bushes
I stood with a bare head on the hills
where I saw the beautiful Karelia ahead of me
Hello, forest, hello, mountain
Hello, the prince of the forest
Here is a noble boy, young
He comes forward, full of power
as the severe wind of the field
I want to be a son of the forest
hero of the gloomy spruce copse
on the fields of Tapiola
I wrestle with the bear
And the world shall be forgotten
The peace is here wonderful
Brave is the fighting
Storm is coming and forest thunders
The fire strikes long
and a spruce falls down loudly
March Of War
Axe Of Judgment
Patience is a virtue when you live for revenge
Hide your weapons, veil your hate, seek your foes unguarded and slay them!
Slay them!
Behead them!
Oh sweet revenge!
Behold, the axe of judgement falls!
This is war!
So make them suffer!
I share no thought for the dark depths where fate made me dwell
My hate has shaped me to perfection
A ruthless executioner
Remember this hate
Was the only thought in my head
When I woke up wounded on the ground
Stabbed in the back
A coward's attack
Curse you!
This means war!
If I would believe in soul
I would slaughter yours
But fear and agony in your eyes
Will have to do
When the axe of judgement falls
The vindictive one stands tall
Heathen Horde
Too many times has moon travelled across the sky,
Since our fathers sailed out for glory and honour,
It's time to fulfill the vow once given,
Forge your plows to swords, send the word,
Raise an army countless as stars in the sky.
All heathen hearts,
Answer the call,
God of thunder bless our swords,
Our heathen horde,
Will never fall,
We are hungry for blood, steel and war.
Filled with strength, valour, determination,
Determined to conquer the land,
There is no power,
In their weak invocation,
Puny invocations to their feeble god,
Desecrate and drown it in their blood.
"A coward believes he will ever live
If he keep him safe from strife:
But old age leaves him not long in peace
Though spears may spare his life.
Row!
Storm is getting near,
Row!
I can see land ahead,
No!
Show no mercy for the weak,
Gold, land and women are ours to take so kill!
One Man Army
This lifeless soil
Barren of good thoughts
Scorched by grudge and grief
Doomed to linger on
Wandered aimlessly
Blinded by their lies
Now I raise my head and sword
When shadows steal the light
Fire
Desire
Denial
Burning
Yearning
Discerning
Fire
Desire
Denial
In my heart
Burning
Yearning
Discerning
I see it now
You call it cruelty
I call it strength
I am cursed to be
A one man army
You call me inhumane
I call this life regained
I am blessed to be
A one man army
I will take the lives, lives of my enemies
Yet still this battle feels like a defeat to me
Death or victory, only emptiness I feel
The spring of hope runs dry
Because I'm already dead inside
I will take the lives, lives of my enemies
Yet still this battle feels like a defeat to me
Death or victory
Fire
Desire
Denial
Burning
Yearning
Discerning
Fire
Desire
Denial
In my heart
Burning
Yearning
Discerning
I see it now
You call it cruelty
I call it strength
I am cursed to be
A one man army
You call me inhumane
I call this life regained
I am blessed to be
A one man army
One man army
Burden Of The Fallen
Nightmares return again.
There's no way to make amends.
His heart and the battlefield
Are alike, silent and empty.
Warrior Without A War
Only change is unavoidable,
A brave new chapter is getting closer ,
Without a shroud of doubt he walked
The road so long. One dream, now gone.
What are you more afraid to find:
Something to live or something to die for?
In the end, how will you fall:
As a hero or a warrior without a war?
Why you withhold the pain but need those scars?
How will you leave to the unknown shores?
As a hero or a warrior without a war?
As a hero or a warrior without a war?
The one who is now forgotten
Carries the weight of a mountain.
No one can see how solemn
Is the burden of the fallen.
Memories, ruthless like old guilt.
Choices, accept or be haunted .
No past, no future means a thing.
The very moment is all there is.
What are you more afraid to find:
Something to live or something to die for?
In the end, how will you fall:
As a hero or a warrior without a war?
As a hero or a warrior without a war?
Is it courage to let go or drown with a sword?
How will you face your final dawn?
As a hero or a warrior without a war?
The one who is now forgotten
Carries the weight of a mountain.
No one can see how solemn
Is the burden of the fallen.
Cry For The Earth Bounds
The cry for the earth bounds
Who'll face the final sundown
On the last shore of this dying world
A man, a symbol, a sword
A vague memory of something that was
But the moment takes its grasp
Horizon so calm
Harbinger of doom
Sets the sky ablaze
Torn apart by the whirl of time
Slowly, grimly all is devoured by night
Through the night we ride
Till the edge of time
Comforting death
Under the crumbling sky
Your fights
Are over now
Lay down and sleep
Gone are
All hate and love
For eternity
No eyes to see
When the last light that dwindles
Fades to nothingness
No souls to save
In the endless darkness
No hope, no forgiveness
Two Of Spades
I go all the way
Night and day
Women, booze and money
It's all just a game
Hit and run
That's how I play
All or nothing
That's the winner's way
When I woke up this morning
Everything was clear
Besides my head
Who's the lady in my bed?
I'll shoot the moon
Nice girls won't tell
Thanks for nothing
I'll be on my way to hell
Sweet lady luck on my side
I got ace in the sleeve
Dead man's hand
I'm armed to my teeth
There is no trick in the book
That I wouldn't know
Cross me and feel
The embrace of the rope
I'm a high roller
Gambling my life every single day
I'm not a poser
Because the card of my life is two of spades
"If I may die today,
To my ancestors, beyond time
In front of me stands the gates of Valhalla
In my hand well played cards of life."]
My Ancestors' Blood (Heathen Throne Part III)
Not just for victory,
Not just to crush your enemy,
Not just for heir to be,
But for this moment and to fight the injustice...
It was written long ago,
This is what I've been told,
An army came across the sea
To conquer this low land.
They lured with their lies,
Shouted, "Peasant, kneel or die!"
Outnumbered, undaunted,
War cry rose to the skies.
On the homeland of the raven,
Where the eagles scream at daybreak,
And the clang and clash of armies,
Beautiful the strife for conquest.
Rains came over to the north,
Flood of lies to drown the old gods,
A storm rose within the hearts of the enslaved,
Ode for my ancestors' blood.
The seer foresaw the curse from above,
Like a roar of approaching giant horde,
In the moors and in the marshes,
On the borders of the woodlands,
They marched like approaching giant horde.
When I yield my life forever,
Bravely will I fall in battle,
Fall upon the field of glory,
Beautiful to die in armour.
Descendants, Defiance, Domination
The darkest hour, the hopeless time
Is always before the rise of the dawn
Find your courage to stand against a stream
The fairest they speak when the falsest they think
When mouths of men speak the words of gods
The truth will never be enough for anyone
When you reach the peak of the highest mountain
Proudly plant the flag of the heathen defiance
From the ashes of the ancient blood and wisdom
The children of thunder will rise again
Wielded lashes, pyres aflame, gloomy gallows
Tormented ones, brave and free
Screams echo in time
Not one unjust deed goes unpunished
No blood is shed in vain under the reborn thunder sign
I know we will
Claim the throne and kill
They asked for war so we will give them one
The one to end it all
Reckoning with blood
Stop the madness that's gone on for centuries
In a storm of obloquy, my sons stand strong
Marshall the forces, gather up weapons for the last war to come
Who is so righteous, uncorrupted to condemn and dominate
With truth and not with illusions
Not driven by the greed to be enthroned and rule?
Havoc no more
The reign of man
I have seen
How moon and stars glimmer
Over the waves far away
Sometimes wanderer may forget
How home land keeps on waiting
The one who is returning from far away
With the wings of longing
I fly across a distant land
To where my heart always desires to return
In front of storm clouds
In front of battles of life
In my heart I'll always be
Lady of the North
When I left
Tears of sorrow didn't flow
When I came back
I saw that something had changed
The path of a drifter
Wasn't real
But only longing and dreams
Candour And Lies
I, I have sailed
All alone
So many times
The seven seas of tears
I can still hear the waves.
Cold frigid wind
On my sails
Always takes me back
To distant memories
Home, the last farewell.
Waves of time
Candour and lies
for what I left behind,
I know the price was high.
No tears to cry
No words to make it right
But now I know that home is
Where my heart desires.
I, I was lost
No star
No shore to call my own
But I didn't know
I had it all.
On the fields of victories
And defeats
A drifter's life is both
longing and dreams
then reality.
Wasted time,
Candour and lies,
For what I left behind,
I know the price was high.
No tears to cry,
No words to make it right,
But now I know that home is
Where my heart desires.
Behold how travels the wind
Hear how runs the time
Beneath the eternal star dotted sky
Will grow a vast power
In the glow of northern lights
Rises the sword of the victor
For Those About To Fight For Metal
Outnumbered but never alone, we stand
Brave warriors, axes in our hands
The symbol of enlightenment
The secret of steel
Carved in the hearts of the free
Forged in eternal fire
Harden in the frozen rain
There is something stronger than mortal flesh
That unites us as one
For those about to fight for metal
Gods of war salute you all
For those who'll never lower their blade
We're blood brothers 'til the end
The sound of archaic battle horns
Releases the beast within us all
Join us to fight for the metal dawn
Or one by one, you will fall
Let me hear your battle cry!
Raise your swords up high!
Way Of The Warrior
Staring into dying flames
Moon as my only guard
It's too late to hesitate
Only the weak suffer in this life
It's the way of the warrior
This path before me
Destined to be the king
Of battlefields
It's the eve of the bloodshed:
Women and mead!
From the skulls of my foes
Tomorrow, I'll drink
I shall honour my blade
With deeds, not with hollow words
Men will kneel when they hear my name
Before I laugh and rip out their wretched hearts
There are warriors with broadswords
Heroes clad in mail of copper
Are on beer intoxicated
By the beer are much embittered
Two Paths
Callow dreams
Dawn of spring
No seeds of doubt yet sown in the ground
Man-made shades mould reality
Looming deceptions
Hope blurs it all
The path so bright
The path so dark
All crossroads
Illusions of our lives
No, feel no pity for a dying man
We're all just here to die, to live one precious life
None for all and all for none
It's the only law
Feed you inner wolves
With prudence
When the night closes in
It grants us the final wish
The blade may be rusty and dull
But the spirit will never bend
Unforgiving, benevolent, brave, noble and foolish
All will dim with the last exhale
Then all will be complete
Every deed has a price to pay
May sagacity and chaos bless your way
King Of Storms
Who dares to stare death in the eye?
And face the maelstrom of doom like a hero?
When light splits the sky
And like a thousand giants, thunder roars
King of storms
Descends from the skies
Before my eyes
Destroyer of worlds
King of storms
I will rule with fear and pain
Your world will burn in dragon flame
You will
Obey
Your kin
Will yield when I say
Your dreams
Your fears
Your dying screams
Belong to me
Descry the beast of the nightmare realm
Destruction of all, humanity abhorred
Ravaged land where the afflicted dwell
The frozen void entombs idle prayers and exhorts
Feast With Valkyries
Through mist we ride
Howling wolves in moonlight
Blood has been shed tonight
It's judgement time
Gallantly you fought
Made your people proud
Rise brave warriors
The journey has just begun
High to the skies
Across the seas,
Woods of the north
And mountain peaks
The song will sound
Through history
Tonight we'll feast with Valkyries
Sons of frost and steel, reinvigorate
Stay humble not brash
Because I'm the one who chooses the slain
North wind in my hair
Only me, my steed and my spear
Charge to another battlefield
Eternal chant in the air
Don't You Say
From town to town I roam and dwell
Sing my songs and stories I tell
Gone is the gold and ladies' smile
I'm living on borrowed time
This is me, no guilt, no shame
I ain't no saint, I ain't no king
I'm a man of my word
With a stone backbone
Open your arms
I'm coming home
Don't you say it's the same old story
Don't you say I came too late
Don't you say it was all for nothing
For now I am here to stay
This promise will never fade away
I have a will, hard as a rock
But it crumbled down with the very last drop
Don't ask so I don't have to lie
I'm a rover 'til the day I die
I Will Never Kneel
Winds are calling me
The cold breeze of death
From the dividing stream
The clarity of what lies ahead
Your fortune will never change
Is what blind weaklings say
But I will not rest before the day
Every peasant is crowned as his own king
I will never kneel
Before your false beliefs
By my heathen blood
I will not give up
In my chest shines a glimmer as dark as the heart of the night
I will never forgive nor forget
The grudge, haunting, dead weight,
I will never forgive and forget… never
My love, where have you gone?
So cold, what have they done?
I can't see you, the world drowns in tears
I will forgive you, become the righteous hate and never forget
All is lost now, what once was a dream
Will never be seen
Spill their blood, revenge for both of us
And for all that will never be…
God Is Dead
Bring out your dead
I shout again
Will this ever end?
Rotting corpses everywhere
But I knew how to transcend
Round and round, the bottle goes
Drown, drown all hope and sorrow
Mad men on the streets
Keep herding their sheep
High or low, we're all gonna go
Down at least for six feet
Like thunder in a pint
Divine truth I will find
Lifelong misery
It is not out destiny
Joy to the world, god is dead
So let's drink until the bitter end
They whip you with their made-up sins
They beat you until you finally give in
But know that there is another path
Filled with joy and not the grandeur of misery
Wake up and see
Drink with me
In our wanton harmony
Hail To The Victor
Scareless man
Mangled soul of a solitary
Some fights
That are fought in the mind are not imaginary
Blazing eyes
Although the road has been long
All chains
Ignorance and hate…no more
Time is the dividend on ephemeral paths
Longing of the fulfillment is carved in wolven hearts
All those, in the end, will merge in to one
These times
These lives
In the hands of beasts of lies
Man made gods
Turning tides
Unknown future, no hope in sight
Foul beings
The ultimate sin
Like fools, they charge to kill their kin
The legend tells
In the hearts of men
Is the way, the power, to rise above this hell
Hail to the victor!
Once a castaway
But never astray
In the mirror we'll see the face
Of the only god whom should be praisedStrokes from oars could be heard,
beautiful ships gushed through the sea
Like a wind from the north,
our ancestors reached the shore
Men from Hordaland, Rogaland and Adger
gathered for battle in common
Proud men with no fear
Strokes from the sword crushed the skull of the christian
A long time we ruled, kings of the north
Many battles we won, at the shores of Midgard
But, betrayed by our own brothers
we were forced down on our knees
Now when the wind once again is howling
the thoughts finally goes towards home
We shall rise in our glory
The white horde will for sure shiver
"We died like men
Therefore we never vanished
Weak is the one the enemy loves
Never betray your origin"
Frost
Loke
Laughter echoes through the night
The evening star shines over Midgard
Evil mingles in the dark
The organised cosmos' enemy comes forth
Loke, the son of Fårbaute.. father of lies
Born of earth, unbound by laws
Takk weeps no heavy tears
For the loss of the sun's handsome son
But the mare in the woods submits
For the regaining of Foster brother's favour
Loke, the son of Fårbaute.. father of lies
Born of earth, unbound by laws
The salmon glides in the waterfall
The eagle sails with the wind
Hammer groans in Jotun scull
The under ground spurts fire
Laughter, deceit, beauty and contempt
The old norse god's protector and leader of Jotuns
Fenris
Forget all laws, all order and peace
Chaos is everything no time or place
Now when all light and life ends
When the wind now is killing
The chains has broken...
The time has come
As the norns predicted
Nothing lasts forever
The battle at Vigrid shall come
There is no brothers
There is no strong bounds
The bound anger is loose
Inner coldness is free
A river of foam
Has dried up
The power of the wolf, obscure hate
No longer sees a limit
Angrboda beared
Her name justly
With Lauyíus son she breeded
Dread, hate and death
A cry of warning in the dark
The mountains roofs, bear tendors
Woman beard, the sound of catsteps
Breath from the fish, spit from the bird
Tamed forces from a forgotten time
Has held our world in chains
But not for ever!
Fenris is loose
Now our wisdom
Is swallowed by ancient hate
The nine steps are fulfilled
A new road is lain
Black Mountain Plateaus (Svarte Vidder)
The ravens are flying, the one eyed watches
Into the fog, shadows appear
Memories from the first empire covered with gold
Runes scratched in, scratches in by hatred
The hordes of the one eyed are riding once again
Hammer crushes cross
Inverted by the unbound
Dark clouds gather, the light retreats
Burned landscape, where it earlier bloomed
Battle fields for the first
A black empire, eternal winter
Frozen fields, eternal cold
Lightening and thunder commands from the first
Eternal storms, an evil monsoon
A wall of darkness
The voice is calling, the circle completed
The age of wolves
Hunger and despair
Mother earth
Expect your death
Warriors are gathered through the dream
Re-conquering the old norse throne
Under new flags
With the swords held high
The ravens are flying, the one eyed watches
Into the fog, shadows appear
Falling icons in a holy war
Black mountain plateaus the battle is won
The age of wolves
Hunger and despair
Mother earth
Expect your death
Yggdrasil
I know that I hung
In the windcold tree
Nine whole nights
With hurt point
To Oden given
Self given to myself
In that tree
Which nobody knows
From which roots it ran
not given bread
They brought no horns
Saw down from the tree
Took up runes
Took them with screams
And down from the tree I fell
Nine magic songs I got
From the famous son of
Boltorn, Bestlas father
And a drink I got
Of precious mead
Poured by Odrere
Then I became vigorous
And got wise
Grew and felt well
Of word sought word
Me word again
Of work sought work
Me work again
Jotunblod
Bottomless abyss, ginnungagap
Darkness without end before the morning of time
The cold empire's eleven rivers frozen
Frost mist spreads itself wide out
The gust from Nivlhel in the north fills the mighty gap
Licking tongues of fire from the south
Boiling, bubbling venom
All life has it's origin in a source of
Jotunblood
Your mind's own evil inner:
Jotunblood
Screams from Hvergelmes source
United with nauseating drops of venom
The first, the father of all families
Created by the two elements
With himself he breeded
Our proud ancestors
Our primitive force's deep roots
With energy from the cattle's four rivers
A knife through the dark
A shrill scream
A pale face foams
He wanders proudly over Ymer's bones
All life has it's origin in a source of
Jotunblood
Your mind's own evil inner:
Jotunblood
If one seeks all Midgard's knowledge
If the wise woman swings her staff
One can not avoid one's origin
The chaos of the primitive force:
Jotunblood
Gylfaginning
He wandered on fine old paths
He wandered along high ridges
He wandered towards the heart of Midgard
He wandered until he saw a mountain
Over a bridge wet with dew he walked
Through the golden gate of Asgard
He saw the vigorous gardens of gods
Crowned around the father of All's high castle
'O father of all, I Ganglere ask:
How have we all come to existence and where do we end?
Answer, O high, even high and third
what is mankind and the race of gods' faith?'
Gylfaginning, deception for he who was wrongly taught
But not for the one who knows Gylfaginning
Grimnes revelation
Wotan
Naked, waste landscape
Vast plains lead to the seashore in the west
A northern wind sweeps over dead bodies
A stranger has entered the domains of the vikings
Die not lying sick, dastardly coward
Draw sword, fight with the war gods
Wotan!
We shall fight until we see Ritrost
We shell fight until Heimdal flows the Gjallarhorm
We shall fight for our domains
We shall fight with the war gods
Wotan!
Die not lying sick, dastardly coward
Draw sword, fight with the war gods
Wotan!
Queen Of The Ice Desolates (Isöders Dronning)
On the balcony she beholds and longs
Queen of the ice desolates
Alone and weeping she bears the sorrow
Queen of the ice desolates
In the land where day is night and night is day
Bulks a castle with walls of ice, covered with white frost
Outside these walls exists no life
Memories of warmth frozen into snow crystals
In the land where the wind weeps, the child of tragendy lives
Horn of frost and cold, dressed in the snow
Bears who form to pearls run from her eyes
...Memories of joy frozen into pearls of ice
the woman in the castle of ice bears the curse
There where she will die
Queen of the ice desolates
A lonely raven passes by
It seeks further on towards the warmth
On wings it is free
The woman in the castle bears the curse
There she will die, but will anybody
Remember?
Heimdallr
Heimdall is the name of an Old Norse God 
He is called the Old White Norse God 
He is great and holy 
His teeth are made of gold 
His horse is named Goldtop. 
He lives where it's called the mountain in the sky besides 
Bifrost. 
He needs less sleep than a bird 
He sees night as clear as day 
One thousand miles away from where he is 
He also hears the grass grow from the soil, 
Or the wool on the sheep and everything that can be heard. 
He possess the horn that is called the Gjallarhorn, 
And they can hear him blowing the horn in all the homes.
Hal Valr
Niunda Heim
Resound Of Gjallarhorn
Strokes from oars could be heard,
Beautiful ships gushed through the sea
Like a wind from the north,
Our ancestors reached the shore
Men from Hordaland, Rogaland and Adger
Gathered for battle in common
Proud men with no fear
Strokes from the sword crushed the skull of the christian
A long time we ruled, kings of the north
Many battles we won, at the shores of Midgard
But, betrayed by our own brothers
We were forced down on our knees
Now when the wind once again is howling
The thoughts finally goes towards home
We shall rise in our glory
The white horde will for sure shiver
"We died like men
Therefore we never vanished
Weak is the one the enemy loves
Never betray your origin"
Waves are cutting like a knife of time
On the slippery rocks that still stands besides the shore
Two eyes are eyeing the seas
Towards the seas that once brought his ancestors glory
A lonely mind is longing
For the raising of sails
A swordarm is longing hungrily
To cut the throats of cowards
A forgotten treasure is now recovered
Brought out from the darkness of Midgard
Its powers will never again disappear
It is guarded by a man from Hordaland
A night of sorrow will soon be over
Memories from ancient times will glow
A wind blows away the dust from an ancient sword
Two ravens will predict his return
The sets in the west
He lifts his proud face
He looks towards the North Star
The Man From Hordaland
Bring forth your sacrifice
The winter can last for long
Show them honour
Servants of Frey
Let the blood flow
On his pride
Until they are pleased
To provide our magnificense and growth
Our king will show his wrath
If we do not honour our promise
Poor the harvest will be
Without seeds in earth
Don't spill the finest blood
Strong sons will not be born too often
"Oh, wise Volve when shall I get to see, fields of growth
When shall I once again feel the light touch from Freyas hands"
Death comes fast
If you do not honour
The people below
The friends of the Vanirs
Bring forth
The holy boar
Then the sun will still shine
And we can still breath
We didn't wish to die
We didn't wish to awake
The wrath of the elders
Bring forth the holy boar
A war ruled in ancient times
Between the holy races, the Vanirs and the Aces
When peace came, the deities united
From a bowl filled with spit rose Kvasir
"Wise he becomes, he drinks the holy mead
The blood of Kvasir, but not he who drinks
From the spilled mead that dripped
From the falcon"
Kvasir the father of poets by dwarf hands he died
From the blood of Kvasir they made the mead of poets,
The holy drink
Fjalar and Galar once murdered Gilling the Giant,
The father of Suttung
Enraged, Suttung demanded justice to be fullfilled
The blood of Kvasir became the mead of Suttung
Grimne flew out from Valhalla
In the shape of the falcon
To the home of Giants and to Nitberg
Bauge was decived, and Gunnlod betrayed
Out from Nitberg the falcon flew
Finally Kvasir should return to Aasgard
But when the mead disappeared Suttung became furious
Out, in the shape of the eagle he followed
Sadly, Grimne had to spill from his valuable treasure
Which led to the making of the false poets
The falcon flew home to his domains
And Suttung flew into the flames of Tjalve
Hymns were sung
In the times when our people still were proud
In the long gone past
A long time ago
Then came the disease
The disease from south
Deception and false knowledge
Infected our minds
Survival of the fittest was forgotten
But still it didn't disappear
Beneath the layers of a thousand years of deception
Burns the ancient northern thoughts
Fight! Don't let your powers disappear
Our sunset shall also be our dawn
They burned our temples
They killed our men
We shall take back
What once were ours
Fight! Deny not your mind
Our sunset shall also be our dawn
We shall once again sing
Hymns from ancient times
Like we did in those days
A long time ago
The silence inside this place is screaming
Here, were the roses never wither, as they never bloomed
Here the sun never shone
Even the darkness never came in
No hope, no fear
An ocean of tears, that never fell
Tomorrow brings remembrance of opened wounds
The light invaded the endless darkness
A soul, which birth was denied
A soul that became forgotten
The darkness fades away even the brightest colour
The street is empty, and leads to nowhere
A shrilling scream, that no one heard
Who cares? We can all be free
"Tomorrow is a new day
But today was new as well...
... For only thing is fear fealt
The fear of life"
Fallen asleep, wrapped in a blood red blanket
Two dead eyes are staring into emptiness
From a soul, which birth was denied
Death greets the one life forgot
Born in a flames in the time before time
In the sparkling embrace of Muspellheim
Born to be your souls darked depths
Before Audhumla, our ancient mother awakened
When your eyes is glowing with hate
A hate older than both men and gods
Then you see the light of Muspell
To strong for any man to tame
The oldest force will man never understand
In the deepest domains of fire, man can never reign
Stronger than the grip of death
Mightier than the lights of Norns
Wiser than Fimbul-Tul
More betraying than the son of Faarbaute
That, who once brought forth life
And gave us Mother Earth
Shall return in the flames of Surt
Our flesh shall burn at Ragnarok
Our souls shall be united in FROST & FIRE
Living Beneath The Hammer
Windswept landscape, desolated mountain plateaus
The Deepest woods and darkest scrubs
Flords and mountains are our landmarks
in a life beneeath the Hammer
A long and narrow kingdom
Ruled by trinity
From stormy mountain tops covered with snow
We behold the kingdom of the Hammer
We ride along the paths of Midgard
Fog from the soil rises at our feets
To the west the shore can be seen,
where the first sat foot ashore
Where they raised sail towards north
A Winter's Night
A dark, chilling winters night
Unsilently awoken by song and dance
From above rains the golden arrows of Thor
Moonbeams enlighten the ring
Nine torches for those nine in the circle
Surrounded by nine shadows for nine souls
In the middle, an altar of fire, soil, water and wind
Look, and behold yourself
Fires Of Midgard
The call of the Gjallarhorn
Return to the ring of our forefathers gods
The flames of Midgard's fires and ancient mystisism still are
rides with terror above the village
Mjolner is swung, thunder and lightening!
The landmarks of the Vikings
Wolves and ravens guards the throne
Heimdallr
Heimdall is the name of an Old Norse God
he is called the Old White Norse God
he is great and holy
his teeth are made of gold
his horse is named Goldtop.
He lives where it's called the mountain in the sky besides
Bifrost.
He needs less sleep than a bird
he sees night as clear as day
one thousand miles away from where he is
he also hear the grass grow from the soil,
or the wool on the sheep and everything that can be heard.
He possess the horn that is called the Gjallarhorn,
and they can hear him blowing the horn in all the homes.
The ether is dripping, the earth is quaking
I am writhing with agony, chained to the mountain
I am your fear, I am your torment
You attemped to tame me, you caught me in nets
I will not be budged, I am chaos, I am your shame
I am your highest wisdom, and your enemy
'til your dying day
Bound I am, but I am laughting  at you
Do not believe that I am here to serve you
I am from a world you can not comprehend
'Cause I am Evil I am the Primal Force
One day we shall meet at the fields of Vigrid
One we  I shall be free of chains and ether
That day you will understand
The purpose of my excistance 
Why the laughter is roaring in the night
That day we will fight our last battle
The sun turns black, ground slides into the sun
Brave stars are fading in the sky
Smoke rises from great fires
The flame plays up high
Against heaven itself
Urtical Gods
Activate the aggression that exposes the
Hidden,
Denying the existance of praying to
Illusions
Seek gnosis in the forbidden
Drink from the wates of knowledge
And see what lies you breathe
Absorb the vital spark of deities false
And ressurect the true gods
To whom strength and wisdom is the key
And not the lectures of folly
Annoint your sould  with pleasure
Apposed  to mummifications through impotence
The truth is unconscious, asleep
Waiting to be summoned, to be worshipped
A neglected phallos, banished from thought
A weapon overseen by the creator
But cherished by those of the path
The ship left for the sea
Never will she return
She is safe in the starry night
The journey's been long
The dream comes to the sleeping
Brings him where he longs to dream
Further from thought,
free from the flesh
No answers, no circles
eternal birth, eternal death
"...I took and received
I fell, flew and walked
It was dark and I saw
Deep below, where silence roars..."
We wandered far and freely
The light came, and the sight faded
The houses are abandoned, and the sky is red
The ship is leaving for the sea.
Horns are resounding, the winds are howling
Drums are pounding, the winds are howling
With spear and bow we go into battle
We are making a stand, brothers in blood
With hope for honour in the name of madness
We will never be defeated, even if we fall
We are not going to Folkvang,
Into the arms of the Vanir Queen,
We shall  our fathers if we fall today
We will not flee from our destiny,
even though the winds aren't blowing our way
Brothers, to Valfaders hall
With spear raised in the name of Oden
We shall raise mugs in the name of Oden
Cowards shall fall at our feet
They do not have to pray for sun filled days
No one remembers a slave without a master
Defeated they are when they fall
We raise weapons for our faith
We slaughter the fields for our faith
We have no mercy for those
Who turned their backs
Those who attemmp to close the well
Shall die
Those who lied and betrayed shall die
Give us strenght , give us courage
We will prevail
Brothers in blood
The darkness of Utgard, far out there
I can not enter, are you demanding sacrifce
I demand a sacrifice, no promise I will give
I can provide you with strenght , I can give you death
You say you can end my days
But without my excistance , would you not be
Creator of weakness, me you can not threaten
Learn how to see with the right eye
Obscure One, you attemp to get me on my knees
You speak through riddles, and call forth my wrath
With wrath, weakling, nothing is achieved
I demand your wisdom, to make you understand
You want me to suffer, and even to die
You are forgetting my power, you are but my slave
Your source of origin you're forgetting, your praising deceit
Your world is an illusion no wholeness, no answer
Order I crfeate, but your opposing me
Your speaking with a cunning tongue, what are your demands
I am demanding a sacrifice, I demand to see you bleed
You have dared to oppose the Ancient Ones that brought you into excistance
The darkness  of Utgard, a sacrifice was demanded, a sacrifice they received
A mind was strengthened, but the flesh was lost
He who dares becomes wise
"He gave his eye to see
He bled for those who let him rule at last
But no promises they gave him, no peace became
They shall still be fighting 'til the earth sinks"
You killed my son, I am swearing revenge
You destroyd my path, and truce with my peaople
You blackended my name, they believed you
You saw my destiny as mockery
You was me dying with my fatal wound
You thought I would never rise
You thought the light was your friend,
That you sprung from it
You thought everyone would obey your words
And forget the gifts of Valfather.
You forgot your father's wise words
of betrayal, destiny and death
You forgot your duty as a man of strife,
and killed your brother sleeping
You thought time would heal the wounds,
that my people would forgive and pray
You forgot about me and my holy duty
I will kill you with anger
Vengeance in blood I swear
Vengeance in blood I have always sworn
In solitude she cries, the most beautiful of them all
Captured and locked in a sorrow no one can conceive
Joy vanished far out there
Burning desire, but no hope
She longs for home, bu tcan not find a way
A dismal destiny hidden behind a smile
Mardol, you glorious, sacrificed for peace you were
You sold your flesh, but found no comfort
That which glitters does not bring you peace
Gern you devoted yourself
and consumed many desire.
But, still in the night,
gold is dripping from your eyes.
Frõya, Od you shall find when everything ends
Then you shall be set free
Untill that day you shall find no comfort
Not even in the shining Brisinghamen
Floating patterns of no coherency, none needed
From behind the chapel of dreams came imagery
From another world
The left for a brighter star
A new home called "now"
Womb - death - dawn
Follow seafarers on an ocean of silence
Remaining humanoid shells, a distant thought
The chasm between truth and flesh paved
With bricks from secret cities
Entering linear orbit
Crushing the foundations of divided times
Suns reflected
Convoys...
Convoys to...
Convoys to nothingness...
The Voices
I hear their poisonous words again
As they call out for submission and code
"To be less than one and drown equals pride" they say
These were the voices that destroyed us
Did I want for this loss to be sustained?
Through the clipping of wings found the secret paths
From the blinding light of lies obtained second sight
Stabbed in the back, gained strength in One-ness
Taken from me, I learned to preserve
These were the voices that sunk our ships
These are the voices - poisoned ears bleeding
Did I pray for the dead to be kept awake?
Did I gently place these thorns through the surface
of my eyes?
Did I ask for this fathomless tragedy to go on forever?
Fail to comply - reborn in war
The answer being no
Did I?
Betrayed by disillusion
Enslaved by insanity
Enslaved by commitment to betrayal
Betrayed by all elements
My vision is clear and strong
I comfort myself to fulfil it
There exists no edge
Clearly existence is wrong
I kill myself to fulfil my vision
Consumed by astral interference
I deny this monument to be my sphere
I choke this ego to find that i'm dead
I deny this monument to be my sphere
I will die as one
Hollow Inside
Hollow inside - I didn't sleep too well last night
Step over, turn the light
Hollow inside - I didn't dream too much last night
Step over, turn the light
Knock on the door - these are the interfering themes
Open it up, too soon
Shorter in time - the interactive parts go by
I fear for a while - my head
I fear for a while - that my head will expand
And stretch out in to the stratos wild
Can't you see, those birds in limbo breaks
And of course you hear, listen, the straws
From above you, and underneath in the glow
I can touch them
Spiritualized
Dogs with bones, they are released
One too many to get on
The Cromlech Gate
"Fear not dear kinsmen, cause you
Saviour I am. I'll bring back our glory
And wisdom Achieve I'm searching the
Old path to bring back the elder"
Smug as only the fool can be, mindless
Blindly. He marches towards his fate
Summoned by the Cromlech by hunger within
"Come inside my friend, your father is waiting.
Your search ends here, Wisdom you have
gained, the signs you have read."
Doomed to walk the smiths dungeons
Underworld slavery
Through the eyes of the fool nothing can be seen
The elder is hiding beyond thoughts
Only leaving with glimpses of long lost knowledge
I once saw the Cromlech and was kindly invited
But I stayed the beast I kissed the ground
(I drank the wine)
(I took up the runes)
I found the home of the elder
Enemy I
It was here I was born
While the stars held their breaths
After ages of pseudo-presence
I climbed the final steps
Up from deep beneath the shores
Eieth no longer sleeping gal
Thus alive and the stillness
Only to be broken by whispers
Towards the moon
Bloodred from the Unborn Ones cries
That will not be silenced or rest
Forever more and awaken not
To paint in blanks or wither
Beauty blinding no more
than the whole is less now
We see clearly what was not there
The prey become predator
Slaughtering not raging blindly
Through tunnels of sorrow and lust
For solitude and peace of mind
Says it is time to unmask and face
Behind lines  - that is Enemy I
Smirr
He sees his world through the crystal state of departure
The hooves echo the approach of the third coming
On it's back a goddess with shining black armour
The steel that will separate the will from doing
Closing in as he falls to his knees, surrounded by
Plasma of dying chapters
Life succumbs to silence, desire alone to the dying
Of inner banes
His hands no longer grasping contraction as he laughs
Winds play their mourners dirge through heaps of corpses
The hooves thundering the arrival of the final coming
Carrying forth the seeds of eternal night
So that the Shadow may sleep, eternity weeps
While we laugh and remain forever
She feels the cold floor giving no comfort as she fades 
The hooves echo the approach of the third coming
On it's back the faceless her Elder Ones saw
The agents of microcosmic change shattering the megalith
Stories told, divinity unfold
She passes on, yet remains in Smirr
Cold remains scattered in dead void dreams
The Sleep: Floating Diversity (A Monument Part III)
The battle's now past
The war of all was within itself
Painfully sleeping
All hail the fallen
The time is now for the king to tell
The battle's now past
All hail the fallen
Pleading diversity equals no scream
Thickening intensity now fatal
Beyond portrayed dream
The rooster fell dead in the dust
Before the break of dawn
But I knew time
The horse hung from worn out straps
With ungreatfulness
Wipped into his eyes
But I pulled the plow myself
The peasant laid himself down on the fields
Neither plenty nor free - but I cleared new land
Growths withered, eternal oaths shattered
Colours faded, hearts froze cold
The noise silenced, but mine was victory and might
Larger than time - heavier than night
Mountains fell, forestgreen to black
Time turned to silence, water to sand
The sun went cold, gone all but one light
Larger than time - heavier than night
Days ended, and the stars died
Before the wanderers reached home
But I knew the way
Ships sunk with all warriors and heralds
Laid to rest in bottomless pits
But I spotted new and unknown shores
The gods suddenly aged
When the golden walls fell
But I gave them new powers
Like an open wound
Who could endure
If i follow you, will i be like them
Standing tall, with the flag of the hanged ones
They were like the trees
Lifeless - did not speak
Did not move
Cold hand, empty eye (Mimir, do you hear this?)
It is a long journey, but are you growing tired?
Time stands still, everything else is dead
Blood and hymn
The god of corpses' sun
Shines in one and everyone's face
Urd answers in echoes, what will you do?
Where is your hammer
Thurisaz calls: smashed hold of illusion's roots
They were like trees
Lifeless
Did not feel, did not hear
Cold hand, empty eye
Ymir, do you hear this?
They were life trees
Lifeless
Ymir, why are you silent?
Entrance / Escape
I am not in there
I am not taking any part in this
There's no comfort where you are
And I won't give you anything
I am close to them mentally
But I am inbetween realities
There is no directions for where I am
They can't find me 'cause I am not in here
A troll screams with longing
Gods drown in fatal wounds
Tunnels of rot grows inside
Strong arms
The mountains will no longer be moved
Only the slave owns his own freedom
When kings follow the laws of christened men
Who will carry forth the silver
Who will guard the bow
Who will judge fairly
With hearts of coal
Worm with no skin
Who would want to
Enter such a world
The great men kill their children with blunt swords
Let them regret
Let them suffer
But give them no comfort
Never give them your hand
Never let them see the eye
Toothless bastards
Who wants to hear such words
The white christ kills his mother
Let them freeze, let them starve
But give them no comfort
If the few endures the journey
Then, we will build the wall
If the few endures the journey
Then we will build the wall
If the few endures the journey
Then we will build the wall
Seventy and thousand feet below
A pulse is beating more evenly
And higher
Waves expand like heartbeats
Through silent mosaic
A wise man
Three heights he was
Once came down here and said:
"What was, was never"
Then they saw the river
Burn, and the sun bled
Then they saw the river
Burn, and the sun bled
A norn
She came too
Down from the roots
And the tree of life
"Everything will die and decay
Silence will once again prevail"
Then they heard the song choking
And the children dying
Seventy and thousand feet below
A pulse is beating more
Evenly and higher
Empty universes in every world
Up there, where dreams die
Fall in flames
Trapped under ice
Ridden by nightmares forever
The ending blue
Obscure and promising
In ancient red it orbits
That which once
white was black
Empires circles time
From other to one we go
Deceived to see eternity
If blinded
Silent nothingness
The mountains are moved
From the stars
And the fool
Sees nothing but stones
Empires circles time
From other to one we go
Moaning no one could
Stand listening to
Fills the inner worlds
Clutching the chains
That does not exist
Why not live
Without them?
Empires circles time
From other to one we go
The ending blue
Around a merciless mother
Who will caress us
With the burning skies
Of the last days
The herd ate it's shepherd
And starved to death, smiling
They didn't reach the meadows
You loved your neighbour
And ate your own mother
Losing your own war
Slave in your own chains
You look to the sun
And freeze to death
Torn apart in golden cages
Strangled by purity
Kissing the hand that killed your own brother
Be sure of this
I'll never turn my back to you
Be sure of this
I'll always mock you
Consider what you've created
When you're waiting for death
Listen, out there
Where our laugher is resounding
Think of what's waiting for you
You miserable fool!
We laughed as the hive burned
I went into battle
When the strangers came
I fought for my home and my herd
I struck them down
With my spear and bow
So that those at home could sleep and eat
I drank and yelled
I laughed and bragged
Of my victories, my courage and my strength
I told of the gold I found
At those I had slain before me
Suddenly I awoke
A cold and dark morning
With a dead herd and slaves escaped
All mead and all my friends were gone
That was when I went away to promising land
For once again to return with honour
Everyone that crossed my path
Was to feel my strength and wrath
By a flood stood an old and tired man
He guarded a boat which I needed
I charged to cut him down
But the sword broke
And the old one stood there grinning
"Poor fool, who never had seen
That a warrior shall fight against warrior
You'll never win if you're only looking ahead
And never inwards"
Suddenly the old one was gone
And the wind carried away the boat
By the shore I stood looking
But could not reach the other side
That's when the battle begun
Against the warrior I always thought I knew
I hail the living room with pride
Greeting me with flames and sea
...only he who dares is safe
Home - to a starworld of silver
Home - wolf, man and house
Kenaz - behind the eyes burns the
Light which we own
Raidho - on thoughts above
The sun and rain
Anzus - at the throne of our father
I laugh towards the holy wheel
She will provide us with answers
And the light
Then again we are swept in
Another darkness
...only he who asks becomes wise
Home - with stars of silver
Home - wolf, man and house
("I am - am I")
Warrior, never ask for peace
Husband, always long for home
Here we will be gathered
...if the rune is spinning
Intro: Green Reflection
Lunar Force
Farewell my brother
Farewell my foe
May death embrace you
Your blood in the darkness flow
You were never meant to rule
Never to light up my father's throne
May you suffer deep below
You tried to deprive (me of) my rightful crown
Fallen, defeated, tricked by Beorc,
The Lunar Force
Behold the sorcerer when you're
Impaled by the sword
Farewell my brother
Farewell my friend
May she have pity with you
We did not wish for your life to end
The day will bleak when
The Old One arrives
The King betrayed by his treacherous mind
Defeated by Beorc, The Lunar Force
Isa
Been standing here for ages
Watching the valleys blossom and burn
The pyres of yesterday smells of losing you
Preserved we are, portraits (in the glassy depths)
I picked up the shattered mirror, put them in water
Cold as my dreams
Isa: Still - Standing - Empowered
Isa: Watching you die, with tears of ice
Isa: Detached - Silent - Ecstasy
Isa: We are the dead
We arrived here from different spaces
Bidding the wooden shrines farewell
Concealed within dead lips lies the rope
That forged us and then tore us to shreds
Distant opposite assembly at the shores
They're telling me it's time to let go
A time to burn, a time to build
With your own hands a room within that room
Bring it all towards the centre and tremble
Bring her back from the shadows and kiss her
Retrieve the sword from the abyss
Hold back the tidal wave
Isa: Still - Standing - Empowered
Isa: Watching you die, with tears of ice
Isa: Detached - Silent - Ecstasy
Isa: We are the dead
Ascension
Staring across the void, seeing eye to eye in folded space
I see you with the colours and frenzy of the sacred rooms
We've met in those dreams ice blue water ran towards the green sky
The gods spoke to us in their infancy
Suns waiting for us to smitten them with the flames of our disease
And we did so laughing, giving birth to sunrises in our wake
Never in need of sleep, nor in need of truth
I would never have stayed in this darkness, and we would ascend
The taste of ash, no stars above - No green grass below
The last words set ablaze as we saw the inner imagery
How it all came alive when we no longer reached for it
How it all rose and overwhelmed the speechless (us)
In this house without words we came to be one
In these books without text we found the way
A path along a faded memory, without the fear of finding home
We would never have stayed
We would never have stayed
We would never have stayed in this darkness
We would never have stayed
We would ascend
Bounded By Allegiance
Brought here by sorrow
Raised in the depths of fear
Consuming sanity
Feasting on the joy of Man
Surrounding the trembling mind
Surrounding the troubled soul
Strength failed to tame the serpent
The offspring of laughter and sadness
Saved by the power of its kin
Obeying the whispering chaos
Pulsating underneath your skin
Feasting 'till the end of time
Denying all peace within
Fearing the freedom it never feels
Bounded by allegiance
To long gone sanity
It lurks deep below
Emerge at the last step
Violet Dawning
I am a part of the darkness
Used to watch from afar
Sensing the violence of morning
And breathing... And waiting for nothing
Devouring the spirit, grinding the heart
There are good things in the burning fields
There's peace in the slaughtered flesh
There's life in the frozen seeds
I'll dream in the deserts
And comfort the thirst for seeing
The violet dawn in the distance
Beckons me to steal its light
I'll wait for you here
I'll wait for you here
I'll wait for you here
I'll wait for you here
Return To Yggdrasil
A new sound heard throughout the land
From which the spirits had left ages ago
Sacrifice and honour replaced by betrayal and usurpers
A trail of sweat and blood, a gathering to the pagan
outer worlds
For ages we have wandered
Under the wings of deception
Too long have we been waiting
For the long winter to end
An uprising by those that claim the Supremacy of One
Against the misleaders of the blind, deceivers of the Masses
Man can no longer claim ignorance as reason for waiting
It is all for the taking, the world for their making
We will gather again
Under the leaves
We will gather again
In honour of the nine nights
For ages we have wandered
Under the wings of deception
Too long have we been waiting
For the long winter to end
We will gather again
To praise the courage
We will gather again
To watch the harvest
Secrets Of The Flesh
Neogenesis
Navigation by the fires of dead worlds
Towards the shores of Neogenesis
Navigation by the fires of dead worlds
Towards the shores of Neogenesis
Distant self now cut through, approaching infinitely
Racing hearts throbbing deep beneath the painted bones
Mars opens the hidden doors to Venus
Lunar flight crashing into solar storms
Blinding unification - vertigo - ecstatic curtain fall
Get ablaze by inner arson, endlessly reborn
Winds, oh the winds that speak of your salt and blood
Break open the dam, flood the deserts
Shocking white pulsar radiant dreams drawn in night sky
Ice-glazed branches undead by rays from an impossible sun
Crystallized pathways towards runic chambers concealed within the microcosmos
Revert away from the predicament, flee across the abyss
Severing the fetal cords spawning fusions by the thousands
Through bent space created black channel - pagan relay
Sensations of flesh flickering
Praising death through bleeding eyes
Neogenesis
As Fire Swept Clean The Earth
I close my eyes
As Fire Swept Clean the Earth
Nothing left to strangle
As the cords were torn from our hearts
"Tired I blew out my last warning, the claws were ripping me apart"
As we emerged
From darker dungeons
Splendor of yellow hells
Expanded swollen eyes
No words were said
As Fire Swept Clean the Earth
Would the mothers be crying?
If they saw torches in our hands?
"The wind, once able to conquer, captured As Fire Swept Clean the Earth"
A kiss was placed
Upon my cheek
And all color came back
Melting in solid blue tune
The Dead Stare
The Juggler stares
To quench the thirst
Upon the brow
Within the hand
It cracks and seeps
The seer weeps
In flickering light
The wounds are served
Screams from below
A shadow in chains
Feverish images told
In mirrors of old
The eyes they all share
In this tragic court
An empty seat
The river runs dry
Nothing said
Words in red
Behold the druid
As the stones fall
Known aloud turned
Backwards around
Reverse the loss
This never was
The Crossing
I no longer struggle
No longer see
Nothing remains, burning anxiety
Darkness came forth
Gave birth to me
Certain death is all I see
I see you weep
I see you suffer
I've seen kingdoms rise and fall
I've seen all that's supposed to be
Earthbound forces, united with sorrow
The path was given in ancient times
Embraced by hunger, forgotten by will
The wisdom is hold up still
Break the chains, come forth to see
Cross the abyss not meant to be
Cross the river, find the key
Kill the queen of anxiety
Queen Of Night
Across the scorched fields of fathers land
In each step an abyss is built
Through misty dreams he touched her hand
The boar is dead
Its blood is spilt
He set his foot on the slopes of far away
They'd been asleep when his sun roared
He walked through night, walked through day
Landless mourning lord
"Why should we let you by?"
The road is blocked by men of three
"If you need ask, you already know"
They said to let him pass, to leave him be
At the shores of sorrow
How far he'd come (to see her eyes)
(After) Moons and more moons
He'd be there tomorrow
"And I would travel across the water
To where she lies"
On the sea of solitude he rows
The winds howl her name, he has no fears
Tired and smiling he falls, downwards he goes
There she is, waiting after all these years
I see a darkness overwhelming
I see that there is no light for me
I don't care if it leaves me blind
I don't care if I'm left behind
I see a white horse's head
I see it's dead stare fixed at me
I do not fear its eyes
Curse myself, return it twice
I see walls to high to climb
I see nothing on the other side
I should have roamed another space
I should have been another place
I am among ghosts when I should rest
I cannot tell the worlds apart
I do not heed the words they say
There is no dream of another day
I hear a silence, deafening
Drowning the deserts, that is my destiny
I no longer wish to see
The threads they've spun for me.
Ridicule Swarm
Pallid it hangs
In awe of amusement
Litany swarm
Bleak I say are the crutches of the assembly
And flies cling to it
More so ever the fingers to animate
Insubordinate, fickle exequies
Putrid core
Naudr........the ligature it can't break
Lagu...........the whispers it can't hear
Insubordinate, fickle exequies
Putrid core
A Darker Place
Behind the walls
Below the lights
If you came upon a door
If you came to push it open
If your eyes could see within this dark
Your heart would flee
Nails and blood
Painted by delirium
You would feel the empty stare
From a darker place
Silent screams
From ages in the void
Desperation
The voices fill your ears
Head back into the light
Never to return
This dream will haunt you
From a darker place
Behind the walls
Below the lights
Entroper
I am the creator of true will
Long have I suffered
Long have I been forced
Blinded by their faith
Laughter resounds no more
I am the son of the ancient breed
I do not pity life
I follow not pathetic order
I am the realm of absurdity
Resistant to their conscience
Free of their constant pain
I was born in the flames
Long did they hope
That my logic would save them at last
Long did I know
That I would watch them die
While harvesting their fruits
Of their impotent threats
They forgot the potency
Of the old independency
Claiming my death would
Change the way of existence
Who, but me handled them?
The weapons of hope
They turned safely into non-existence
I will break the chains
I will slay the betrayers
One last time
The laughter shall resound
Path To Vanir
Awaiting my death, gasping for air
The relief emerge, the mistress so fair
Don't abandon me, please grant me life
I embrace your powers, higher wisdom's wife
I've been fighting in vain, but they grew too strong
For my kinsmen this day became far too long
I lie in the open, waiting to die
Were all my life's beauty built on a lie?
My grace you shall get, because I welcome your return
(If) you're not the hidden into sadness I'll turn
I've come to your rescue now before your last breath
My love you will receive, but it will be your death
Fear not, said the mistress, the lady of light
Those who betrayed us would not stand the fright
Fusion Of Sense And Earth
Cosmos trembled
When it came to be
Fusion of sense and earth
In awe they looked
Those who feared the dark
At the enemy of hate
All menaces vanished
Conquered by will to live
Marched towards the shores
A war against the abnormal
The obstacles of peace
Victory for the light
"Wisdom and Chaos must unite
The Storm Will Linger On"
When fighting blindfolded
Every beast was possible to slay
No fortress guarded
When the serpents
Spat at the surface of the earth
It howled and laughed
Armoured with good will
Certain of victory
It fell to the ground
"Wisdom and Chaos must unite
The Storm Will Linger On"
Ruun
Have you ever seen beyond the reach?
Have you ever felt the change?
Visions from an altered state
They conceal and relevate
Communing once again with Gods
Thread unto the impossible path
Talking with a different tongue
Heralding the unsung
Reach for them, see them turn away
Have you ever seen beyond the reach?
Have you ever felt the change?
Visions from an altered state
They conceal and relevate
Fly away, chains undone
Reach for them, see them turn away
Doors open wide
Step into the light
No turning back
Embrace the night
Breathe eternities
We are not alone
Never to return
Merge with the unknown
Tides Of Chaos
I've got this twisted core
I've got this noose around my neck
That (just) won't let go
I've got this dream
In Which I kill you all
And there is no going back
They've choked the good in me
Sent me off to wander alone
Hateful, starving enemy of (your) order
Hunt you down, make you understand
No compassion for the enslavers of will
Your spite for reason makes me strong
Your lack of direction showed me where to go
We've come to share this destiny
No borders, no landmarks
Out in the open
I hold the key to the door
In vivid dreams while awake
I saw a way through
The agony of choice
In a Universe where the storms rage Endlessly
Time will never come to reinstate me
Mine is none
There was a day when I knew silence
Then came the tides of chaos
Washed it all away
I have seen what you have become
Smiling with evil intent
Betrayal between the lines
I have stepped outside the circle
Better off without
Choking on sand and sorrow
Visions from the suffocated
In this Universe where the fire roars Endlessly
Peace will never come to reconstruct me
Mine is gone
Essence
The question is this
By will alone
Does my heart carry the strength
To see you burn?
When I do not wish to part
To see them farewell
Does my heart carry the strength
To leave you behind?
The eternal search for purity
A fragile hope for the just and fair
Order feeds from the corpses
All beauty must die
Where is the essence
In beast or scripture?
Where lies the laws
In stars or temples?
I cannot see myself
Not your orbit
I cannot see the others
Not your eyes
It lasts forever when you let it go
Purity and Pain
Where is the essence
In beast or scripture?
Where lies the laws
In stars or temples?
I cannot see myself
Not your orbit
I cannot see the others
Not your eyes
If I told you I'd get you through
I'd have to let you fall down
Not because of malice
You needed to
And I'll remember
What we had
It lasts forever when you let it go
Purity and Pain
Api-vat
You lie there sleeping
Growing in my mind
A voice from eternity
Awaken now and guide me
Awaken now and guide me
Awaken now and guide me
He turns inward to see
"What might lie ahead?"
Seeing all, but nowhere
"Tell us, will we see the sun again?"
"Waiting is the cost of true vengeance"
Carrying the weight of knowing
"I see darkness, I see evil times"
Time to rise and stand tall again
"The ideals of the One"
I bow to the forefathers
"Towards the Father"
Feeling the transition
"The unity of dimensions"
Leave me not before all fear is gone
Pour into my veins
Let the father become the son,
And I'll keep walking through every winter
I'll keep on walking through every winter
I'll keep on walking through every winter
Heir To The Cosmic Seed
Behold the great evening star
As she once again gives birth
Behold the great evening star
As she once again destroys
Behold the shining wife
Of all the howling winds
She arrives when you despair
Behold the shining wife
Beware of what the self desires
She could smile if she removed
All glory from kings
Beware of the heir of cosmic fertility
Her splendour can cut you deep
Her eyes can burn the fields.
Ethica Odini
Reckless man - So righteous, so clean
Towards the light - So bashful, so pure
Who told you to abandon life
Your strength, free will
And bow for the light?
The light! And turn from the spinning wheel
Fear of the judgement!
Obey!
You have the key to mystery
Pick up the runes unveil and see
Judgement comes, before us lie
The paths of war and you may die
You have the key, cross over and see
The old and wind-cold tree
Walk the steps and you'll hear the winds that cry
Search beyond the blinded eyes
Listen before you preach
Don't leave yourself behind
Honorlife, when life has ceased
Welcome the dawn
Beware the glory tales
Watch their deeds - So just and fair
Crusaders - Appointed by God
Who told you step inside and preach?
Did you forget the daggers lurking in the dark?
Couldn't you listen or didn't you ever learn how?
Were you saved?
Were you saved, so you could slaughter with grace?
You have the key to mystery
Pick up the runes unveil and see
Judgement comes, before us lie
The paths of war and you may die
You have the key, cross over and see
The old and wind-cold tree
Walk the steps and you'll hear the winds that cry
Search beyond the blinded eyes
Listen before you preach
Don't leave yourself behind
Honorlife, when life has ceased
Welcome the dawn
Beware the glory tales
Hold on, don't fade away
Don't be afraid to bleed
Don't be afraid to dream
Let the elders enlighten the path
They have cried for you
They have died for you
Drasill - Ride on
Drasill - Ride on
Ride on

This journey without movement
Heading out for no-man's land
The way ahead my only ally
Early hours, in the silence
This credence keeps me upright
Through the storms and disasters
A straight line towards the unknown end
Deceit waits on the back roads
This unwavering inner
Keeps fear a welcomed pointer
I, uprooted, now the fertile soil
As plot and shadows thicken
This juggernaut cannot be stopped
On any scale or planet
Ghostly tracks in my wake and ahead
An experience, cannot be shared
Wheels of time
Keep them turning
Carriage of concepts
Circling the planes
Lightless voyage, blinding speeds
Certain I'll stay the distance
Abstract shapes, enigmatic design
I know enough to endure
Lightless corridors, ageless
Familiar
Alien
Contradictory engines run high
Deeper and further above
Journey of no promises
Beyond the lust for rewards
Focus on the movement of the Wheel
Union of stillness and change
Journey of the ages all
I'll follow outside the edge
Breath, blood, sacrifice and bleeding eyes
Unending journey ahead
Wheels of time
Keep them turning
Carriage of concepts
Circling the planes
Waruun
See them as they rise
From ancient sands - constructs
They're reaching everywhere and nowhere
As they're trampling on the archetypes
The listener warns
Tension... Pain... Fear... Violence
It reaches the limit set by
Ageless reason
Tension paints logic's hunts
Pain dances... (with justice)
Lies for the liar served without remorse
Like the gifts bring gifts
Altering view
Constant truth - drained of spirit
By own will
Waruun
Waruun - Drawn in the dust of morning
Waruun - The violence of the soul
Suicides upon the altars
Of evasion
Feared dissonance kept away - nails on stone
As darkness descends
Can't find our way out of here
Yet... It was built by you
Words on the trap-door
Waruun
Waruun - Drawn in the dust of morning
Waruun - The violence of the soul
Tension... Pain... Fear... Violence
How could freedom become the cage-maker?
What spoke to the mind-slayer?
The Beacon
To war!
Let the havoc be revenged
March!
Against the lords of perdition
Live!
Breathe!
Persecute the ones that left to persecute your soul
Crush the scepters of the kings and come and
Hail the vows of old!
Hear them cry
Watch them fly
Let them bow to the altars of suppression
Till you'll feel them die
Hear them cry
Watch them fly
The power and the free will they deny
Beyond the mist
Far above
On the highest peak
The beacon is lit
On the highest peak
The beacon will burn
How did I get this far?
How did it come to this?
Was my blood spilt in vain?
Did I survive, did I break the chains?
Was I ever alive?
Struggle through the wounds
Struggle through the fears
Struggle through the truths
You stand alone
Come through!
Release me!
Hear them cry
Watch them fly
Let them bow to the altars of suppression
Till you'll feel them die
Hear them cry
Watch them fly
The power and the free will they deny
Beyond the mist
Far above
On the highest peak
The beacon is lit
On the highest peak
The beacon will burn
I walked this far myself
My blood dripped from my knife
I awoke, and was alive
I did no longer weep
I saw my beacon, I ran to aid
Axioma
"Mind not the worshippers of punishment,
Un-growers and resisters"
Close your eyes, sense the below
Torment and separation points ahead
Set ablaze like steel through skin
"Fear not the settlement with those who fear the truth"
Leave now, bid farewell with no grief
Their words have no power
The forces will roam and return
Giants
No distance, no time
Endless void, absence of life
Chaos dwells outside the womb
Seduce, Invoke
Embrace, Give birth
See through the flesh
See past the soul
Feel the pulsating twilight
Domain of unborn thoughts
Go back, Unveil
Approach the cosmic womb
No smile without pain
No grief without laughter
Turn inwards, Realize
Witness the march of the Giants
-Soil and seed
Turn inwards, Gratify
Witness the storming of heaven
-Endless rebirth
Come nearer, Restless sin
Step into the core
They will welcome your return
Further in
Ride the storm one can't escape
Awake the Gods
Awake the Gods
Turn inwards, Realize
Witness the march of the Giants
-Soil and seed
Turn inwards, Gratify
Witness the storming of heaven
-Endless rebirth
Singular
Born into oblivion
Without the fear
-of existing all alone
Later comes the acquisition - forced upon
The solitude
Now loneliness
The god now submerged in a game of guilt
Psychopathic shepherds deny the miracle
-of our essence
...And yet we have part in the blame
Allowing their ravings,
Comforting their weakness, their sickness
It is time to
LIVE
TRUST
NO
ONE
Recognize black
Recognize white
Recognize shadows
I am with gods
...Black...White...Shadows...Gods
Recognize black
Recognize white
Recognize shadows
I am with gods
Traitors want to keep you down
Rise up from the ground
No-one steals what no-one owns
Disown and distance
Strong is she who realizes
Ethics built on sacrifice
No-one steals what no-one owns
One by one by one
Strong is she who realizes
Ethics built on sacrifice
No need for companionship
Back into the silence
It is all it needs
Desolation
Singular - Death - Birth
Singular - Birth - Death
Alone in birth
Alone in the darkness
Alone in death
Alone in the daylight
One with reality
Shaped by the inner glow
Determination - I
All can be reached from within
Born into oblivion
Without the fear
-of existing all alone
Later comes the acquisition - forced upon
The solitude
Now loneliness
The god now submerged in a game of guilt
Psychopathic shepherds deny the miracle
-of our essence
...And yet we have part in the blame
Allowing their ravings,
Comforting their weakness, their sickness
It is time to

Night-sight
I can see through the veil
Seeing all I need see
Nothing is hidden here
Deep into the woods
Casting
Letters that speak of...
All
Is all
Is naught
No-one but me
Knows of this place
Sanctuary
Where I construct
Dream while there is no strife
Anguish pulls no weight
One can see and the other is blind
Through the same pair of eyes
We have lost sight
Of the night-side of the self
Hunted by the fear
Of reunion
Night-sight is bliss
For he who dares look into
A world where you embrace the opposite
Where you are whole
There is no lasting joy
In numbness and dogma
Too much is too little in knowledge
Driven by mystery
We have lost sight
Of the night-side of the self
Hunted by the fear
Of reunion
Night-sight is bliss
For he who dares look into
A world where you embrace the opposite
Where you are whole
Lightening
I crossed the borders
The pain won't go away
For this treason, I want to see them ... Burn!
Hunt them down
Make them understand
The power I possess
I'll give you piece of mind
And freedom to search inside
I'll suffer for your souls
I cleaned the air
I slew death in your way
The hand of peace
All evil's great dismay
Hear the wheels turn
See the sky burns
For this treason, I want to see them... Burn!
Track them down
Bring them to silence
My will is the law
I'll bring you life and growth
And erase the memories of despair
I'll suffer for your needs
Don't you forget where your domain lies
Obey your slaves, with their feeble cries
We'll force you back if you linger here
We mock your strength, we see your fear
You'll never set a slave's mind free
Your bane is the grip of anxiety
At the ninth...
REID - Travel with no fear
REID - Remember to return
REID - Defy the laughing chaos
REID - Strike again
You fight the wars for your kin
You leave yourself behind
This settlement, you can't win
The inner eye is blind
I will clean the air
I know the pain will stay
I'll cross the border
I'll never fade away
For this treason, I want to see them... Burn!
Track them down
Bring them to silence
My will is the law
I'll bring you life and growth
And erase the memories of despair
I will linger on
Clouds
In the void of chaos life endures
In the gap of creation, the ancient wisdom breathes
Inheritance of fire
Inheritance of frost
Yet it lay there weeping
Afraid to see the light
Inheritance of fire
Inheritance of frost
No one comes to unveil
No one finds the key
Inheritance of fire
Inheritance of frost
Grasp the mighty chaos
Grasp the ancient birth
Seek deep within, feel the flames
Into the void, never to return
Seek deep within, fertilize
Into the void, rise...
Struggling against the fumes
Poisoning the hearts
Fighting the chains, to penetrate the clouds
Pulsating life in the ancient womb
Encapsulated in forces of old
Waiting to hear the call
To witness the cosmic marriage
Willing to blow to blow the mocking clouds away
To The Coast
To the coast, but not across
Static sanctuary
Longing for the heart of the changer
Chained to the past, a dream of liberation
The vultures above, they know, they've seen him linger here
Where the barren land meets sea the mother and the reaper
The irony of...
Sorrow kept close
Hanging head
Gaze upon the waters and turn back again
Like so many times before
Riders on the horizon with darkness in tow
Too painful to let go of the fear, too strong the ties
He came without a face
...And a promise of belonging
So I caved and gave way to this vision
Bleak and never-ending the pages
I'd like to see what lies beyond
Dissolving ink in salt water
Wrecked and laughing at the skies and the open sea
To the coast but not across
Had some strange days then walked back
To the coast but not across
Longing for the heart of the changer
Chained to the past, a dream of liberation
The vultures above, they know, they've seen him linger here
Where the barren land meets the sea the mother and the reaper
The irony of...
Riders on the horizon with darkness in tow
Too painful to let go of the fear, too strong the ties
He came without a face
...And a promise of belonging
So I caved and gave way to this vision
Bleak and never-ending the pages
I'd like to see what lies beyond
Dissolving ink in salt water
Wrecked and laughing at the skies and the open sea
Black clad back into the all over again
Ground
The defining sound
Fangs into flesh
Panic and spit
Death unto life
Eyes wide
It sees itself through the layers of ice
Now seal the cracks ... reject the notions!
Everything can not be happening on the inside?
An option not to listen
A nameless urge takes hold
Prey upon the weak
An aimless tale told
Pray upon the weak
Caught in a spiral of need
Act without the choice
Choose not to act
Caught in a spiral of need
Desperate and alone in a whole
Striving for higher ground
Carrying someone else's fears for tomorrow
Stay behind the line
Or eat from the bowels of reality
Grind the thorns to stardust
Gliding slowly across the abyss
Inside the inside the inside
There is a sound made by boiling blood
Above and below lay the levels
Above and below the ground
Ground
Vertebrae
"Abandoning the powers that gave them sight
Summoned to the altars of their loving gods"
Storming the walls, once built with pride
Swarming like rats away from the lights
Howling for justice, death in their eyes
Tearing down the pillars with monstrous hate
Forging the swords to slay their own kin
Screaming in triumph, burning inside
When the steps are fulfilled
We shall see a new dawn
When the dead world is gone
We shall rebuild the walls
When all the bricks from the morning
When they are once again found
We will emerge from the ashes
And rise from the ground
New Dawn
In the radiant night
Beneath the fertile soil
In every heart it lies sleeping
Hiding in dreams of strength
Older than the mountains
So ancient and profound
Beyond the grasp of reason
Above the laws of man
The ancient gods of battle
Summoned by the drums of war
In circles of fire descended
Our eyes and minds frantic
At the point of no return
I never saw her shine so bright
Returning the strength to a weary heart
Strife to reclaim and expand
A new dawn rises
Out from the shadows
A new dawn rises
I step unto the world
In times when truth has lost its valour
In times when fate is bought and sold
When honour lays slain at vanity's feet
It seemed like our last hour had come
The enemies' name outspoken
They will tremble upon seeing the sign
The second coming has no mercy
Forged in the flames with iron will
A new dawn rises
Out from the shadows
A new dawn rises
I step unto the world
Reflection
Clinging to life in the reflection of the self
Breathing the air from the poisoned pit
Hovering through flames from the burning core
Searching for reason in the ashes of men
Obeying the laws of the kings without lands
Bowing in awe at the hypocrite's feet
Not hearing the cry of the infant
Poisoning the seed that was planted within
Ignoring the winter that closes in
Believing the tales from the forked tongue
Frozen to death without being born
Looking for reason in the bottomless abyss
Clinging to life in the reflection of the self
Breathing the air from the poisoned pit
Hovering through flames from the burning core
Searching for reason in the ashes of men
Obeying the laws of the kings without lands
Bowing in awe at the hypocrite's feet
Clinging to life
Frozen to death
Clinging to life in the reflection of the self
Frozen to death without being born
Absorbing the reek of rotting Flesh
Marching in convoys to fields unknown
Clinging to life in the reflection of the self
Embracing the sun without casting shadows
Believing the tales from the forked tongue
Frozen to death without being born.
Center
Feel nothing
Oxen and primate as one
Pushing what already strives
(There is) no space
(There is) no peace
Let go of the whip
We've reached the outer limits of this orchestrated vision
Some might think it can't be kept apart
Forgot to ask: where are we in all of this?
Trying to get off track ... Into the wilderness
Running from the beast
In need of strength, in search of guidance
Asked but given nothing - remembering everything
It matters not now, it all came to fuel
Silent growth
Hoarse rust
Can not be broken
I trust the shapes
Heathen vertigo
Repaint the curses and bellow
Sailing past to old shores
In the distant haze
The waving motion
Is not for you
In every direction stretched and torn no more
(It) seems we've been here all along
The Watcher
Darkness...
Fear...
Life...
Cold...
Left alone with no will
Walking in footsteps of the fallen
Blinded by lack of reason
Indulging the tales of doom
...Farewell,
May the darkness bind them
No one will
Remember the pain when we are...
Desolate...
Unconscious...
Lost...
Where lays the ones I've slain?
Did I become any wiser?
Will their anger hunt me down?
Did I sacrifice in vain?
...Farewell,
Hear the sound of solitude
No one will
Walk the bridge, to darkness overcome
Settlement...
Trust...
Relief...
Dawn...
Guide me, watcher in the skies
Transform the forces of the dead
In my dreams I'll hunt them down
I now know the truth
Disintegrator
Separate
The frenzied infant
From mother
Her bosom bleeding
She needs sleep
Separate
The frenzied infant
From his mother
Her bosom bleeding
She needs sleep
Take him to the woods
Leave him there
The dogs will feast
The dogs will know him
Disintegrate
Disintegrate
Disintegrate
Disintegrate
Striker
From soar to plague
From clouds to imprisonment
From wheat to the gallows
In dreams of free will
Strike
Never saw fields
Quite like these
Never will Never would
With open eyes
Shut
Useless wreckage
In the wake
Cannot hear the chatter
Cannot bear the drag
Leave
When they saw
With what they were left
They screamed in fear
They screamed for blood
Endure
Should I build
I will build my own
Knife and noose
In flesh and will
Strike
Thoughts Like Hammers
Celestial buried mind resting
Resting without peace still
Don't know where I drowned
Cornered and defeated
Yes, there's a thought forming
Patterns in the currents
Mud-dwellers at the star-floor
Nourishment for the mind seeps
Harvest through suffering
Absorbed in desperation
Assimilated logic
Drawn towards the ladders
Elucidated, burned, afraid
Instinctive destruction sparked
Elucidated, burned, afraid
Knowing only my own dissent
Elucidated, burned, afraid
Static is the common language
Elucidated, burned, afraid
Celestial buried mind resting
Resting without peace still
Assimilated logic
Drawn towards the ladders
Elucidated, burned, afraid
Instinctive destruction sparked
Elucidated, burned, afraid
Knowing only my own dissent
Elucidated, burned, afraid
Static is the common language
Elucidated, burned, afraid
Motion remains our mothertongue
Failure might not be what it seems
All is broken for a reason
Familiar blood drawn for painting
Willing another perspective
Flashing scenes seeing children above
Knowing there will be another life
Sacrificing
Sacrificing remnants of the past
Walking all on my own forever
The illusion no longer needed
It is spoken without words of doubt
Now we move the stars above, below
And dwell beneath the layers of dirt
My runic patterns in the current
My runic patterns in the current
Motion remains our mothertongue
Failure might not be what it seems
All is broken for a reason
Familiar blood drawn for painting
Willing another perspective
Flashing scenes seeing children above
Death In The Eyes Of Dawn
The creation I can't remember
Unsecure I roam in fear
The final steps I've taken
What waits beyond this void?
"I sucked out your lifeblood
Tore down your fortress
Burned down the woods
I poisoned your harvest"
Trust and hope
I have lost
I see death
In the eyes of dawn
Deceit
Forged in the darkened depths of the womb
Seeds of betrayal planted in rotten soil
The ground swells
It's the end
I see the face
Of the dead god
Legions of the dead
Invading our realm
Forever deaf to the distant warning
Blinded are my eyes
Tied are my hands
Sleeping wide awake
Got lost within myself
I followed all the paths
Rigtheous in my heart
Slept without the dreams
Got lost within myself
When will I remember?
When will I hear the call?
When shall my forces gather?
When shall my battle begin?
"I've insulted your life since birth
You have never seen my true face
You failed to realize I'm your kin
I infected your mind when you smiled"
Awake!
The grip of anxiety
Shall strangle the brave no more
The son of earth and wind
Shall guide us in our wake
"You might hear the horn resound
You might summon back your king
As long as you love, I will hate
As long as you breed, I will kill"
Blinded are my eyes
Tied are my hands
Sleeping wide awake
Got lost within myself
I followed all the paths
Rigtheous in my heart
Slept without the dreams
Got lost within myself
Veilburner
Finding the truth doesn’t mean there’s an answer
Who would have thought? It seems worthless.
There’s no end to the travesty, idiocy,
It would seem I’ve arrived at the meeting point
Between then and now, a different place
The past alive, and the future is now
I can not tolerate being held in the dark
I need to see, I will the flames
Expanding light, from within a cube of darkness
I need to see, I will the flames
I found myself crawling, looking for an “out”
And made the gap no longer closed anymore
’cause my signs are burning, burning the veil
Killing our idols, scaring ourselves as well
Necessity, carer/killer
We’re all gonna see, we weren’t prepared
I can not tolerate being held in the dark
I need to see, I will the flames
Expanding light, from within a cube of darkness
I need to see, I will the flames
I found myself crawling, looking for an “out”
And made the gap no longer closed anymore
’cause my signs are burning, burning the veil
Killing our idols, scaring ourselves as well
Necessity, carer/killer
We’re all gonna see, we weren’t prepared
Grasping the liquid glass
Shaping my own sight
Staring at the sun
Absorbing death
Reach into the well
Where father laid his eye
Roots Of The Mountain
Approaching life
From the seeds of time
Cosmic pulse
Aeons of chaos
Feel the flames, the streams of life below
Feel the flames, that blind your inner eye
Seek and find, what lingers deep inside
Seek and find, but do not try to understand
Spread the wings, and fly into your mind
Spread the wings, and find the eagle in the sky
Find the source, the ancient passion play
Find the source, the roots of the mountain
Hark, men of faith
Where were you
When your children bled to death?
Listen, men of law
Where were you when the mothers were slain?
Feel the flames, the streams of life below
Feel the flames, that blind your inner eye
Seek and find, what lingers deep inside
Seek and find, but do not try to understand
Hark, men of faith
When you set fire to the fields,
The grass grew stronger
Listen, men of law
When you turned from life,
The flames endured
Leave order, the fiend of the earth
The self is all you've got
Enter life on the waves from the void
Behold the ancient roots
And the battles shall forever go on
With peace comes our certain doom
The mother will love as she hates
Where there is life, you will die
Approaching life
Aeons of chaos
Feel the flames, the streams of life below
Feel the flames, that blind your inner eye
Seek and find, what lingers deep inside
Seek and find, but do not try to understand
Spread the wings, and fly into your mind
Spread the wings, and find the eagle in the sky
Find the source, the ancient passion play
Find the source, the roots of the mountain
RIITIIR
Your arms, life and death
Ride the chariot, the wheel of life
Underneath the eyes we pray
Seven horses running in circles until the end of days
Above the wonders of man, sailing the cosmic seas
Risen from the darkness to rule the ancient world
Never to return, the eyes will forever shine on
Omniscient, glorious - the all seeing eye
Malign, burning grace
All rise! The seeds you will bring
Sons of man, bow in awe
Omnipotent, Lumina Titan
In the havens you greeted us
Late is the hour you submerge
Endless travel towards the dawn
Hail the flames inside you, cosmic flowers in bloom
Hail the spears impaling, the servants of doom
Given are the truths, together we shall search
Unveiling the riddles, hidden beneath the stones
Left is an ancient entity
Ready to sacrifice, what we may (have) achieved
Ending a journey with no end
Defying the ones drowned in salvation
Letting the forces roam free
A circle fulfilled
Materal
See her cruel beauty
Hostile to the constants
Ever changing scourge
Ashen thrones
Converge upon me
Come winds of destruction
Electrocute the stale
Purify
Thaw! False ice to water
Speak! Sharp tongues sever sick limbs
Numb! Do not look away
Opt! Permanent particles
Curtains be unshut
Old wounds opened and bled
Wishes laid to rest
Ashen hopes
Reflections of truth
Drops of eternity
Instances captured
Clarify
Etch! New shapes will emerge
Need! Reaching into the dark
Owe! I opened the gates
Roar! O', devourer of time
There's this chamber
Randomly placed in time and space
Echo chamber
Achievable dream
Capacitate
Heuristic observers might find
Ends to the means
Rain is less scarce there
You heeded my call - now read my signs
And chose to follow
Dominate slavelessly
Enter my thoughts,
And walk with me throughout these barren lands
Aligning wordlessly
Tell me my own story,
Through the inner and nether worlds
Healing accordingly
Into the night side, irreversible and remorseless
Slaughterous and reborn
Hagalaz!
End the charade!
Return to the wombs
A funeral lost
Baptize the faceless
Light up the beacons
End the hunt for truth!
Time to break it down
Owe nothing to trees
Nullify the past
Enter the maternal fires
Entropy
Deter rot within the roots
Nourisher
Old fears no longer controls
Negation
Enter maternal fires
Xiphoid dreams
I close the gate!
Silence the voices
Take to heart the fear
And nourish the pain
Nothing can hurt us
Called upon the mare
Ended the sham reign
These forces in tow
Endlessness opens
Ashen memories
Retain the images
In need of her strength
Time changes
Death is encountered
Over and over again
Worship her pyres
Navigate
Storm Of Memories
In the land described as the beyond
In lack of better directional insight
Something stirs and leaps
Casual roads of reason intersect
Conceptual wormholes in the lawless black
In ancient matter
Unknown kin, as they thoroughfare
Unexplored utopia lineage
Accumulation
Icebergs of the abyss never melts
Ideal energy, it's building within
Unlike loyalty
Cadaverous and spirited I work
Composite and uniform I sacrifice
Resist the wisdom
With limited perception we see
We learn, and we laugh, and we sleep,
And we watch
Logic is worthless
Storm of the ions, ecstatic mind
Seeps through the cracks, it fills up the bones
I remember now
The here and the now - it is nothing
...This Eve - haunted by a storm of memories
Immortality
Then it was quiet, then it was dark
Trees, dreams, and the runes
Makes for a future
I'm on the inside
Looking at the sky, I think of you
Life is a room, in between the greater halls
There we'll met again
I can't make out what is what is what
In this storm of memories
Now it all comes back
I know there's strength in my blood
I can hear the past
Fearing not
Time has come... listen
There's a storm
Within
Storm of the ions, ecstatic mind
Seeps through the cracks, it fills up the bones
I remember now
The here and the now - it is nothing
...This Eve - haunted by a storm of memories
Immortality
Then it was quiet, then it was dark
Trees, dreams, and the runes
Makes for a future
I'm on the inside
Looking at the sky, I think of you
Life is a room, in between the greater halls
There we'll met again
Unknown kin, as they thoroughfare
Unexplored utopia lineage
Accumulation
Icebergs of the abyss never melts
Ideal energy, it's building within
Unlike loyalty
Cadaverous and spirited I work
Composite and uniform I sacrifice
Resist the wisdom
With limited perception we see
We learn, and we laugh, and we sleep,
And we watch
Logic is worthless
Forsaken
Forsaken
Entombed in monumental self-moral
Embracing the absurd
Reason turned to abstraction
Drowned in the shallowest of waters
Forgotten the will
To learn
Abandoned every urge to
Create
Every border can be breached
By the glorious armies of united perfection
Marching forth
Aiming low
A thirst to kill
Defending the nothingness
Forsaken
The unborn learns to hate
Navigation towards destruction
Letting our ideals slowly rot
And thus...
Thus we choose
To die...
Die with pride
And innocence...
We became the heralds
Born and raised to preach
And to erase all traces
Of the abstract and evil
Swords...
Temples...
Fires...
Doom...
We failed to see what we fed
The serpent of the deeps
It grew and strangled the truths
We were embracing the lies
We once could see its eyes
The stare of death and deceit
We feared not, the secrets we knew
The guardian of the deeps
Lost...
And the darkness will prevail
Forever...
Folding hands with clouded sight
Ceremonial rituals will obscure the mind
Forever...
Lost...
And turning blossom to decay
Forever...
Fighting wars with clouded sight
Ceremonial rituals will obscure the mind
Forever...
One Thousand Years of Rain
The age of the wolf is the age of the sword
Son of the earth, father of despair, lurking
And ever searching to end his thirst
Strength reborn in the streams of cold blood
Son of the earth, father of rage, hiding beneath
And ever smiling when the seed is planted
Hate paving the streets of gold
Long gone is the golden grace
Feeble beats from a frozen heart
Now glowing eyes in the pale face
The blind man cries in vain
Long gone is the light of day
Searching the borders of sanity
The children of tomorrow they slay
Their spirits entombed in rotten soil
Son of the earth, father of anxiety, amongst us
And ever telling the tales of the righteous
Licking drops of sorrow from the lake of tears
Son of the earth, father of treason, envy the beauty
And ever embracing the desperation
Hiding from the moonbeams, afraid to face the wrath
Wandering down the icy path
The sun is dying
The mother is crying
No sadness found in the jester’s face
The sun is dying
The mother is crying
Long gone is the golden grace
Feeble beats from a frozen heart
Now glowing eyes in the pale face
The blind man cries in vain
Long gone is the light of day
Searching the borders of sanity
The children of tomorrow they slay
Their spirits entombed in rotten soil
The winter is closing in
Like the grip of a war within
Absence of light turning flesh to stone
A cosmic war and you stand alone
Brother killing brother
Tales of honor becoming myth
History written with axes and blood
The wolf is howling at the gate

Silent tears won’t bring him back
No sadness found in the jester’s face
The mother is crying
Breach the walls, relieve the pain, or be left in one thousand years of rain
Ægirs armar
Immigrant Song
Ahhh-ah-ah! Ahhh-ah-ah!
We come from the land of the ice and snow
From the midnight sun where the hot springs blow
Hammer of the gods will drive our ships to new lands
To fight the horde and sing and cry
Valhalla, I am coming
On we sweep with the threshing oar
Our only goal will be the western shore
Ahhh-ah-ah! Ahhh-ah-ah!
We come from the land of the ice and snow
From the midnight sun where the hot springs blow
How soft your fields so green can whisper tales of gore
Of how we calmed the tides of war
We are your overlords
On we sweep with the threshing oar
Our only goal will be the western shore
So now you'd better stop and rebuild all your ruins
For peace and trust can win the day despite of all your losing
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-oohThe Sacrifice
We had always known them
The southern cult of the white one
Who came with swords
Under a banner of peace
My cousin, lord of the wolves,
Welcomed them into our lands
In the spirit of prosperity
We watched as our temples were enshackled
Imprisoned behind cathedral walls
Until we could bear their prattle no longer
We would protect our temples,
Our very way of life,
With a pact: an oath of law
And so we crossed the wave-road
To meet with them in peace
But they betrayed us
And as my lord ran into battle
I heard him speak his final words:
“Surrounded, outnumbered, five hundred to one
Tonight, I will see the gates of Valhalla!”
The Blood Of Many
Pushing the lines of my brothers
Charging on into the fray
The sweat and the mud and the smell of the blood
Carry me on to a tale of history
Surrounded, outnumbered, five hundred to one
We’ll taste of defeat on this day
By the will and the glory of Thor’s iron hammer
Carry me on to a tale of victory
Surrounded, outnumbered, no hope of retreat
The brothers will lay in the dirt
Blade slash, blood splash, move past, war!
Killing for glory, my place by the king
To hallow the hall of Valhalla
Blade slash, blood splash, kill fast, war!
I run into battle engorged with the rage
I’ll kill many men on this day
Bringing destruction, the dance of the brothers
In the frenzy of our final melee
My blade and my hammer, my tooth and my nail
Are tasting the blood of many!
Swinging the hammer, thrusting the blade
My enemies fall to the dirt
Blade slash, blood splash, kill fast, war!
Killing for glory to bathe in their entrails
And wade through the blood of many!
Move past, kill fast, world smashed, blood bath!
I have fallen
Who knows when I was struck?
My face swells with pain
And my tongue rings with the tang of blood
As I rise I see the field
Is covered with the carrion bird
Above, the ravens peer down
Circling the front line of battle
I have been resting it seems
While my brothers are fighting on
I am not done yet!
I have not yet earned my place!
I have no honour!
I have not earned my stay in Valhalla!
As I take to foot
Wading through the bodies
Of my enemies and my brothers
I’m reminded of the tale of Ragnarok
The greatest of all wars!
I’ll fight!
I run into battle unable to see
Blinded by the blood of many
By the will and the glory of Thor’s golden hammer
Carry me on to a tale of history
Surrounded, outnumbered, I know my defeat
I’m wasted against this foe
By my wife and my family, my son and my homeland
I cannot allow victory!
Surrounded outnumbered no hope of retreat
The brothers now lay in the dirt
Move fast, blade slash, blood splash
Killing for glory, my place by the king
To hallow the hall of Valhalla
Move fast, kill fast, until the last is defeated!
The blood of many, the blood of many, the blood of many, war!
Endless Horizon
We are wandering warriors on the waves
In the cold northern fjordlands
We’re coming to your homelands on the sea
With his eye on our side
Odin, king of the Aesir, guides our hearts
On the path to Valhalla
With shimmering swords and brightly shining spears
We will conquer your kind
So we ride on the endless horizon
Yes, we sail to take what we need.
We will ride on the endless horizon
We sail across the sea
Turn the sail hard to port!
So we ride on the endless horizon
Yes, we sail to take what we need.
We will ride on the endless horizon
We sail across the sea
We leave your town in ashes and in flames
Proud to have been your foes
We conquered all your kindred and your homes
And taken all that we need
We’re sailing on to a new horizon
Endlessly we shall go
Ahti, guide our ship to safety and to our next victory
We will ride on the endless horizon
Yes, we sail on to victory!
We will ride on the endless horizon
Valhalla calls to me!
I the viking warrior!
I the motherless son!
I the slayer of families
Why? I have no one!
I the wandering warrior!
I the unstoppable foe!
I will burn and pillage
Why? I have no home!
Why?
Saga Of The Winterborn Part I: Lord Of The Wolves
My cousin was the lord
Of these islands of the sun
The farthest south that we had come
And there we met our fiercest foe
The Christians, they were called,
Denied our gods and our heroes
Denied our legends and our history
They denied Baldur, Odin’s son
We could not bear it, could not allow
The south to rise up and thrust us out
We’ll send them back to their homes
To the city of Rome
My cousin, Lord of the Wolves
Went to the south to face his enemy
But they betrayed him with an army
The biggest one I’ve ever seen!
He sent me to the North
To the lands of our fathers
To represent our southern homeland
To the Kingdom of dragon’s fire
For fifteen years we have sought you
The Winterborn, I’ve heard you called
The fiercest of warriors
In these islands, you’ll rule them all
And boldly they went across the sea
To the place they knew they would find the Winterborn
For fifteen years they had sought the boy
And when at last they found him
They raised their blades up to Odin
You see your father was a hero
He was a king amongst his men
And he was slaughtered by the Christians
You must avenge him my cousin’s son.
For fifteen years we have sought you
Just awaiting for this day
We will not back down, cannot allow
The tale to end this way
As I continue my quest
I am confident that I will find you
You are the Son of the North
And the King of my people
Yes I have rallied from the North
Ten thousand men to drive them out
Yes, we will burn all the churches
In these islands of the sun
You see your father was a hero
He was a king amongst his men
And he was slaughtered by the Christians
You must avenge him my cousin’s son.
For fifteen years we have sought you
Just awaiting for this day
We will not back down, cannot allow
The tale of Winterborn to end this way
Saga Of The Winterborn Part II: Dirge Of Winterborn
Been many days since he departed from this shore
That snow white smile, those ice blue eyes
His child is in me, a mother I may be
To a child of winter, born to sail the sea
Been many weeks now, he left on a Drekkar
With a loathsome dragon, on its prow
He’s called a hero, a king amongst his men
From mortal foes by his blade or life he’ll defend
And I wonder where he may be
And I wonder when he’ll come home to me
Been many months now since I’ve seen his gentle face
That snow white smile, those ice blue eyes
And when I see him, a raging I will be
“Where have you been, did you care that you worried me?”
It’s been so long now since I’ve heard his gentle voice
He used to sing me lullabies
His son’s delivered from my womb’s clutching embrace
Will he ever see him? will he ever know his face?
I begin to believe I never will again
I begin to understand he is gone
Winterborn, I know I can’t go on
My heart is broken and I will surely die!
Winterborn, I give you to the night
And now you’ll either learn to fight or die alone!
Winterborn, there is no turning back
Your father’s gone and I have died
Winterborn, I give you to the North,
You’ll become the best of us or die alone…
And I wonder where you may go…
Saga Of The Winterborn Part III: Son Of The North
What it means to be a warrior
To sail the seas and conquer foes
Hold your head high, blades pointed to the sky
It is within you to drive them out
I will not back down
I cannot allow
The south to rise up
And thrust us out
To be a hero, you must know
The eye of Odin will not touch your foes
So do not back down from any foe you face
Leave none behind you that stand in your way
I will not back down
I cannot allow
The south to rise up
And thrust us out
Come with me across the sea, me boy
Adventure awaits!
The viking warriors
In the islands of the south
With bloody weapons and angry eyes
We drive the enemy out
With confidence in out hearts
Blades pointed to the sky
No one can defeat us, my lad
Though many of us may die
To be a warrior
Takes everything you’ve got
Our hearts cry out for victory
Our rage is burning hot!
Valhalla calls to us!
Odin waits on high!
Praise to Mjolnr, never stop!
Leave no one left alive!
What does it mean to be a warrior?
Come with me to the land of our foes
Your father’s gone, your mother, she is dead
The Son of the North will have revenge
My cousin, Lord of the Wolves
Come to the south and face our enemy
We will betray them with an army
The biggest one they’ve ever seen!
You see you see your father was a hero
He was a king amongst his men
And he was slaughtered by the Christians
You must avenge him my cousin’s son
Fifteen long years we have sought you
Just awaiting for this day
We sail for days across the ocean
To land in this hidden bay
The Hall At The End Of The Earth
After the journey is over
And the trails have all come to an end
At the end of years, there’ll be no more fears
Only a ship sailing off into the clear
After this life is over
In a hall at the end of the earth
They will serve to you the finest brew
A mead twice as cool as morning dew
Long have I sought in search of respite,
For the hall at the end of the earth
I first heard the tale on the darkest of nights
When my fears denied my worth.
In a crashing thunderstorm,
I thrashed upon the rocks.
I sank into the water, then
I thought that I was lost,
Alone on the sea
My heart was in doubt
I saw the kings of warriors
I heard them singing out!
I sailed for a year and a day with those men
The price I had paid for my life.
I’d all but forgotten the song I had heard
In the blackest of my darkest nights.
Then there came a day,
The wand’rer came my way
He wore a cloak and an ashen beard
And these words I heard him say
“Kindly show the way,
To an old man in decay,
Your life is all but over now,
You and I must not delay!”
Do you know the way to the hidden valley?
Long is the way that we must go!
Over the waves and the wat’rey alleys,
There they brew the finest mead I know!
And on the third day we set out from port,
The old man disappeared
That night, the sun went down beyond the edge of the sea
Never to rise up again.
For nine long weary nights
We tumbled without day
Until one morn we saw the light
Of the glittering Bifrost way
Standing on the rocks
As we could plainly see
Was Heimdall, lord of the sky-mountain
Staring down at me!
The figure rose out of the mist
With eyes that burned like fire
He raised his blade to the sky
And this is what he said:
“You must go over the great rainbow bridge, my new friends, into the city of Asgard! There you will find the golden hall you seek, and Odin, king of the Aesir!”
We had come to our final destination!
To the great walled city of the Gods!
We raised our blades up to Odin, the king!
To Asgard, and the great Valhalla!
But at the end of the day,
The wanderer came our way
And said, “Don these holy instruments
And let these bastards here you play!
For there will come a day
When everything will die
The Fenris Wolf and the World Serpent
Will hear this joyous cry!”
Do you know the way to the hidden valley?
Long is the way that we must go!
Over the waves and the wat’rey alleys,
There they brew the finest mead I know!The Forlorn Knight
Following Avon's crystal path
I pass'd by Warwick by chance
Where I came across a mansion
Standing gauntly on a low bluff...
He was brave and he was bold
He was in love with the daughter of his lord
She would not have him
She would not care
So he went afar to win her hand...
Germania's rose he set free
And put Saracens to the sword
He laid low monstrous beasts
Yet love he did not win...
He faced the Danes
And saved the day-King Athelstan
Did praise his name...
But bereft of love
He turned to god
And shut himself away from men...
Then I awoke and realized
I had slept in his death-bed...
The Purest Breed
Summer's breeze blowing through their mane
Wild horses of the purest breed! Ride!
Onward to battle, onwards like the wind
Cozak warriors of the purest breed! Hail!
Spurs to the side, a lash of the reins
Foam in the mouth, A' glistening the eye...
Bloodlust is nigh, for a rider and steed
Alike as they ride, pressing to the fight!
The banners are high and so's the battle cry,
The trampling of hooves of the purest breed! Ride!
Onwards to battle, onwards like the wind
Cozak warriors of the purest breed! Hail!
Spurs to the side, a lash of the reins
Foam in the mouth, A' glistening the eye...
Bloodlust is nigh, for a rider and steed
Alike as they ride, pressing to the fight!
Wild horses of the purest breed
Born to the steppes defiant to the cold
Cozak warriors of the purest breed
Loyal to the Czar, they defy death!
Summer's breeze blowing through their mane
wild horses of the purest breed! Ride!
Onward to battle, onwards like the wind
Cozak warriors of the purest breed! Hail!
Sleipnir
Sleipnir! Sleipnir!
O'er lofty mountains-Ride now!
Passing swiftly
Like a gust
Of deadly wind
A fate to seal
Son of Loki and Svadilfari
Take me where my brothers fell!
To Asbyrgi I'll make my stand
I'll fight and die upon your back!
Sleipnir!
Steed of Odin!
Hark!
The horn of Heimdall calls!
Lead the Gods to one last war
Against the Giants' fearsome host!
Over sea and through the air
To and fro the Underworld
Sleipnir! Sleipnir!
Rune-carved teeth bared in a neigh
That shakes the earth
And brings down the Thunder!
What Glory Remains
Oft I have seen
Many a brilliant star to fade
And night came creeping in to usurp that once shinning place... Long ago I was
a mariner
A viking conqueror... I sailed far with Erik the Red
And a hundred brave men!
What glory remains
Of these ancient days?
What songs will be sung
In the days to come?
Under hostile skies I have slept
On the heardrest of the sword
And dreamt of past glories long
Now gone forevermore...
I saw the fire that burns within
The mystic caverns of Thule
I journeyed to a world forlorn
Where shades weep forevermore...
Blackened by dragon's breath
Under arrows I have dreamt
Of the billows that caress
The shores of home again and again...
What glory remains
Of the ancient days?
What songs will be sung
in the days and years to come?
Alas!
I've grown too old
And my days are numbered...
I neither have the strength
Nor fire that I once did...
Dawn In Tir Na N'og
Clouds lined with silver
Soon to be parted
By the spear of lough
The dawn draws nigh... Tuatha de Danann
Awake! Seize the day!
A new sun doth rise
O'er Tir Na N'Og... sing me the song
My heart's yearning for
Play now the tune
That would bring me back
Back to your ring
There to dance with thee
And see the day break
In the otherworld!
Follow the sidhe through the lake
Icy waters flanked by hills so green
Unravel a path of mystical sheen
To undying lands let me now awake
Guardian at the gates
Of Tir Na N'Og
I fear now your sword!
Stand back, let me pass to the lands of my folk!
The Will Of Odin
Stars a glimmer in a valley sheer
Steel is drawn and shines in moonlight
The heavens quake then pour heavy rain
Thunders announce the bloody battle's eve...
The wheel of the sun is carved on my shield
And so are the runes of Thor on my sword!
Odin's blood has blessed my spear
Invincible I am
Dare stand in my path!
We crossed the sea in a dragon-ship
We braved the fury of the waves
We've come here for war, we bring woe
Fires that shall burn high and rise to the sky!
Odin ride forever by our side
Thy will is grim but it will be done!
Tyr embrace in thy might your sons
Freyja weave thy spell of magic...
The wheel of the sun is carved on my shield
And so are the runes of Thor on my sword!
Odin's blood has blessed my spear
Invincible I am
Dare stand in my path!
Father Of Victory
Father of victory
My life I lay down to thee
Steep me in majesty
And forth send thy Valkyries!
Father of victory
My sword I offered unto thee
Crown me for eternity
In Valhalla now welcome me!
Father of victory
Behold! Your true son am i
As einherjer I stand
In your honor for to fight!
Father of victory
Thou who reings supreme
Ride wild a hunting O'er fires on the battlefield
Charles Martel
Charles Martel, the day will come again
I'll see you lead the cavalry to charge!
Charles Martel, in the battle of Ambleve
You dyed Malmedy blood-red!
Tours recall the glory of your hosts
Thy fame is sung on harps with golden strings!
The crescent moon you drove back to the sea
Once and for all...
And when the sound of battle horns
Shall keenly fill the air anon
We'll rise with pride our banner high
And answer to our king's call!
Charles Martel, the day will come again
I'll see you lead the cavalry to chrage!
Charles Martel, in the battle of Ambleve
You dyed Malmedy blood-red!
Tours recall the glory of your hosts
Thy fame is sung on harps with golden strings!
The crescent moon you drove back to the sea
Once and for all...
Even when the horns of war
Shall echo in the fields no more
When in tatters hangs our flag
And empty be the throne of Franks
We'll still keep watch by night to see
Charles Marterl return again!
Rest now my king but light be thy sleep
Thy foes still covet thy crown...
Charles Martel, the day will come again
I'll see you lead the cavalry to chrage!
Charles Martel, in the battle of Ambleve
You dyed Malmedy blood-red!
Tours recall the glory of your hosts
Thy fame is sung on harps with golden strings!
The crescent moon you drove back to the sea
Once and for all...
Wallachian Warlord
The land beyond the forest
Where rusalky and domovye lurk
Is held under the spell
Of Vlad's sovereign stare...
Vampiric dusk now bleeds the sky
And the virgin dawn aghast will find
The boyar traitors impaled on a spike
In the shadow of Targoviste's spires...
Stand fast their hordes are come!
Bound to the dragon by oath of blood
Sword unsheathed, forth rode the rince
To drive the Ottoman wolves to the sea!
Broadswords of scimitars
The wild music of steel on steel
Yet Targoviste falls alas!
60000 dogs prowl the land
A curse on Corvinus, the sultan and Radu
Who thought that prison walls could keep a hero bound
In 1476 Wallachia welcomed backed her son
Placing on his shoulders the royal mantle of black legacy!
Stand fast their hordes are come!
Bound to the dragon by oath of blood
Sword unsheathed, forth rode the prince
To drive the Ottoman wolves to the sea!
The Iron Wolf
In the days of yore
The royal hunt was on
Loud bayed the hounds
As Gediminas set forth
In the holy woods
Of old Sventaragis
He laid down to rest
Beneath an ancient oak
And dreamt as only dream
The men who would be kings!
He saw the iron wolf
Ride monstrous on the hill
He heard the iron wolf
Howl like hundreds of it's kin!
Tearing from the veils of sleep
His heart was a wild drumbeat
He sought the counsel of the gods
Through Lizdeika's wise words:
"What is destined for thee, let it be!
Great Duke, unite thy people and be king!"
Fear not the iron wolf
He shall be thy fort!
And in him shall dwell
All the rulers of thy line
And the glory of their deeds
Shall resound like wolf-song
Thoughout the ancient world!
Heroes In The Sky
At last the flaming arrows
Fall like heavy rain upon me
And I am sailing towards
The vastness of the endless sky...
In Valhalla I will dine tonight
Like all heroes in the sky!
In my dreams, a Valkyrie
To take me to the sky!
There is no death tonight
I'm a hero in the sky!
Don't let my mother cry
I'm a hero in the sky
When the enemy spears
Formed lines full of thorns
I fell without a tear
I lived and died by the sword
In Valhalla I will dine tonight
Like all heroes in the sky!
In my dreams, a Valkyrie
To take me to the sky!
There is no death tonight
I'm a hero in the sky!
Don't let my mother cry
I'm a hero in the sky
Red on white across the vale
Blood on the snow is spilled
My battlecry did win the day
By my hand a king was killed!
In Valhalla I will dine tonight
Like all heroes in the sky!
In my dreams, a Valkyrie
To take me to the sky!
There is no death tonight
I'm a hero in the sky!
Don't let my mother cry
I'm a hero in the sky
Carmina Bellica
Upon the pinions of the wind
A call is carried forth
And sets our banners high
Fills our hearts with pride!
Swear the warrior's oath
On the shrine of the war-god
Carve runes upon your sword
And enemy hearts alike!
Songs of war signs my sword
Sound the charge we go to war!
Songs of war and glories old
Shall be rsung in our halls!
We stand beleaguered by foes and fire
Courage still in our eyes
Phalanx, hold the line!
Men of Hyperborea
Your time is come to ride
Lo! Your grim gods are aligned
Pon the ramparts of the sky!
Songs of war signs my sword
Sound the charge we go to war!
Songs of war and glories old
Shall be rsung in our halls!
"Show them Hyperborean might
O pride of the empire!
Today the field shall be thine
Bring them to their knees!
Crush their idols to the ground
Ride their armies down!
Let us take up the cry: Vae Victis!"
In An Emerald Garden
Come my love, we'll leave this here land-
I'll take you far by paths no mortal knows
In an emerald garden, under new-born stars
And there my love we could be as once before...
I'll make you a gown of lilies and pearls
To wear on the day we exchange vows
In an emerald garden, under an azure sky,
There my dear child we could love as before...
Warrior Heart
He who alone faces thousands,
He who stands when all kneel,
He who walks where few dare,
He whose voice speaks the truth...
Is a true man of honor,
A spirit unbowed;
And in his chest is a'pounding
A warrior's heart!
He who holds virtue sacred,
He who loves the Fatherland,
He who fights for his people,
He who surrenders to none...
Is a true man of honor,
A spirit unbowed;
And in his chest is a'pounding
A warrior's heart!
He whose soul has no price,
He whose eyes are not dark,
He whose sword brings justice,
He whose name is put to song...
Is a true man of honor,
A spirit unbowed;
And in his chest is a'pounding
A warrior's heart!
The Purest Breed
Summer's breeze blowing through their mane
Wild horses of the purest breed! Ride!
Onward to battle, onwards like the wind
Cozak warriors of the purest breed! Hail!
Spurs to the side, a lash of the reins
Foam in the mouth, A' glistening the eye...
Bloodlust is nigh, for a rider and steed
Alike as they ride, pressing to the fight!
The banners are high and so's the battle cry,
The trampling of hooves of the purest breed! Ride!
Onwards to battle, onwards like the wind
Cozak warriors of the purest breed! Hail!
Spurs to the side, a lash of the reins
Foam in the mouth, A' glistening the eye...
Bloodlust is nigh, for a rider and steed
Alike as they ride, pressing to the fight!
Wild horses of the purest breed
Born to the steppes defiant to the cold
Cozak warriors of the purest breed
Loyal to the Czar, they defy death!
Summer's breeze blowing through their mane
wild horses of the purest breed! Ride!
Onward to battle, onwards like the wind
Cozak warriors of the purest breed! Hail!
Father Of Victory
Father of victory
My life I lay down to thee
Steep me in majesty
And forth send thy Valkyries!
Father of victory
My sword I offered unto thee
Crown me for eternity
In Valhalla now welcome me!
Father of victory
Behold! Your true son am i
As einherjer I stand
In your honor for to fight!
Father of victory
Thou who reigns supreme
Ride wild a hunting
O'er fires on the battlefield
The Iron Wolf
In the days of yore
The royal hunt was on:
As Gediminas set forth;
In the holy woods
Of old Sventaragis
He laid down to rest
Beneath an ancient oak
And dreamt as only dream
The men who would be kings!
He saw the iron wolf
Rise monstrous on the hill:
He heard the iron wolf
Howl like hundreds of its kin!
Tearing from the veils of sleep,
His hear was a wild drumbeat-
He sought the counsel of the Gods
Through Lizdeika's wise words;
"What is destined for thee, let it be!
Great Duke, unite thy people and be king!"
Fear not the iron wolf-
He shall be thy fort!
And in him shall dwell
All the rulers of thy line
And the glory of their deeds
Shall resound like wolf-song
Thoughout the ancient world!
Remember Hastings
No paler a star than Luna herself
Arose beside Venus when night settled in;
The eye of the heavens o'er Hastings beholds
The Norman and the Saxon lying side by side,
Drenched in red blood, still clinging to their swords,
They fought for the dominion of Albion's lands.
Yet who proved the strongest, hardly a man can tell;
Whose God prevailed? Christ or the Old Faith?
The days shall come, the nights shall pass
And the grass will grow on the mounds, alas!
The wind laments across Hastings' vale,
It still remembers the sound of swords being crossed,
The poignant yells the sound of fury, the fire and the blood!
And though centuries may pass,
And tall on Hastings grow the grass,
Remember that terrible day of swords,
Remember the warriors whose lives were lost-
Remember Hastings and shed a tear for it's ghost!
The Will Of Odin
Stars a' glimmer in a valley sheer,
Steel is drawn and shines in moonlight
The heavens quake then pour heavy rain
Thunders announce the bloody battle's eve...
The wheel of the sun is carved on my shield
And so are the runes of Thor on my sword!
Odin's blood has blessed my spear
Invincible I am
Dare stand in my path!
We crossed the sea in a dragon-ship
We braved the fury of the waves
We've come here for war, we bring woe
Fires that shall burn high and rise to the sky!
Odin ride forever by our side
Thy will is grim but it will be done!
Tyr embrace in thy might your sons
Freyja weave thy spell of magic...
The wheel of the sun is carved on my shield
And so are the runes of Thor on my sword!
Odin's blood has blessed my spear
Invincible I am
Dare stand in my path!
What Glory Remains
Oft I have seen
Many a brilliant star to fade
And night came creeping in to usurp that once shinning place... Long ago I was
a mariner
A viking conqueror... I sailed far with Erik the Red
And a hundred brave men!
What glory remains
Of these ancient days?
What songs will be sung
In the days to come?
Under hostile skies I have slept
On the heardrest of the sword
And dreamt of past glories long
Now gone forevermore...
I saw the fire that burns within
The mystic caverns of Thule
I journeyed to a world forlorn
Where shades weep forevermore...
Blackened by dragon's breath
Under arrows I have dreamt
Of the billows that caress
The shores of home again and again...
What glory remains
Of the ancient days?
What songs will be sung
in the days and years to come?
Alas!
I've grown too old
And my days are numbered...
I neither have the strength
Nor fire that I once did...
The Forlorn Knight
Following Avon's crystal path
I pass'd by Warwick by chance
Where I came across a mansion
Standing gauntly on a low bluff...
He was brave and he was bold
He was in love with the daughter of his lord
She would not have him
She would not care
So he went afar to win her hand...
Germania's rose he set free
And put Saracens to the sword
He laid low monstrous beasts
Yet love he did not win...
He faced the Danes
And saved the day-King Athelstan
Did praise his name...
But bereft of love
He turned to god
And shut himself away from men...
Then I awoke and realized
I had slept in his death-bed...
Charles Martel
Charles Martel, the day will come again
I'll see you lead the cavalry to charge!
Charles Martel, in the battle of Ambleve
You dyed Malmedy blood-red!
Tours recall the glory of your hosts
Thy fame is sung on harps with golden strings!
The crescent moon you drove back to the sea
Once and for all...
Ans when the sound of battle horns
Shall keenly fill the air anon
We'll rise with pride our banner high
And answer to our king's call!
Charles Martel, the day will come again
I'll see you lead the cavalry to charge!
Charles Martel, in the battle of Ambleve
You dyed Malmedy blood-red!
Tours recall the glory of your hosts
Thy fame is sung on harps with golden strings!
The crescent moon you drove back to the sea
Once and for all...
Even when the horns of war
Shall echo in the fields no more
When in tatters hangs our flag
And empty be the throne of Franks
We'll still keep watch by night to see
Charles Marterl return again!
Rest now my king but light be thy sleep
Thy foes still covet thy crown...
Charles Martel, the day will come again
I'll see you lead the cavalry to charge!
Charles Martel, in the battle of Ambleve
You dyed Malmedy blood-red!
Tours recall the glory of your hosts
Thy fame is sung on harps with golden strings!
The crescent moon you drove back to the sea
Once and for all...
Homus Paganus
The cock crew in the morning,
I arose and went to the fields
Holding but a handful of seeds;
First I did sow then I did plough-
I prayed for rain to come down:
I prayed to Thor to burden the clouds
I looked up with hopes of a sky
Heavy, impregnated by a storm,
That would bring to life once more
My last handful of seeds;
I dreamt of the barely rich on the fields,
Would that I had a scythe
To reap all day long and then some more,
So as I could keep my storehouse filled
And put bread and ale upon my table...
Pray the Gods hear me,
Pray the wind bears my plea afar-
To the fields on high
Where immortals turn the soil
And blessings ripen like fruit
On the trees that guards vigilant
The fragrant orchards of Freyja...
(Intro) The Pipes Are Calling
Wolfsong In Moonlight (Fenris Unbound)
Child of atrocity - Progeny of Hel
Son of maiden fell;
Bound in dwarven chain
Helpless roar in rage!
Time for stars to fall
Ragnark's inaugural call!
Odin holds the prophecy scroll.
Release the beast!
Fimbul winter comes
Fires dying fast!
Wolf-song rides the gale
Frost whips with hail.
Release the beast!
Gluten maws in bloody feast
Horned Trolls And Mystical Folk
Horned trolls and mystical folk
Within the deep woods of twilight
Ethereal misty fingers entwine
Crooked boughs and mossy roots
Smell of the rain soaked ground.
Yet hark! What be this sound
Coming from afar?
Haunting tunes, the fairy song
They join in rings to dance
Plucking fiddles hewn of oak
Dwell in a citadel of fog
Horned trolls and mystical folk!
These horned trolls and mystical folk!
They dwell in the brooks
The dwell on the trees!
They live under rock,
They live by the sea!
Astride frogs and dragon flies
The travel far and wide
Mortal dreamers they invite
To their realm of ever light!
Perchance in thy strangest dremas
You glimpse fairies soynd asleep.
There by the creek.
Yet deeper still
They join in rings to dance
Plucking fiddles hewn of oak
Dwell in a citadel of fog
Horned trolls and mystical folk!
These horned trolls and mystical folk!
They dwell in the brooks
The dwell on the trees!
They live under rock,
They live by the sea!
Rhyming With Thunder
Great God of the storm, Ruler of the skies above,
Mighty ever-warrior Thor
Thy name we call
Descend to Midgard
Great God of the gloom,
We summon you!
Rhyming with thunder, chanter the holy Galder!
Modi, Thruder, Magni - Thor!
Master of the tempest, lord of wintry call,
Modi, Thruder, Magni - He is Thor, one and all!
Swing thy holy hammer
Warriors revel in the sight
With swords upraised
To hail the pouring rain
I greet thee chariot rider,
Frost giants bane!
Never fall, always uphold this battle hymn of old!
Mortal kinsmen die,
As crops wither and subside
Wealth is passing by.
Yet eternal remains a glorious deed's name!
A legacy of honor, legend for tomorrow!
For what glory warriors await
Once their heyday goes under
Save a skald's praise, rhyming with thunder?
Swing thy holy hammer
Warriors revel in the sight
With swords upraised
To hail the pouring rain
I greet thee chariot rider,
Frost giants bane!
Never fall, always uphold this battle hymn of old!
Rhyming with thunder, chanter the holy Galder!
Modi, Thruder, Magni - Thor!
Master of the tempest, lord of wintry call,
Modi, Thruder, Magni - He is Thor, one and all!
Eldritch Sorcery And Faery Runes
Spirit of the ash tree
Dweller in the oak, Thy realm I wish to traverse;
I whisper the ancient verse
Whisper the ancient verse
Passage safe to earn.
Gods of the earth,
You who made sylvan breath
Hear now my spells
Hear now my spells
As I flirt nightshade
In pagan forests primeval
Where dusk enthroned is king!
Once upon a day
On the wings of fairytale, Shamanic paths I take
Where in adoration
Wolves to the moon bay;
To the moon bay
Another figure I bcome
Inside the sylvan canvass
Hidden, away far from your world
I have ridden!
Spireless lands await me
In a world of elder magecraft
Elven runes engraved
Upon hyperborean skies
Like stars arrayed.
The man in black
There he awaits;
And there's no coming back!
Forest calling to mine ear
Distand echoes of the Dryad.
Enthralled I stand by this woodland melody.
Upon the altar of yew
Before Fangorn's palace
The Elven heart is beating;
Rhythm of my breathing
My hands lie bleeding
Dagger bitten grimly
An offering of life
To ethereal folk I sing.
An eerie moon beckons me
Gnarled boughs whistle
Attuned to a magic wind,
Call of elder arts I hearken!
Rings of stones, Idols of crows
Whilst primordial wonders stir the air
Trees lively welcome me
In this mystical realm
Of eldritch sorcery and Faery runes.
Faery runes...
In Odin's Court
"And Io, do I see my father
And Io, do I see my mother
And my sisters and my brothers
And the line of my people,
Back to the beginning...
And Io, they do call me,
In the halls of Valhalla
Where the brave may live forever!"
From death's embrace I awaken
Clutching the sword my life had taken;
Roofs thatched with gold
Songs of warriors old
In Odin's court
My eyes behold splendor untold!
What be this place?
What maiden brought my sould herein?
These are the halls
Of glorious Valhalla!
Step forth ye hammerheart,
Blessed champion of the Gods!
Heimdall will guard it
Vidar will welcome
In Odin's court our Einherjer brethren!
Come o beloved of the Raven,
Feast on flesh and mead;
Forever and all time
'Till Ragnarok arrives!
These are the halls
Of mighty Valhalla!
Heimdall will guard it
Vidar will welcome
In Odin's court
In Odin's court
I return to the ancient tree;
What was, shall forever be
Every nche resounds eternally
Warlike triumphant song
There in Odin's court!
Storm Ravens Come
Hammers of thunder temper a storm
Wailing the wonds descend from the North
Dragons awaken in their sanctums of frost
Three hundred berserkers strong
Sail a' Viking ere the break of dawn!
Plunder in the East
Raze village - burn monasteries
Wicked thralls of this pale Christ
"In our heart we know no fear
In our eyes swells no tear.
Should death we meet today
Let it be so...
Crowned in glory we shall fall!"
Storm Ravens sweep me away
Howl blood to the wintry sway
In Valhalla for me Odin shall await!
Call beyond the nigthly sky
The brave who lost their lives
Howl blood to the wintry sway
In Valhalla for me Odin shall await!
Feel the rage of the Aesir and die!
Storm Ravens come
With swords blessed by the Gods
Raging and furious
In battle they stand victorious
Twin ravens soaring high
Feel the rage of Aesir and die!
Storm Ravens come
Gaelic Valor
When the Moon still was young and the mountains were tall
In the realm of the Tuatha De Danann,
My delight was the sound of the hammer and forge
Shaping bronze into weapons of war.
When the Heroes of Dawn put the ginats to the sword
Strong was Cuchulain and shining was Lugh
They would sing to the wind with a falcon at their fist
Hymns of Gaelic valor.
I remember the day when their ships filled the sea
And the emblems of Rome hid the sky,
When the ninth legion marched to subdue the Red Queen
And the sons of the Goddes Danann.
The the Heroes of Dawn put the Romans to the sword
Strong like Cuchulain and shining like Lugh
They would fight skyclad, and to please the Morrigan
Die for Gaelic valor.
Now the Moon's in eclipse and the skies breed a storm
O'er the realm of the Tuatha de Danann
My lament shall be heard for the fires ashen cold
And the anvils resounding no more.
Now the Heroes of Dawn sleep in mounds underground
Cuchulain forgotten - forgotten is Lugh,
Who shall sing to the wind, shed his tears to fill the sea
For the lost Gaelic valor?I've been losing - All my life
Been misused - Endless trife
Raging fury - Lonely soul
Foreboding warning - Never whole
I'm cursed and I'm damned forever
Destined to walk this land
I'm cursed and I'm damned forever
Battle is my only friend
Blood stained morning - Darkened skies
Still that longing - No more lies
Raging fury - Lonely soul
Foreboding warning - Never whole
I'm cursed and I'm damned forever
Destined to walk this land
I'm cursed and I'm damned forever
Battle is my only friend
Neither wolf nor man
Summer Solstice
At the summer solstice you and I will gather round the strong
We'll drink a toast from the cup of blood and realize the truth
Come on now let's see what we can find beyond the stars
Release your soul and tear apart the chains of you heavy load
Fire -Magick
We will find our peace of mind
Fire - Magick
We'll leave this tired world behind
At the summer solstice we will make a bond so strong and true
Hates bodies swirling 'round the golden ripened corn
Come on now let the sacrifice but for all who know
That the Sun and Moon still rule our lives today and evermore
Fire -Magick
We will find our peace of mind
Fire - Magick
We'll leave this tired world behind

Keepers of a secret shadow things are near
They only offer you and me eternal life
Look within my friend 'cause it's time to decide

Legion
A mighty blast of fire burned across the sky
It is no unknown power causing this tonight
They didn't know I had it in me but I have returned
Transformed, no longer human, watch the heavens burn
You'll pay
They hear the hooves thundering, raising up a storm
He comes with vengeance seething, breaking up the calm
Been called a traitor and a fool so many times
From now on all apposing men will fear the sign
Twisting, turning, riding across the plain
Creating a river of blood, bringer of pain
The god of war, destroyer of all in his reign
Legion's the name called by the toll of bell
Been called a traitor and a fool so many times
From now on all apposing men will fear the sign
Twisting, turning, riding across the plain
Creating a river of blood, bringer of pain
The god of war, destroyer of all in his reign
Legion's the name called by the toll of bell
Never Learned
I have been told
Why I can't grow old

To stay away
When the water churns
Alright

Cause I never learned

Black Hound Of Vengeance
Got firm belief in what's to come
Your treacherous ways leave me cold and numb
No magic circle will save you now
Your scent's been picked up by my wish to strike
You try to hide behind a veil of smoke
To summon petty demons, will not work
Cause my familiar has searched you out
To make you pay for all the pain I took

Coat Of Arms
A glade became the setting
Must have been about noon
Grass so green and tender
Ripped apart by steel clad boots
Mid-day's sun reflected
In weapons sharp as steel
Grim determination
One shall die and one shall live
And the dawn became the winner
Sun and moon will rise again
Coat of arms shine and shimmer
A king has been crowned
Now the wounds are open
Blood engulfing all
Ready for the gauntlet
One will stand and one will fall
And the dawn became the winner
Sun and moon will rise again
Coat of arms shine and shimmer
A king has been crowned
And the dawn became the winner
Sun and moon will rise again
Coat of arms shine and shimmer
A king has been crowned
Alright
Generator
Like a lead-heavy generator
Just pushing everything aside
I took my pill and now I feel alright
Like a wheel dead-set on moving
Perpetual bliss in sight
I took my fill and now I feel alright
Oh yeah, I feel alright
Believe me I feel just fine
Oh yeah, I feel alright
Got no restraining shackles
Just a highway stretching far and wide
The sun shines down and feeds me with what I need
There ain't nobody waiting
I'm free to do whatever I please
I've flipped the coin and now I will be seen
Yeah, I will be seen
I'm coming out, I'm coming clean
Oh yeah I will be seen
I will be mean
Emerald, emerald eyes rising from the tomb
No, no quarter in sight, generator of light
Emerald, emerald eyes rising from the tomb
No, no quarter in sight, now you meet your doom
Emerald, emerald eyes prepare for your undoing
No, no quarter in sight, generator of light
Oh come on
Yeah
Wheel Of Time
Wheel of time rotating ever onward
Nothing new and nothing has been learned
The same mistakes still repeated every time
A pleasant ignorance rules the crooked line
Stand back and face your terrible fate
Your soul has been circumscribed
And your body will just wither away
Time to wake from your non-creative slumber
Seasons change but still you stay the same
A crushing blow's going to force your decision
You realize that there is no prize for you
Stand back and face your terrible fate
Your soul has been circumscribed
And your body will wither away
Roll on, wheel of time
Roll on, just crush and grind
Roll on, wheel of time
Roll on, wheel of time!
Yeah
Roll on, wheel of time
Roll on, just crush and grind
Roll on, wheel of time
Roll on, wheel of time!

Sacrifice
The only way to be sure
To rid the land
Of the plague that's been haunting us all
Restoring our faith
In the axe and the sword
Slaves for so long
Our minds filled up with their lies
Now the Christian cross
Forever erased from our eyes
Rejoice all free men
Betrayer, run if you can
Rejoice all free men
Betrayer, run if you can
Run if you can
Run if you can
Run if you can
RUN IF YOU CAN
Black Hole
All that I want, give me just what I need
What I've been told ain't exactly what I've seen
I'll just lay low here for the time being
Even though I risk falling in that Black Hole
Now that I have seen all that there is in this land
I've proven my worth to my fellow man
I'll just take a backseat to what's going on
Even though I risk falling in that Black Hole
Selling my soul
No remainder for the fools
Losing all control
All that is, is the wind of my soul
In that Black Hole
Black Hole

Now that I have seen all that there is in this land
I've proven my worth to my fellow man

Losing all control
All that is, the wind of my soul, yeah

Mountain Of Power
Sure enough can't figure out
Why all that's good is sin
Why people choose to grovel at
The feet of some dreamed up king
Too scared to fight their own way
So easy to be sheep
Alive but dead inside
Holier than thou
Condemning all around them
They're the chosen ones
Now hypocrisy's king
Defiling everything
And at judgement's hour crumble, yeah
Crumble you mountain of power
Still signs of hope are many
Reason covers ground
Two thousand years of twisted lies
Soon just a burial mound
Too scared to fight their own way
So easy to be sheep
Alive but dead inside
Holier than thou
Condemning all around them
They're the chosen ones
Now hypocrisy's king
Defiling everything
And at judgement's hour crumble, yeah
Crumble you mountain of power
Now hypocrisy's king
Defiling everything
And at judgement's hour crumble, yeah
You mountain of power

Crowned usurper wasting time and our wealth - you must go

Your blood is feeble a failing line of heirs - down you go
And we'll see him falling now

Wield the sword
Hanged, by free will doomed
Trusting just in strength
Hanged, rewarded soon
Growing tall again
Wield the sword

On Hooves Of Gold
They are masters of defiance - masters of the wind
Let us fly together - let the change begin
Mountains lie below us - the stars are getting near
All doubt has left my being - strength replacing fear
And they said it's too late - but the bastards will pay
As we ride the wind and fly
On hooves of gold we ride
Consuming without feeling - a hollow life of shame
The elders, well of knowledge - discarded, thrown away
New gods taking over - thievery and false pride
Burn the gifts of nature, laugh at the giver of life
With greed raping the land
They don't even know what they demand, no
And they say it's too late - but the bastards will pay
As we ride the wind and fly
On hooves of gold we ride
Ride the wind - change begin
And they say it's too late
But the bastards will pay
As we ride the wind and fly
On hooves of gold we ride
Steel Versus Steel
"I was a thousand times more evil than thou"
Drifting away into dreams of despair
Visions of doom and of dead eyes that stare
Will the end be what you thought - will you escape?
Across the plains you rode as you fled
The lord of chaos put a price on your head
And the black blade at your side won't let you rest
To slay became a trade
Your soul will have to pay
The final fate a clash between the blades
And in the end it's steel versus steel
The final lock and the final key
It's the steel versus steel
A thousand souls won't tame the need
Steel versus steel
The final lock and the final key
Steel versus steel
Skin as white as the full moon at night
Eyes that burn like a red fire light
But the body's still as weak as a newborn child
Tried to rule with mercy inside
Ignore tradition and the dragons will rise
The dreaming city falls - lost in time
To slay became a trade
Your soul will have to pay
The final fate a clash between the blades
'Cause in the end it's steel versus steel
The final lock and the final key
It's the steel versus steel
A thousand souls won't tame the need
Steel versus steel
The final lock and the final key
Steel versus steel
A thousand souls won't tame the need
To slay became a trade
You will travel on the seas of fate
The seas of fate - between the blades
The price to pay - the end of time
The final fate a clash between the blades
And in the end it's steel versus steel
The final lock and the final key
Steel versus steel
A thousand souls won't tame the need
Steel versus steel
The final lock and the final key
Steel versus steel
A thousand souls won't tame the need
It's the steel versus steel
The final lock and the final key - the steel
Fight
They forged an alliance - and legions attend
They steal and conspire - all means to an end
Soon they must fall - we'll rise from our crawl
And summon the strength from within
'Cause we will fight for the right to defend
Fight for the right till the end
Conquer and divide
Fight for the right to survive
Through ages of darkness, slavery and pain
The lie they call "progress" - an expanding domain
Soon they must fall - we'll rise from our crawl
And summon the strength from within
And we will fight for the right to defend
Fight for the right 'til the end
Conquer and divide
Fight for the right to survive
Fight with the power of rage
Fight to the end of our age
With fury burning inside
Fight for the right to survive
For too long did we relent
While they stole at our expense
Now the tide has turned
They must fall
and we will rise standing tall
Fight with the power of rage
Fight to the end of our age
With fury burning inside
Fight for the right to survive
Fight for the right to defend
Fight for the right 'til the end
Conquer and divide
Fight for the right to survive
Triumph And Power
Room to breathe
Fill my need
Give me space
Plant the seed
Born alone
Slowly grown
There's a strength
In my breed
Now my goal
Has been shown
As I march
'Til dawn
For the triumph and the power
Spoils of war
For the hunger and desire
A blood red throne
I ascend to the sky
By the dawn's early light
Fight for glory until death
Hail victory
Will of iron
Quiet soul
Empty words
Empty roles
Break their walls
Break their rules
Fiercely defiant
Damn the fools
Now my goal
Has been shown
As I march
'Til dawn
For the triumph and the power
Spoils of war
For the hunger and desire
A blood red throne
I ascend to the sky
By the dawn's early light
Fight for glory until death
Hail victory
At last there's a reason to believe
To rise from the depths of misery
My heart clad in iron
My soul clad in steel
The triumph and power achieved
As I march
'Til dawn
For the triumph and the power
Spoils of war
For the hunger and desire
A blood red throne
I ascend to the sky
By the dawn's early light
Fight for glory until death
Hail victory
For the triumph and the power
Spoils of war
For the hunger and desire
A blood red throne
I ascend to the sky
By the dawn's early light
Fight for glory until death
Hail victory
Dominator
He made a promise many years ago to break and scorch the land
He had a need for destruction and to bend us to the ground
He swore an oath: To bring us fear and pain
To never bend or rest until it's done - before he had become
The dominator - freedom hater - he will break us, crush our dreams
Amputator - lacerator - spreading madness, mindless hate - dominate
Bringing everlasting pain
So many tragedies and years ago for you to understand
The devastation that he brought will leave a mark until the end
He swore an oath - to bring us fear and pain
To never bend or rest until it's done - before he had become
The dominator - freedom hater - he will break us, crush our dreams
Amputator - lacerator - spreading madness, mindless hate - dominate
He walks alone
He'll put out our fire with scorn
He'll never rest - just enslave us
Destroyer of beasts and of man
Enforcer of madness and pain
He's sworn to break us - the dominator
Born of hate - Crush and break - Annihilate - Dominate
I swore an oath - I will reverse his plan
I will restore - bringing power to the land, but the price is that I am
The dominator - freedom hater - I will bleed you, crush your dreams
Amputator - lacerator - spreading madness, mindless hate - breathing pain
Born of hate - Crush and break - Annihilate – Dominate

Holmgång
You're awaiting your turn, jealousy burns - you know you had your chance
Wanting to lead, filling your greed - envy drives your plans
Stole what I made, all that I saved - never letting up
But in the end there can be only one - and justice will be done
Take your light
Got nowhere to run
Bring the fight
You know the time is now
Steal your life
Got nowhere to run
Take your light
Sun in the back when I attack - there is no return
Beckoning time, I know what is mine - only you will burn
In the light of the day you'll finally pay - this is what you learn
In the end there can be only one - and justice will be done
Take your light
Got nowhere to run
Bring the fight
Justice will be done
Steal your life
Got nowhere to run
Take your light
There can be only one
Take your light
Got nowhere to run
Bring the fight
You know the time is now
Steal your life
Got nowhere to run
Take your light
The Naked And The Dead
In a flash he turned to stone
Hesitated, lost control
Just a man a dying warrior
Battleground drenched in blood
Bodies flayed down in the mud
Mercy never came on this day
For the naked and the dead
There's no glory or reward to be had
If the spirit travels on it's by will power alone
'Cause the body's just a cell of flesh and blood
While the blood seeps to the ground
There are times you realise
How the pain can change your life
Bragging fools will surely pay the price
No set of rules will end the strife
You have to twist and bend in life
The mind is what defines a warrior
For the naked and the dead
There's no glory or reward to be had
If the spirit travels on it's by will power alone
'Cause the body's just a cell of flesh and blood
For the naked and the dead
There's no glory or reward to be had
And if the spirit travels on it's by will power alone
'Cause the body's just a cell of flesh and blood
While the blood seeps to the ground
Only the chosen one will rise

The Hammer Will Bite
The giant arrived, scheming to end Asa rule
Mean as a whip, hard as a rock but a fool
The battle will start at the first light of tomorrow
Jorunheim knew what the thunder would bring
The hammer will bite - no other choice than surrender
Bow to the might - a fiery death from above
The hammer will bite - shattering stone and offenders
Run for your lives - thunder and doom crack the sky
The hammer will bite - you will die
Colossal in size, they built him with magic and clay
Heart from a horse, a fatal mistake for this day
Protector of Asgard never lacked courage
The towering help to the giants will fail
The hammer will bite - no other choice than surrender
Bow to the might - a fiery death from above
The hammer will bite - shattering stone and offenders
Run for your lives - thunder and doom crack the sky
The hammer will bite - you will die
By morning light - the giants die
My death is guaranteed - unless I make him bleed
I can't face him on my own - it's sorcery I need
My help is gone - I'm on my own
My stone is thrown - all is lost
The hammer will bite - no other choice than surrender
Bow to the might - a fiery death from above
The hammer will bite - shattering stone and offenders
Run for your lives - thunder and doom crack the sky
The hammer will bite - you will die
By morning light - the giants die
Like The Oar Strikes The Water
Defile your life with religion
And sell your soul
You put all trust in your holy man
You may deny it's illusion
Just worthless rules
You turn away when you thin you can
Corrupting life with suppression
The safest way
You wash your hands in your piety
The winds have turned in your favour
Your time is here
A congregation on a massive scale
But when the night finally falls
And when the truth finally dawns
Just like the oar strikes the water
But when the night finally falls
Yeah when the truth finally dawns
Just like the oar strikes the water
Fear Is The Key
Hear crushing thunder
Electrifying storm
Winter is calling
Time to hold one's own
Fear is the weapon
To break the cage of man
Control lies inside me
The terror reveals the plan
Unbeliever, unbeliever
The mind will tell me how
Fear is the key
Last of the shadows
Screaming out my name
Strong determination
A guide through searing flame
Blind Beliver
Choose the easy way
Pray for absolution
You know you've gone astray
When blackest depths will face me
Ask no one's help, to break my fall
Born, dead and free forever
I know that fear is the key
Iron Will
Failure - reaching out to greet me
But I will never fall
Aversion - has filled my inner being
But I will never crawl
Obsession - I never fell the pain
Redemption - I will rise again
Again and again
Iron will
I'll never give in or surrender
Iron will
Remind me to always remember
Hatred - it used to feel so easy
Turn away when they call
Craving - driven by the strong need
Alone against them all
Aggression - fuelled by burning hate
Vengeance - I will rise again
Again and again
Iron will
I'll never give in or surrender
Iron will
Remind me to always remember

Silver Into Steel
Time is at hand
Gathering hunger in the night
To feast and to burn
better look for the right of his hands
Summon a feeling of might
Caressed by the dark
The glow of the moon in the eye
Kissing the sweet taste in the air
Embraced by the stars
A home has been found in the end
Time is at hand
Of triumph and sense
A revenge for the times of despair
Silver into Steel
The Shadow Knows
The laugh will be the warning
He will break your mental wall
Pulverize resistance
Then sacrifice you all

To never be a slave
To stand among the fallen
And fight beyond the grave

Stare into the hearts of men
All Misery Treachery

Will shiver at his gaze
The weed of crime may blossom
But will perish in his flame

Beyond Good And Evil
You smile and claim purity of soul
I feel the need to rise above it all
A burning urge will guide me away
Your black and white will lose to the grey
As i walk - beyond good and evil
Your rules betray your need to make a stand
You fight the herd, still need security
There is no true or false in the world
You might be right but I'm not wrong
As i walk - beyond good and evil
beyond good and evil
good and evil
good and evil
beyond good and evil
I Am The North
Joined by the cry of ravens
A chase in the winter cold
First born son of storms
hated and scorned
Free from the cage of morals
Shadow of the ruling kind
The echoes of the savage call
Roll across the land
Truth and lie will join and die
Grey ruler show us how to fight
The Wolf will rise
The end of lies
Corruption dies
Free forever
Burn with the lord of sorrow
Claimed by the shit of nails
Life and death - final breath
Born into the grave
Storm of an ancient fury
Power beyond compare
Serpent's flood - brother's blood
End of times is here
Truth and lie will join and die
Grey ruler show us how to fight
I, The Jury
Damnation - their lies used to lead me away
Feeding my desperate heart - with merciless flames
I soon realized there's nothing to gain
And all the dreams that I had had got lost in my pain
I want to learn - I want to see
I'm gonna learn - gonna see - and I'm gonna turn
Because I'm the Law
Wisdom has sprung - and taken my heart
Nothing will stand in my way - I'll tear them apart
Revelation - no one can lead me astra
Follow my own burning path - away from all slaves
I want to learn - I want to see
I'm gonna learn - gonna see - and I'm gonna turn
Because I'm the Law
Riding the teeth of the wind - all barriers part
I want to learn - I want to see
I'm gonna learn - gonna see - and I'm gonna turn
Because I'm the Law
Hammer Of The North
Black fire
burns in the twilight
The forest glows
Free heart
passion and defiance
pine and hooded crow
Spring eve
glory of the raven
melt the last of the snow
Gold sparks - set the night afire
It's my joy
Hammer of the North
It's late - silver stars shining - a toast to future goals
Black sky - everlasting beauty - brothers by my side
We smile - nature's celebration - we're fierce yet calm
Gold sparks - set the night afire
It's my joy
We'll learn every secret, we'll trample the cross
We'll curse at the giants, we'll laugh as we toss
Hammer of the North
We believe it's our legacy
Masters of our fate - their logic won't dictate
Their gods will fail - then we rise
Hammer of the North
Black Sails
Whipping in the wind
Rule with fear and dreams that tear the light
Sleepless empty nights
A shiver of desperation
Black sails rippling in the wind
Will the dream provide liberation?
Or pain in the end
Haunting dreams of red
Bringing doom - Bringing death
Black sails charge ahead
Rule with dread
Simple life seems hard
Looming shadows
They stalk
A shiver of desperation
Black sails rippling in the wind
Will the dream provide liberation?
Or pain in the end
Haunting dreams of red
Bringing doom - Bringing death
Black sails charge ahead
Rule with dread
The sea turns red
Bringing doom - Bringing death
Black sails charge ahead
Rule with dread
Mountains Be My Throne
I'm coming don to the meeting
There's trouble all around
A final push for the silence
The symbol has been shown
Now if I can't wield the power
I'll find another way
Without your guide, will you make it?
Just sheep that go astray
Rising
Watch me climbing
Far away - where nothing binds me
I'm done with all your fighting
Make it known - let mountains be my throne
Rising
Watch me climbing
Far away - where nothing binds me
I'm done with all your fighting
Make it known - let mountains be my throne
Rising
Watch me climbing
Soaring high, the sun won't bind me
I'm done with all your fighting
Make it known - let mountains be my throne
Northern Star
Living in denial and never seeing straight or clear
Deep down in your senses you feel that fear
Fear of true alliance, nothing worth the fight
No use standing up when wrong rule what's right
When they bring you despair
Don't resort to prayer
Time for fast decisions
Now it's live or die
Strength is summoned from within
Northern star
Banish the false religions
Learn to stand alone
Nothing up above and no one below
Fear of new beginnings
Like a demon in your soul
You must turn your ear to the beckoning call
When they bring you despair
Don't resort to prayer
Time for fast decisions
Now it's live or die
Weakness spreading like a plague
Will you make the change or stay the same and fail
Strength is summoned from within
Northern star
The Lord Of Lies
The lord of lies
He'll steal your life away
And grasp the victor's prize - He's born of fire
He'll claim your soul as pray
The trickster of all time
The lord of lies
Take a deep breath
Watch the forest pull him in
Preparations - Soon the trials will begin
A sacrifice - to make it work he must endure the pain
A conjuring - free the magic, fan the flames again
The lord of lies
He'll steal your life away
And grasp the victor's prize
He's born of fire
He'll claim your soul as pray
The trickster of all time
The lord of lies
Son of giants
Lust and hate is his disguise
Purifier - Naked he'll escape the fires
A sacrifice - to make it work he must endure the pain
A conjuring - free the magic, fan the flames again
The lord of lies
He'll steal your life away
And grasp the victor's prize - He's born of fire
He'll claim your soul as pray
The trickster of all time
The lord of lies
At Midnight They'll Get Wise
The barren land lies empty, no enemies in sight
Though no one ever told them, at midnight they'll get wise
As shadow falls upon them,
no one even dares to speak your name
They'll be given the lesson of their lives
Blood and death will follow
As they get wise
To the lies they believed to be real
And they will pay the price by facing the truth and its deal
When they die
At midnight they'll get wise
A shape of hidden power, a presence of true might
Trust in feral knowledge, their fires will die out
Servants to a coward, no one even dares to stand alone
Eyes roll back in terror - the panic starts to rise
Blood and death will follow
As they get wise
To the lies they believed to be real
And they will pay the price by facing the truth and its deal
When they die
At midnight they'll get wise
Watch the hunt-god rise
Bond Of Blood
A never ending tale
You lose but never fail
You're going to be the last to learn
To see what's right and wrong
You waited much too long
The truth is somewhere in between
but you've never seen
Now as I burn in fire
You will recall - you will remember my name
Smouldering sea, smoke rises
You'll see the truth
you will be taught by the flames
Bond of blood
Suppose you change your ways
A simple choice to make
You'll be rewarded by yourself
Possessing all that skill
To use at your own will
You better find another way
Or you'll go astray
Now as I burn in fire
You will recall - you will remember my name
Smouldering sea, smoke rises
You'll see the truth
you will be taught by the flames
Bond of blood
Savage Tales
See the savage son arrive
striking terror on all sides
He's been waiting all this time
for his reign to come alive
Bite
he will do or die
Fight to hold on, aim for the throne
Bite
he will burn their pride
Rise northern child you've grown
See the iron sky descend
on a world that just pretends
It's a lonely path to walk
but an honor to defend
Those who walk against the wind
will always walk alone
Ravens Guide Our Way
We ride endless blackened waves
To  the land of our kin
Snow lords, kings of northern seas

Born For Battle (Black Dog Of Brocéliande)
You were just a child when the flame began to burn
You could not run you could not hide
No one told you there was so much more to learn
Just would not stop before you tried
You hear the calling
Inside you knew
Born for battle
I heard the calling
Hated and scorned
My sword was the warning
I'll defend when you call for
The king has justified the cruelty and pain
A crown and glory
To revel in
Short in stature but a savior to the land
Just let them burn and let me win
I heard the calling
Inside I knew
Born for battle
I heard the calling
Hated and scorned
My sword was the warning
I'll defend to the end
I'm the underdog
Never bark before I bite
Peace a word I never learned
In war my victories mean strife and loss of lives
Never cared if I'd return
Born for battle
My need was created at birth
For glory and blood I was born – burn
Never cared if I'd return
Born for battle
I heard the calling
I'll defend when you call for battle
My sword was the warning
I was born for battle
Master Of The Land
Light, the search goes on inside
Deep within my mind
A key that seems to hide
Torn, chained and bound with scorn
Let me be reborn
Into glory ride
Make me master of the land
Master of the land
Master of the land
Answer the call into the fire burn
Free, longing to reveal
A dream so long concealed
Destiny achieved
Burn, wisdom will be mine
Secrets I will learn
Into glory ride
Make me master of the land
Master of the land
Master of the land
Answer the call into the fire
Make me master of the land
Master of the land
Master of the land
Answer the call 
Make me master of the land
Master of the land
Master of the land
Answer the call into the fire burn
Last One To Fall
Facing the enemy fear and insanity
Fight with your back to the wall
Horses are falling no quarter is given
Ravens will feast on them all
Gather your strength and ride through the storm
No one will catch you alive
It weather of blades and as twilight sets in
This is the final goodbye
Marching on -
You'll be the last one to fall
Marching on -
You'll be the last one to fall
Bereft of all dignity, pain and depravity
No one will live through this day
The sound of the suffering left as an offering
Souls sent to Valhalla's gates
You stand in the rain as you fought through it all
Tomorrow will never appear
Embracing your fate as the dusk closes in
Blood is the prize of the brave
Marching on -
You'll be the last one to fall
Marching on -
You'll be the last one to fall
Bereft of all dignity
Blood is the prize of the brave
No one will live through this day
Souls sent to Valhalla's gates
Ride through the storm
Song of the sword
You'll be marching on
You'll be the last one to fall
Marching on -
You'll be the last one to fall
Frost And Fire
Burning hair
Bringer of despair
Mother of the one who takes the moon
Fierce and tall she will devour all
And her spawn will break the seal of runes
Winds that rage across the fields and lakes
She will ride out from the frozen realm
Screaming through the sky
Wreathed in fury
With frost and fire tame the land
She'll rule, take charge and command
Shadow steed will bring her fatal deeds
And a power never seen before
Serpent reins on a wolf from Hel
She descended on the funeral shore
The gathering didn't have her strength
And she proved that she could best them all
Daughter of the ironwood has come
With frost and fire tame the land
She'll rule, take charge and command
As the ring horn sails
She has won
And her sons will rise
Frost and fire tame the land
She'll rule, take charge and command
With frost and fire tame the land
She'll rule, take charge and command

Every Day There's A Battle To Fight
All the walls around you
No one really knows how they were made
Who chose that way?
Conformity or safety
Questioning your sanity is brave
You're not a slave, no
Too many hearts grow stale and cold
Too many die inside and fold
Everyday there's a battle to fight
Never let yourself surrender to the pain
You've got to get up
Be strong and fight them all 
Never let the fear stand in your way
Find the key inside you
Shining through the madness and the hate
It's not too late
A path is always open
Reborn into the thunder and the rain
Free from all shame, yeah
The smallest creatures have it right
The truth is grey not black and white
Everyday there's a battle to fight
Never let yourself surrender to the pain
You've got to get up
Be strong and fight them all 
Never let the fear stand in your way
Stand in your way
In For The Kill
Born again as dusk approaches
I've been living far too long as a slave
To the laws of your world
Sound the howl of total freedom
Make the sky and earth my kingdom
There's a gleam and a flash in my eyes
By tomorrow all the sorrow will be gone
I am in for the kill
One with the moon and the wind
In for the kill
One with the moon and the wind
Now their walls give no protection
The grip of fear means no detection
Of the force set upon men and gods
No belief and no religion
Will protect your life from leaving
As the fear reaches out to your soul
It's a grasp that will never let its hold
I am in for the kill
One with the moon and the wind
In for the kill
One with the moon and the wind
You will die
Starlight Slaughter
Go on tell me 'bout the reason always turning wrong from right just try, explain your sad existence, why you seem to fear the night
Your answer will show - that dead is your king
I look in your eyes - confusion within
You lose all your pride, and scream as i bite
In a starlight slaughter - vengeance will be mine
Starlight slaughter - rise of wolf kind
Too late, I asked you and i listened and groveling won't save you now
Your tales betray your lack of freedom, struggling to face the light
My Hymn to the moon piercing your mind
Your science will fail
Your eyes turn blind
When red turns to black and the silver moon is full
They will drown in lakes of blood, and regret what they tried to pull
Starlight slaughter - vengeance will be mine
Starlight slaughter - rise of wolf kind
Sword Of The Ocean
The first was the last one
The last one to fall
He sounded the warning
And put out the call
Remorseless invaders or traders with gold?
Stand or run
Will flesh pay for metal or riches be shared - stand or run
We bring the fire and the flame
Agony and pain
Sword of the ocean carve me your name
The men on the shoreline
Guardians of old
They prayed for a warning
They ran from the wall
Remorseless invaders or traders with gold?
Stand or run
Will flesh pay for metal or riches be shared - stand or run
We bring the fire and the flame
Agony and pain
Sword of the ocean carve me your name
Valhalla Rising
Feel – take my hand
See – wasted lands
‘Cause I lost my fire, and it’s tearing up my soul
Got to fight if I want it
So tired of liars, they’re filling me with shame
Got to fight and get stronger
But the road is long and treachery awaits
To find what’s wrong I have to reach and reveal to see
Valhalla rising – I’m taking flight
Let Valkyries guide me to my destiny
Valhalla rising – I burn tonight
Let ravens fly and give my soul release
The fire is the seed
Take my hand!
No more wasted lands...
I restored my fire now it’s filling up my soul
Even though I was broken
And I fought the liars – the worst of all was me
All the false words I’d spoken
As I travelled on I realised my fate
It made me strong and now I finally see what's been revealed
Valhalla rising – I’m taking flight
Let Valkyries guide me to my destiny
Valhalla rising – I burn tonight
Let ravens fly and give my soul release
The fire was the seed
Take my hand!
No more wasted lands...
And now I finally see what's been revealed
Valhalla rising – I’m taking flight
Let Valkyries guide me to my destiny
Valhalla rising – I burn tonight
Let ravens fly and give my soul release
The fire was the seed
Take my hand!
Storm King
Time to reap all the violence they have sewn
Kept you down with their torture
Crushed your bones
From slavery your rebellion screams of fire
Too late 'cause you'll never be their pawn
You've grown too strong
You're the Storm King
Ride the lightning
Rule the thunder shake the ground
Two thousand years spent imprisoned
You were chained
Born a stallion but broken down - hurt and malmed
A fury and rage ignited in the tears
they'll pay and you'll never be their pawn
You've grown too strong
You're the Storm King
Ride the lightning
Rule the thunder, shake the ground
Silver Moon
Unleashed by my hate -
Flesh torn away from the bone
A fire that burns - a fever that never subsides
Surrender to fate - free from the shackles that bind
By the silvery sheen -
The moon will decide who will die
I've found the strength to live alone
I've left my kin I've left my home
By silver light I'll carve my own
To last and live my power's grown
Embers - burning runes
Sever the ties - destiny calls
Black sky - silver moon
I'm gonna rise - you're gonna fall
Summoning fire - men of the cross stand aside
A heathen belief - northern revenge is at hand
No masters or kings -
The cry for my freedom resounds
The passion is free -
The blood-covered snow is the sign
Embers - burning runes
Sever the ties - destiny calls
Black sky - silver moon
I'm gonna rise - you're gonna fall
The Hunt
He's alive -- the stories were right
And now there's a lesson to learn
Took his land and curse him as damned
But now he will make them all burn
Tonight the grey one's arrived
To reveal all the lies, the shadow's arrived
And he won't shed a tear for our emptiness and fear
Blood will spill
I follow the hunt
Chase and kill
Follow the hunt
Running free, the beast inside of me
Will join in his howl to the moon
Every sense come alive
And the passion ignites
'cause his beckoning call brings us doom
Tonight the grey one's arrived
To reveal all the lies, the shadow's arrived
And he won't shed a tear for our emptiness and fear
Blood will spill
I follow the hunt
Chase and kill
Follow the hunt
Blood will stain the land
As the hunt will take command
Tonight the grey one's arrived
To reveal all the lies,
Blood will spill
I follow the hunt
Chase and kill
Follow the hunt
Blood will spill
We follow the hunt
Chase and kill
We follow the hunt
Son Of The Last Breath: Part I -- Nattfödd, Part II -- Vedergällning
One night in November my soul found a heart
In glistening frost by the light of the stars
One night in November my soul found its home
In the glow of the moon I was born
All my grief washed away
It's the end of my plight
No mourning was left
Only feral delight
All my grief washed away
By the blood that was shed
In the glow of the moon I was born
Hide all trace
Count the days
Nine to reach my fate
Nine days t obring the change
Destiny fulfilled
Eight brings me sight
Seven gives me light
Six days and wounds are healed
Strength has returned
Bless the mighty Thor
Blood will stain your shores
Swear I will return
Prepare yourself for war
Praise the mighty Thor
Blood will stain your shores
Swear I will return
Prepare yourself for war
I will hide all trace
Count the days
Nine to reach my fate
Swear to return
Nine days to bring the change
Destiny fulfilled
Five proves me right
Four ends the fight
Three, two and one completes the change
Then I will rise
Iron Hand
You speak of hell and how you fell
Looking out for something new
You broke the law, you've seen it all
Really nothing more to tell
But you miss a vital piece - the key to everlasting power
Yes you lack the inner strength - a way to push them all aside
Steel will guide you right
Got to keep it locked inside you at all times - never let them see the way to climb
Rulel them all - feel the grip of an iron hand - take command
Rule them - to make it last and to remain, never let confusion reign
You speak of pain and always claim
You never really had a chance
But there's a call to break them all
Listen now or try in vain
There's a way to build the strength - a path to everlasting power
Summon up the right defense - and you'll break their will to fight
Steel will guide you right
Got to keep it locked inside you at all times, never let them see the way to climb
Rule them all - feel the grip of an iron hand - take command
Rule them - to make it last and to remain, never let confusion reign
Rule them all
Rule with an iron hand or you will fall
There's a lock inside the lonely cell, but we fail to find the key
There's a way to solve the riddles quick, but we always choose to leace
If the urge to hurt the weaker one gets stronger than before
Maybe wisdom leaves us all alone and we'll never break the door
If we refuse to take heed or learn - why would I stay or be concerned?
If the madness will spread like fire - why would I wish I could return?
There's a wall that separates us and divides
Hide the greed - put on a pleasant smile
Break the fall yet you're ashamed to be alive
Build a solid web of lies, web of lies
So we're pushing on for selfishness, while me march on forever blind
We develop as we sell our souls, and the connection is lost in time
If we refuse to take heed or learn - why would I stay or be concerned?
If the madness would spread like fire - why would I wish I could return?
There's a wall that separates us and divides
Hide the greed - put on a pleassant smile
Break the fall yet you're ashamed to be alive
Build a solid we b of lies, web of lies
No use in waiting for it - your kind will never understand
What separates us is a plan
There's a wall that separates us and divides
Hide the greed - put on a pleasant smile
Break the fall yet you're ashamed to be alive
Spin a solid web of lies, web of liesThe Quickening
Heart Of Storm
Rising from the ruins
Yet my mind is burning
Flames reflect those years of torment
Life that drowned in fire
Death was my desire
Path of hate was a relief for me
And then we stood there eye to eye
The darkest grief against a pure heart
Life baptised in metal By the secret of steel you are blessed, hail!!!
Gift of power helps you vanquish All the mortal's plagues
Heart of storm - I feel... the force is clean again
Heart of storm - deep inside of me
Heart of storm - and when I tear all roots of pain,
Heart of storm - grief and agony, then I'll be free
Hey! Ride on the wind!
Lightning pierced my body
Back again I'm rising
Now you hear my primal calling
Shout out even higher
War's now our revival!
Voice of truth is cryin' out for me
And now we're standing side by side
The tamed old hatreds next to mine
Watch me ride on the thunder
Followed by the warriors of steel, hail!!!
Strive for justice, fight for freedom
Yeah! This war is real!
Heart of storm - I know... the force is clean again
Heart of storm - all inside of me
Heart of storm - and now I kill all grief and pain
Heart of storm - Hey! And I kill the misery!
Now the force is clean again
All inside of me
And as I've killed all grief and pain
I crushed the agony, and now I'm free
And my heart of storm
I know... I know everything
I am everything
I'm alive
Sworn In Metal Wind
Walking in the shadow of life's dreary side
Fallen down memory lane
Winds whip the world, just like the woes whip my mind
Where is that time when "right now" was The words
When the heart burned with will like a flare
All I now keep is just damned commonplace misery
Hey man! What is this?!
Sounds like wail of a wimp
Did you let loser side take command?!
Where's the warrior in you
And the spirit he got
You say - "lost"
No! It's somewhere inside
And you know there's a force that unites all of us
Leave the wasteland we together will!
If you're broken, remember, you got faith within us!
Take now your next deep breath and revive
your old strength
Facing the abyss of heart's lonely grief
The bitch has polluted my soul
Rains flood the earth, just like the tears flood my eyes
Never again will my life be the same
Nothing can heal up my wounds
Guile and disgrace shall now follow me into the end
I just can not believe it
It's too weak to be true
Have you really forgotten your worth?!
Can't you see victory!?
You are now free again!
Look at me!
Yeah! I live my own life
If you once tasted treason from a female - leave that!
Every warrior has a gash on his sword
Don't forget you are metal, not some ass-kissing whore
Take some under your wings, but she must kiss the ring!
Winds of metal, make me once again
feel clear air's breath blowing in my wings!
I possess magic force
I am free in my words
Whole the world lays right below my feet
Life of duties and dogmas are just frames formed by rats
How'd I know?
Hey! I'm a guardian of truth
Now! Is really the time to wake up you old jade
Such as Phoenix spreads his firewings
I will help you remember by kicking your ass
And the will shall return
And again hearts shall burn
All the horns now will sing
Leading you back to the metal winds
The Song Of Air
World Through My Fateless Eyes
In the dawn of me, back at my spring of life
A mystic cry touched my soul
Just like a dream... a shine filled up it's sphere
My mind it was free and the secret's key was for me there
Magic voice that came... strain from another world
Of beauty not to believe
All then I heard was for me like a soul's reverie
And the voice... it sang my name
And through the all painful years that should come
That magic was there by my side
Power that led to I lost fear of death
Hatred that covered its meaning
I hail my senses that help me to see
so clear in my mind
All rotten "truth" and the doctrines which words
make us blind
I see the world through my fateless eyes
Pain be the sign, and the insight the guide
On this journey of unforeseen end
Enlightened by force of the unflagging faith
Through these wastelands I walk my own path
Damn the fate! You're one with your soul
and you must pave it's way by yourself
Out of nowhere the storm is coming on
The blare that surrounds helps me dream in
Enchanting me, while the spirit is rising again
And the storm... it sings my name
So as I walk on the path I believe
The force's always gracing my steps
Now in the name of the new risen will
I shall discomfit my fear!
And when the pinions of knowledge
like thunder, so mighty, will carry me on
All pain and grief and the weakness in me
shall be gone
I see the world through my fateless eyes
Perfect Warrior
I was falling into the boundless sea
I'm the sacred one who chose to change this world
Everything I hate to see...
Everyone I hate to hear...
Raise your sword and never fall again
I was calling, world never answered me
Time was standing still and life plunged into ruin
Everything I hate to see...
Everyone I hate to hear...
Hold your head up high and spread your words
Mob of "right", I despise your way of life!
I'm a "sinner", yet forgive me nothing
I'm a "heathen", but forever free
Remember!
If you try to break my wings
If you dare to watch my dreams
You'll forever bare your blame
In the name of pain
Remember!
If you try to break my wings
If you try to steal my dreams
You will never free your name
From the chains of pain
If you try to break my wings
If you dare to touch my dreams
Then my curse will be your pain
Denial Of Fate
Tribunal of senseless rabble
Built on fear and congruous prophecies
Twisting minds with planned hypocrisy
By the fools the clear're surrounded
Blind are deaf and deaf are blinded
Grant themselves the dream of destiny
Eternal path has not been "meant" for thee
The myth of fate you must tear by force
Get away!
Feel the taste of freedom, ride on wind
Let your mind see things world never seen
As you weed your life from the hope of fate
Find the way you shall within yourself
Clouds of might eclipse the horizon
Darkened sky as long as eye can see
Winds arise in wrath released by me
Now I spread the wings of fire
Flames of rage arise in power
The time has come to shed my burning will
Eternal path has not been "meant" for thee
The myth of fate you must tear by force
Get away!
Feel the taste of freedom, ride on wind
Let your mind see things world never seen
As you weed your life from the hope of fate
Find the way you shall within yourself
Feel the taste of freedom, ride on wind
Let your mind see things world never seen
As you weed your life from the hope of fate
Find the way you shall within yourself
Feel the taste of freedom, ride on wind
Let your mind see things world never seen
As you weed your life from the hope of fate
Find the way you shall within yourself
Welcome Back
Out of the sun, out of the night
Comes the morning light
Just another day breaks
Under the same sky
As the misty dawning fades away to its lair
Silence and peace fills the air
While this placid day reflects its calm
Feeling the chill of a distant zone
Hear the lost ones' cry from miles away
Wishing they were gone to another day
But the wishes give no hide
And the beasts you dread dwells in disguise
As the smoke covers my eyes
Mystic sight reveals
A doleful land among the shadows
Where only lost men go
Struggling in the night
Grief I see in their eyes
The sun is blackened while they fight
But the fire of hatred's rising high
The commands were only lies
Around me young men die
Welcome back, to the days of thunder!
Welcome back, to the days where you were born!
Welcome back, to break the spell you're under!
Welcome back, to the days of thunder!
Welcome back, to the days where you were born!
Welcome back, to raise again your honour!
What about the life...
that shined so bright once in your eyes?
What about the death... faith you lost...
so that was your quest?
What about the dreams...
there where no visions in your grief?
What about the fight...
that graced your life?
Water, fire, wind and soil
My soul came to be reborn
As the lightning thrashes black skies
The spirit fills my mind
Welcome back, to the days of thunder!
Welcome back, to the days where you were born!
Welcome back, to break the spell you're under!
Welcome back, to the days of thunder!
Welcome back, to the days where you were born!
Welcome back, to raise again your honour!
What about the life...
It shines so bright now in my eyes!
What about the death...
Faith I found, now life's my quest!
What about the dreams...
There're new visions in my grief!
What about the fight...
It graces my life!
Out of the fire
Out of the wind
Out of the water and soil
I'm reborn
The Kingdom Of My Will
Riding from wastelands
Black were their skies
My armour's still bleeding
Ripped by fire and ice
Watch the horseman wing out of the night
He's coming to save you, prepare! For now he arrives
Mounting through stormlands
With the wind in my hair
The spell I've broken...
...like the chains of despair
Share this flame that guides me in the dark
The spirit of metal, the legacy of our kind
To the kingdom of my will
From dungeons of emotions
Wisdom's voice is guiding me
Leads me through all tortures
Eyes of faith for me to see
The rotten deeds of liars
World that've turned to misery I brave
And the pure shall prevail
The misery I brave! Hey!
Led by that golden voice
Slaves of corruption
You'll fall by my hand
And all mindoppressors
Will be chased to the end
Fear the steel that's meant for all you rats!
The essence of insight, the truth,
that longs for your heads
To the kingdom of my will
From dungeons of emotions
Wisdom's voice is guiding me
Leads me through all tortures
Cross the life's unflagging sea
Through air I fly on thunder
Gift of force is meant for me
Refills my desolate shell
To the kingdom of my will
From dungeons of emotions
Wisdom's voice is guiding me
Leads me through all tortures
Forced to yield the hypocrites
But orders I'll not follow
Worms of lie surrounding me
Now see my wings of war!
The battle's confronting me
And for me... the battle has started again
Now see!
If you think I rest in wait
Until the fame will shine on me...
Through the mist I led myself!
The peak of dreams I reach by will!
Today is The Day!
Today is The Day!
Today is The Day!
Today is The Day!
Today is The Day!
Today is The Day!
Today is The Day!
Hey! You!
Hey!
If you think I rest in wait
Until the fame will shine on me...
Through the mist I led myself!
The peak of dreams I reach by will!
To the kingdom of my will
From dungeons of emotions
Wisdom's voice is guiding me
Leads me through all tortures
Cross the life's unflagging sea
Through air I fly on thunder
Gift of force is meant for me
Refills the chambers of my heart
On virgin soil serpents are born
Blind are their eyes, blinding's their bane
Feigned happiness real is as death
Hypocrites' plague infects the mind of man
There is that fear like a curse extending in veins
There is that torment that impairs thee
Roving in shadows
Yet with flame that glows in my heart
There on my way all alone, so alone, not alone
Only with eyes of a pure heart
Maybe some day you can see me
Faith be your guide when the sorrow encircles your self
Walking the path of a pure heart
Maybe someday you can meet me
Faith be your shine if the anguish eclipses your sight
Under the skin innocence breathes
Inherent grace, free from this waste
Insight and pain - sacred romance
Freedom not greed - a doubtless choice for me to make
There is a pureness that so real reveals in my dreams
There is a beauty that I long for
Covered by shadows, yet it's there so close in my sight
Waiting till shades are gone
Waiting till shades are gone...
Hailed shall be the ones who see what others can not
For no assumption I will waste my reason
The promised lands of sand are raised and troths build on tales
From heights I now behold the circus' credo
Solo: Equilibrian Epicurius
Solo: Trascendental Protagonist
Hailed shall be the ones who see what others can not
For no assumption I will waste my reason
The promised lands of sand are raised and troths build on tales
From heights I now behold the circus' credo
Only with eyes of a pure heart
Maybe some day you can see me
Faith be your guide when the sorrow encircles your self
Walking the path of a pure heart
Maybe someday you can meet me
Faith be your shine if the anguish eclipses your sight
Lost In The Depths Of Me
Down in the ashes wounded I crawl
Pray shall I not - god is gone
Lonely, but mighty, insight's my home
Into that shine now and again I will go
Stars gleam on my way, darkness chants for me
Into the depth I can see
Frozen, but conscious, spirit is my warmth
Wings of true will are carrying me through this world
But the world still is drowned in ecstasy
Of the fate and the myth of gods
But I doubt there's a journey planned for me
As I own every moment of my life
And the blessed they shall call it blasphemy
But I know what I think is right
Still the sun and the stars whill shine for me
For the pure I will fight
For no king I will die
For my thoughts I will live
Rambling in pain, drowning is sorrow, burning in hate
Why all this grief...
Chains not on me! I'm not a chosen one!!!
Fate for the mortals
Eyes for the searching ones
Don't dare you pray for me
When the faith is gone!
Lost in the depths of me
For the mind of the world I share my eyes
Truths' arms embrace these words
All the ones who lost their hope
Look deep in your ego - you'll find it there!
For the mind of the world
I share my breath
In mystic empathy
From the awe I healed my heart
And now as I tell this
I don't fear no more!
Rambling in pain, drowning is sorrow, burning in hate
Why all this grief...
Chains not on me! I'm not a chosen one!!!
Fate for the mortals
Eyes for the searching ones
Don't dare you pray for me
When the faith is gone!
Lost in the depths of me
Again Will The Fire Burn
Voices like wind...
Wordless their whispers...
I hear them!
Wandering alone, strayed form the path
Lost in the gales of despair
I see the shades wasting their last dreams
Hiding their woes... just for themselves
Only with fear as remains
Yet free you always can be
And dreams like ravens return
Some minds like diamonds survive
Again will the fire burn
Strain in the air...
Like crystal bells...
Now listen!
Deep in your mind search once again
Magical essence is there!
I brought my flame back from the shadows
Lost in the cold darks of this world
Will is the power I hail!
Yet free you always can be
And dreams like ravens return
Some minds like diamonds survive
Again will the fire burn
The Song Of Earth
Cry Of A Restless Soul
Hail to thee, Oh force of will
For awakening minds!
There for me from earliest days
Made this tale so mine
Storm...you almighty, earth, seas and flames
Here I am standing
Bare in my honesty
Calm in the moonshine
Starlight rests my eyes
Pain wakes me conscious
Truth guides my mind
Shine in my heart... strange colours embracing me
I'm not alone in a way
Wrath in my depths brings me to see I'm a warrior soul
Tortured minds... like a cloud they swarm around me
If I said my soul is screaming - would you believe in me!
Secret cry... hear the souls there howling, howling
While their salvation is so near
Deep inside it's always my time
All around it's only a world no one owns
Deep in heart it's always my time
Grief is nothing life should be
Never bend for misery!
Always standing
Always searching
Always free
Will is the power!
Strayed spirits before me, I see flames still burning
Hearts wounded, transformed
Yet not into grey, cold stones
Innocent days, life full of breath
That is the time I am crying for
Fly free again through virgin lands
That is the life I will fight for to regain
Turn around! All the founts you'll find behind you
If I said my heart is burning - would you believe in me!
Years flow by, still you drown is caustic memories
Embrace the best and face old grief
Deep inside it's always my time
All around it's only a world no one owns
Deep in heart it's always my time
Searching for a true relief
Finding life will be your first
Last one'll be your death
Cry of a restless soul
Hunting breeze of wasted bliss I am
For me and you I will catch it
In the dusk of banished mist you'll hear a waning moan
Cry of a restless soul
Think Not Forever
Waking up from a nameless decay
My life was is dream and my faith was in chains
Hypocrites kept me blind, still the Force is mine
Would it be in my heart to efface
Emotions for flesh and to stay out of doctrines' range
I am caught in a veil of illusions that haze my sight
If you think forever
Things will never change
When you find your sense again
You should follow its way
If you think forever
It is hard to see
When you find you truly believe
You should follow your spirit as your guide
Evolution in mind, heart and soul
Has brought me to see and to reach to my virgin glow
I have changed how to be, but it still is me
There is no one to stop my every strife
And all of my dreams now can be lived in life
I have learned how to see and believe in me, all time
If you think forever
Things will never change
When you find your sense again
You should follow its way
If you think forever
It is hard to see
When you find you truly believe
You should follow your spirit as your guide

He's the one, pure in his heart
Shining fair in the bliss never lost
Noble grace, innocent faith
Running throughout the fields immense
Shouting free in the air again
Dancing there with the wind
Sudden gust hit my face, burning rain tore the clouds
From depth of the gloaming thunder came
On a mountain I saw it
When lightning reached out for him
Enchanting my eyes... in magical rhapsody
On a mountain I watched him
As power filled up his veins
Surrounded by dusk
As the rain from the heavens was falling, falling...
And lone he might be on the ways of this world
His sword, sole companion, always there
On a mountain I watched him
When proudly he swung his steel
Entracing my heart... in mystical harmony
On a mountain I saw it
When knowledge aroused his sense
Encircled by clouds
In the gales now enlightened reborn
Wish I could fly through the land beloved
Not in my dream, nor by spell then bound
Paradise's here in the fields immense
Here is my life, not above!
How could I leave this place...
Wish I could fly through the land beloved
Not in my dream, nor by spell then bound
Paradise's here in the fields immense
If I return to this world here I will live again
Straightened by fury, I feel no fear
Fire inside, it keeps me awake
For no blind I ever shall bend!
This is my law! This is my way!
Hey!
Insight's my power, truth is my breath
Free in my thoughts I always remain!
Choose to take a different path
Strong in the storms, pure through the waste
Stand up, Oh brothers over the world!
Enemies are there and mostly the same
We are a kind that never gives in!
We are a flame born in the wind!
Hey!
Time's of no matter, it never was!
World is the same, just different form
Freedom is something one doesn't earn
Always your own! Graced by the will!
He's the one, pure in his heart
Shining fair in the pride never lost
Noble grace, unbroken faith
Running throughout the fields immense
Shouting free in the air embraced
Dancing there with the windDark Avenger
He broke the laws of the elders
So they plucked out his eye,
Took his land and fortune,
Left him to die
Bound on the shoreline,
Left for the tide,
Sees his life-blood leaving...
Circling lower, the vultures fly
His bones may be broken
But the spirit can't die
And the Gods see his anguish
And give him a sign
From the floor of the ocean
The ship of the lost souls rise
And they take him where no one sleeps while the undead cry,
Where no one sleeps while the undead cry...
And in the world above
The elders sing,
On his land they live...
Let death's bell ring
He was met at the gate of Hades
By the Guardian of the Lost Souls,
The Keeper of the Unavenged
And He did say to him,
"Let ye not pass Abaddon
Return to the world
From whence you came
And seek payment
Not only for thine own anguish
But to vindicate the souls
Of the Unavenged."
And they placed in his hands
A sword
Made for him
Called Vengeance
Forged in brimstone
And tempered
By the woeful tears of the unavenged
And to carry him up on his journey
Back to the upper world
They brought forth
Their Demon horse
Called: Black Death
A grim steed
So fiersome in might
And black in colour
That he could stand as one with the darkness...
Save from his burning eyes
of crimson fire
And on that night
They rode up from Hell
The pounding of his hooves
Did clap like thunder!
Burning, death, destruction
Raping the daughters and wives
In blood I take my payment
In full with their lives
No one can escape me
On Black Death I ride
When kissed by the sword of Vengeance
Your head lays there by your side
I take the lives of all that I once knew
The torn flesh of a slow death waits for you
Burning, death, destruction
Raping the daughters and wives
In blood I take my payment
In full with their lives
I spare not land or servants
My wake is smoke and flame
I take their wives and daughters
They stand there watching, watching
Hoping to gain their lives
But when I'm through they know that they must pay
Burning, death, destruction
Raping the daughters and wives
In blood I take my payment
In full with their lives
With their lives
With their lives
With their lives
William's Tale
Battle Hymns
By moonlight we ride
Ten thousands side by side
With swords drawn held high
Our whips and armour shine
Hail to thee our infantry
Still brave beyond the grave
All have sworn the eternal vow
The time to strike is now
Kill, kill, Oh !
Kill, kill, Oh !
Kill, kill, Oh !
Kill, kill, Oh !
Gone are the days when freedom shone
Now blood and steel meet bone
In the light of the battle's way
The sands of time will shake
How proud our soldiers stand
With mace and chain in hand
Sound the charge into glory ride
Over the top of the vanguished pride
Victory, victory, Oh !
Victory, victory, Oh !
Victory, victory, Oh !
Victory, victory, Oh !
To the battle we ride
We crossed a starlit sky
No space no time
We'll catch the wind
Strange losses, men died
We crossed a starlit sky
And still no space or time
We'll catch the wind
Kill, kill, Oh !
Kill, kill, Oh !
Kill, kill, Oh !
Kill, kill, Oh !
Sound of charge into glory ride
Over the top of the anguished pride
By moonlight we ride
Ten thousand side by side
Kill, kill, Oh !
Kill, kill, Oh !
Kill, kill, Oh !
Kill, kill, Oh !
Secret Of Steel
Atop the mountain, where the river of steel flows
Black is the forest, white was the snow.
There as children, how could children know?
One without name or number soon would show.
There stood he, on his chariot made of gold
He did reveal the trinity of secrets old.
A sceptre of iron could mercy bring.
A shield of gold, the Creator and king,
And the great sword of steel.
Sons of destiny shall wield.
Hear Wisdom's voice.
Rise, know the strength that you feel.
Hold in your heart but never reveal.
You were called by the Gods, their powers to wield.
Guard well the secret of steel.

Gates Of Valhalla
Valhalla the gods await me
Open wide thy gates embrace me.
Great hall of the battle slain
With sword in hand.
All those who stand on shore
Raise high your hands to bid a last
farewell to the Viking land.
Death's chilling wind blows through my hair
I'm now immortal, I am there
I take my place by Odin's side
Eternal army in the sky.
I point my hatchet to the wind
I guard the gates and all within
Hear my sword sing, as I ride across the sky
Sworn by the sacred blood of Odin onward ride.

Hatred
I taste your blood as it showers from my blade
I eat your heart, from evil it was made
With heart filled hatred black blood runs through my veins.
I take your powers to the ancient ones who reign
I conquer evil, let evil know my name
Come forth ye wicked, know the gruesome pain
I am the omen, the one that cannot die
I am the flame, hatred burns inside.
My strength is hatred, torment and pain, HATRED, HATRED
With heart filled hatred black blood runs through my veins.
I crush your bones, I kill your face
I rip your flesh, I end the chase
You meet with terror, you draw the ace
I rule the world the rats that race.
My strength is hatred, torment and pain, HATRED, HATRED
With heart filled hatred black blood runs through my veins.
HATRED
Revelation (Death's Angel)
Above the wreckage of your mortal world I stand
Judgement passed delivered by his hand
Now clear the smoke, there the ashes stand
A fitting tribute to mortality and man.
What was written foretold in dreams,
in visions apocalypse now seen.
And all self-righteous fools who lived and blasphemed
Drink the wine of his anger
Die with the beast
Vindication, he is coming on the clouds
See his angels, hear their trumpets sound.
The day of anger when the stars fall from the sky
The moon turns red, the sun turns black as night.
Know the end is coming, heed this sign
By the morning star the four horsemen ride.
Revelation, the chosen saved
Earth be cleansed in a blaze
Armageddon, the first trumpet blows
Hail, fire and blood fall on Satan's throne.
His hair as white as wool, his eyes like burning flame
He is the first and last, he brings the seven plagues
Seven stars of seven cities in his hand
He holds the keys of death for the underworld and man
Know the end is coming, heed this sign
By the morning star he four horsemen ride
Revelation, the chosen saved
Earth be cleansed in a blaze
Armageddon, the first trumpet blows
Hail, fire and blood fall on Satan's throne.
Revelation, the chosen saved
Earth be cleansed in a blaze
Armageddon, the first trumpet blows
Hail, fire and blood fall on Satan's throne.
March For Revenge (By The Soldiers Of Death)
Ride, Ride, Ride, Ride Up From Hell
Armed with magic sons of demons and men
This song of greeting written for your tragic end.
So long our stride the world doth tremble with fear
Black winds blow where we ride near.
Maim and kill them, take the women and children.
Hot pitch and chain take to the air
Our ramming blades lay their ships hold bare.
Steel meets steel, axes, broadsword and shield.
Their heads ride our spears and bodies cover the fields.
Maim and kill them, take the women and children.
Fallen brother as I hold closed your side
I fear this wound your last.
Mighty earth now doth drink your blood
And I remember days long past.
Your sacrifice so great, rest now take thy sleep
For you shall not awake, let revenge be sweet.
For when we march, your sword rides with me.
For when we march, your sword rides with me.
For when we march, your sword rides with me.
For when we march, your sword rides with me.
You who killed my brother and all who take your side
This be your last hour. Let your steel be tried.
Now turn to face me upon the timeless plane
Kill me if you can.
Death is life!
By the full moon they rise from their graves.
Through seas of blood, fighting with hell bent rage.
Swear the creed of unity, by the circle of blood
We are one, we know not fear! Born to fight not run.
Maim and kill them, take the women and children.
Blood Of My Enemies
Three sons have I, and they
Ride by my side. The fierce,
The black, and the wicked are
their names-we ride down my
enemies on their half-hearted flight.
No voice of mercy-no evangels of light.
Mighty messengers-heathens rage
Witness our coming-gods of the dead.
I ride through the air-
I laugh as I die-with powers of evel
Dark knowledge is mine.
The ride of the wicked-
The firstst sin was trust.-
Kill without warning-for blood now
I lust
Strong wind-magic mist
To Asgard the Valkries fly
High overhead-they carry the dead
Where blood of my enemies lies.
Three sons have I,and they
Ride by my side.-The fierce,
The  black,and the wicked are
their names-we ride down my
enemies on their half-hearted flight.
No voice of mercy-no evangels of light.
Strong wind-magic mist
To Asgard the Valkries fly
High overhead-they carry the dead
Where blood of my enemies lies.
Each Dawn I Die
Passing through the storm-
Led by Demons-walk between the
World of men and gods-
Cast no shadows-draw no light.
I rape the priestess on pagans night.
I taste the serpents poison
On the lips of the one I love.
She brings this gift of witchcraft.
I wear the cat-skin-gloves.
Apples of youth when I wrought
Mischief,hung in a tree to rot
In the sun.-
Reborn in the middle of the
Final orgy the gift of slavery
To the chosen one.
Suicide Suicide don't you know
Me-call to the Master-he will
Come.-He will bring out
Ressurection-cloaked in darkness-
He has won.
Smoke of my sacrifice.-
Journey to the Isle of the
Blessed.-
Grant my soul your glory.
At night time-I'm your guest.
Only I know why-
Each dawn I die.
Smoke of my sacrifice.-
Journey to the Isle of the
Blessed.-
Grant my soul your glory.
At night time-I'm your guest.
Only I know why-
Kill With Power
Hear what's written on the wind.
We come to kill and kill again.
Our arrows fall like hail
Trample on the dead-Ride through the
Gate of clouds-stand on the open step
Run berserk-spreading fear and pain
Black shield and weapons, black our chain.
None can harm us-not their fire-
Iron or steel-for we have the
Will to power-with power we will
Kill
Kill with power-die die
Kill with power-die die
To the war god Odin you will pray
And the curse of weapons shell
Remain.On the blood of all our
Fathers-on their weapons we now
Swear to evenge-not lament.
Give the False ones death.
Kill with power-die die
Kill with power-die die

Army Of The Immortals
Battle hymns did sound the call.
You came to our side.
You heard true metal
Into glory ride.

You stood beside us,
The false ones cries.

We give you our blood, we want you to know.
In our eyes you're immortal
In our hearts you'll live forever
In our eyes you're immortal
In our hearts you'll live forever more.
We have read your letters, we have heard your call.

To play the loudest metal, so hard and wild and mean.
You'll live forever, we were born from your belief.

be a black arrow of death
sent straight to the hearts
of all those who play false metal

Bridge Of Death
Slowly crossing as the river runs below
Never stopping for whats waiting soon will slow
And this last time looking back I'll see
My home for he awaits me reaching for my
soul.He calls my name,and waves me on
The fallen one he stands in flame
Well the life that he has given full of riches
And success has a price that I made good in
Blood to pay.And the light he now is showing
To guide my every footstep is insurance if
I falter on my way.And what God has now
Forsaken and man has never seen are the
Riches of the underworld below all my
Years of earthly pleasures gave support
Unto the briges I now cross it giving
Him my soul
Dark Lord,I summon thee demanging the
Sucred right to burn in hell,ride up to hells
hot wind.Face one more evilthan thou,take
My lustful soul,
Drink my blood as I drink yours,impale me on
the horns of death
Cut off my head release all my evel Lucifer is king
Praise Satan
I know the one who waits satan is
His name,is across the bridge of
Death there he stands in flame
I know the one who waits satan is
His name,is across the bridge of
Death there he stands in flame.
He is my provider as I walk into the
Void for eternity I give to him my soul
I shall do his bidding obey him
Without question even walk among the living if
I'm told
Satan don't forsake me I wait for
You take me grant me wings and as
You messenger I'll fly.
Thor (The Powerhead)
Black clouds on the horizon
Great thunder and burning rain
His chariot pounding, I heard the heavens scream his name
I watched as he shouted
To the giants that died that day
He held up his hammer high and called Odin for a sign
Thor the mighty, Thor the brave
Crush the infidels in your way
By your hammer let none be saved
Live to die on that final day
Gods, monsters and men
We'll die together in the end
God of thunder, God of rain
Earth shaker who feels no pain
The powerhead of the universe
Now send your never ending curse
I watched as he shouted
To the giants that died that day
He held up his hammer high and called Odin for a sign
Thor the mighty, Thor the brave
Crush the infidels in your way
By your hammer let none be saved
Live to die on that final day
Gods, monsters and men
We'll die together in the end
Swing your hammer to crack the sky
Lift your cape so that you might fly
Back to Odin and gods on high
And leave this mortal world
Thor the mighty, Thor the brave
Crush the infidels in your way
By your hammer let none be saved
Live to die on that final day
Gods, monsters and men
We'll die together in the end
Odin
Mountains
So tall, silent against the sky
Up through the clouds, where eagles fly
Wind and rain beat down on one so strong
They cut but never change, what stood so long
Tall  as a mountain, I'm gonna tear through the sky
Life's for the taking
Like a man is a mountainside
Greatness waits for those who try
None can teach you, it's all inside
Just climb
I'm in the ground, I'm in the air, I'm all
I live in the hearts of all men
I'm the call to greatness
Not all can hear
I awaken the creator, in those who dare
And the day will come, when we all must die
And enter the mountainside
Tall as a mountain, I'm gonna tear through the sky
Life's for the taking
Like a man is a mountainside
Greatness waits for those who try
None can teach you, it's all inside
Just climb
I have no fear
Death and glory
Both draw near
Like a man is a mountainside
Greatness waits for those who try
None can teach you, it's all inside
Just climb
Sign Of The Hammer
The spell has been broken, the curse has been lifted
Black is the wind on the heels of the gifted
Four sworn to vengeance, see the hate in our eyes
Called by the gods and given a sign
Onward pounding into glory ride
Sign of the hammer, be my guide
Final warning all stand aside
Sign of the hammer, it's my time

Those who denied us are delivered instead
Into the hands of four sworn to ride

Onward pounding into glory ride
Sign of the hammer, be my guide
Final warning all stand aside
Sign of the hammer, it's my time
The spell has been broken, the curse has been lifted

Called by the gods and given a sign
Onward pounding into glory ride
Sign of the hammer, be my guide
Final warning all stand aside
Old man and young boys, it's my time
Sign of the hammer, it's my time
The Oath
Burning embers of the second death will come in the night
Priests and kings, the alpha and omega, poison bites
False prophets and deceivers, swing from the trees
Now dawn the age of birds
Drunk with blood, like lepers with disease
Lord of the sky, mercury the guide
Lord of the underworld, I swear the sacred rite
I will crucify, slay them with their tribe
Hear my war cry
They'll find no sanctuary hidden in their ancestral halls
Let loose the knot that binds
The spirit and flesh, let it fall
For only courage and heroism linger after death
So, hold fast thy sword, rejecting pain, feel the dragons breath
Lord of the sky, mercury the guide
Lord of the underworld, I swear the sacred rite
I will crucify, slay them with their tribe
Hear my war cry
I've sworn the oath
I've sworn the oath
I've sworn the oath
Lord of the sky, mercury the guide
Lord of the underworld, I swear the sacred rite
I will crucify, slay them with their tribe
Hear my war cry
Burning embers of the second death will come in the night
Priests and kings, the alpha and omega, poison bites
False prophets and deceivers, swing from the trees
Now dawn the age of birds
Drunk with blood, like lepers with disease
Lord of the sky, mercury the guide
Lord of the underworld, I swear the sacred rite
I will crucify, slay them with their tribe
Hear my war cry
I've sworn the oath
I've sworn the oath
I've sworn the oath
Achilles, Agony, And Ecstasy (In Eight Parts)
I see my chariot run to your ships
I'll drive you back to the sea
You came here for gold
The wall will not hold
This day was promised to me
The gods are my shield
My fate has been sealed
Lightning and javelins fly
Soon many will fall
We are storming the wall
Stones fall snow from the sky
We will pay with our glory
In the fire of battle
Zeus today is mine
Killing all my way
Like sheep and like cattle
Smashing skulls of all who defy
I spare not the hammer
I spare not the sword
This day will ring with my name
None have to chase me
Let he who will face me
Kill me or die by the sword
Oh friend of mine, how to say goodbye
This was your time, but the armor you wore
Was mine, I will not rest
Until Hector's blood is spilled
His bones will all be broken
Dragged across the field
This dear friend is how we'll say goodbye
Until we meet in the sky
Here is inside the walls Troy, the gods weigh my fate
From this day do I abstain, to a memory of hate
To pay for all the blood that spilled
The many thousands I did kill,
No walls can contain the gods' almighty will
I hear the silent voices I cannot hide
The gods leaves no choices so we all must die
Oh Achilles let thy arrows fly.
Into the wind, where eagles cross the sky
Today my mortal blood will mix with sand
It was foretold I will die by thy hand
Into Hades my soul descend
Cowards in the grip of fear, no valour to uphold
Cut into the earth, with honor long been sold
For all shall come to know me
As they fall unto their knees
Zeus the Thunderer, control my destiny
When the cards of life were dealt,
My hand a ruthless fate
To avenge, and bringeth fury, Hector feel my hate
A bloodbath was born to bring, by birth I'm an assassin
To cut the cord of life and beath,
Ties to earth unfasten
Blood and fire death and hate, your body I will desecrate
Dogs and vultures eat your flesh the hall of Hades waits
Kill...
Hector's blood lies on the battlefield
His body lies on the battlefield
His body's mangled wounds,
The gods who once protected him are now his gods of doom,
Like a tower standing tall, steadfest in direction
I fall upon you bringing death, the gods give no protection
Coward in the grip of fear, no valour to uphold
Cut into the earth, with honor long been sold
For all shall come to know me, as they fall ino their knees
Zeus the Thunderer, control my destiny
Blood and fire death and hate, you body I will desecrate
Dogs and vultures eat your flesh the hall of Hades waits
Die, die, die...
The oath of the gods, this day was fulfilled
In the heat of the battle, Hector was killed
See him Patroclus, down in the dust
Rejoice in his death my symbol of trust
A dozen highborn youths, have been killed
Cutting their throats their blood was all spilled
Their bodies set at the fool of your fire
With oxen, sheep and two of your hounds
Your funeral pyre high off the ground
Hector's body dragged three times around
I will carry the torch to your funeral pyre
I will ask of the wind to send high your fire
Hector's blood will not be washed from my body until your body is burned
A prophecy spoken a promice fulfilled
More blood will be spilled, more will be killed.

Ride The Dragon
Demon's blood and dragon fire, falling on my wings
Racing to the battle in the sky
Ancient gods are calling me I hear them when they sing
Of all the heroes who wait for me to die
Beneath the cloak of magic, I'll meet them in the air
I am invisible, I move without a sound
They look but cannot find me, they think that I'm not there
With a spell I send them crashing to the ground
Wait for me dragon, we'll meet in the sky by fire and magic I am sworn
Hell is calling! We cannot be denied fly to the blackness of the storm
We must die to be reborn
I wear a sacred talisman, I make a secret sign
Now welcome me into this wicked wind
On the journey of a shaman a dragon I must ride
The gates of hell are open! Let me in!
Rule in hell or serve in heaven choose an altar or throne
All Commandments and the laws of man disown
Now eat the fruit of knowledge unto no one ye atone
Into the fire with your soul!
Wait for me dragon, we'll meet in the sky by fire and magic I am sworn
Hell is calling! We cannot be denied fly to the blackness of the storm
We must die to be reborn
Demon's blood and dragon fire, falling on my wings Racing to the battle in the sky
Ancient gods are calling me I hear them when they sing
Of all the heroes who wait for me to die
Beneath the cloak of magic, I'll meet them in the air
I am invisible, I move without a sound
They look but cannot find me, they think that I'm not there
With a spell I send them crashing to the ground
Wait for me dragon, we'll meet in the sky by fire and magic I am sworn
Hell is calling! We cannot be denied fly to the blackness of the storm
We must die to be reborn
Spirit Horse Of The Cherokee
The trail of tears began for all the Cherokee
The white men came to trade & borrow but then they would not leave
Some of us were taken by boat, and died at sea
Those of us who lived were sold to slavery
We welcomed them as brothers knowing nothing of their greed
Born hunters not the hunted as the white man hunts for me
We are descendants of the animals we live among the free
Our trail of tears would end one day at Wounded Knee.
Great Spirit, thunder birds fly, we are wild and free
To fight and die by the open sky, Spirit Horse ride for me
When we do the Ghost Dance, the buffalo will return
Paint ourselves for war, now blood and fire burn
Great Spirit makes us strong, take us to the sky
The Cherokee are brave, we are not afraid to die
Great Spirit, thunder birds fly, we are wild and free
To fight and die by the open sky, Spirit Horse ride for me
Red Cloud, Black Hawk, Sitting Bull, Crazy Horse, Geronimo
Strong and brave warriors to the grave
There has been much killing there will be much more
The Medicine Man is dancing he's calling us to war,
Hatchets sing with pride let the white men die
Great Spirit, thunder birds fly, we are wild and free
To fight and die by the open sky, Spirit Horse ride for me
Burning
We have come from the ashes of the burning away
Pouring blood in the fire on the altar of pain
Led into temptation, now the black gods align
Here there is no salvation and your blood is my wine.
Here's a world that is waiting between the living and the dead
Here the flesh and its pleasure are eternally wed
All is all for the taking for a life of a lie
At the end of the breaking I'll be watching you die.
Crawl to the silence renounce and deny,
The stars and the numbers foretold of this time,
To the words and the wisdom too the promise of lies
By their anger and fury the strong will survive.
The Power Of Thy Sword
Lord of battle I pray on bended knee conquest by the rising sun
I'll wait for thy command with flame and blood at hand
glory and a broken sword.
I'm the master of the world I have no fear of man or beast
Born inside the soul of the world
Riding hard breaking bone with steel and stone
Eternal might I was born to wield.
Let us drink to the battles we've lived and we've fought
Celebrate the pain and havoc we have wrought
Great heroes charge into the fight
From the north to the south in the black of night
The clash of honor calls to stand when others fall
Gods of war feel the power of my sword
Drink to the battles we've lived and we've fought
Celebrate the pain and havoc we have wrought
Great heroes charge into the fight
From the north to the south in the black of night
Fierce is my blade fierce is my hate born to die in battle
I laugh at my fate
Now pay in blood when your blood has been spilled
You're never forgiven death is fulfilled !
The clash of honor calls to stand when others fall
Gods of war feel the power of my sword
The clash of honor calls
I will stand when others fall
Open magic doors
The will know the power of my sword
There is blood in my hands there is blood in my eyes
With blood in my voice I scream as you die
Thirsting for vengeance and mounds of the slain
Shaking the forest onto the plain
Fierce is my blade fierce is my hate born to die in battle
I laugh at my fate
Now pay in blood when your blood has been spilled
You're never forgiven death is fulfilled !
The clash of honor calls to stand when others fall
Gods of war feel the power of my sword
The Demon's Whip
Black candles slowly burning, white fangs and flashing eyes
Hell's wind and incantations summon living fire,
Darkest forces and your demon's black order, black king
The cult that serves the living, accept this offering
Black candles slowly burning, white fangs and flashing eyes
Hell's wind and incantations summon living fire,
As the seven steps await, hear the great bell toll
With a dead man's bones conjure, the enemy of the soul
From the misery and sadness, of the molten seas of hell
Mystic love and mystic symbols in evil dreams there dwell
Darkest forces and your demon's black order, black king
The cult that serves the living, accept this offering
A deadly drink, a meal of hearts, now sacrifice and die
In darkness and destruction, behold the evil eye
And the Demon's whip
Armies of the gods of hell ride across the astral plane
Bearing curses of destruction, sworn beyond the grave
Children of the darkness, all born but to deceive
By the ancient code of evil grant not one reprieve
In the place where evil dwells death can live when all life dies
Wage eternal war on heaven immortal hate below the sky
Your scripture and your sermons, are leaves born on the wind
To heal the unrepentant one needs a greater sin
Night winds, Oblivion see my dark desire
Come forth, appear he is living fire
Feel the Demon's whip
Armies of the gods of hell ride across the astral plane
Bearing curses of destruction, sworn beyond the grave
Children of the darkness, all born but to deceive
By the ancient code of evil grant not one reprieve
In the place where evil dwells death can live when all life dies
Wage eternal war on heaven immortal hate below the sky
Your scripture and your sermons, are leaves borne on the wind
To heal the unrepentant one needs a greater sin
Feel the Demon's whip
Master Of The Wind
In the silence of the darkness when all are fast asleep
I live inside a dream calling to your spirit
As a sail calls the wind, hear the angels sing
Far beyond the sun across the western sky
Reach into the blackness find a silver line
In a voice I whisper a candle in the night
We'll carry all our dreams in a single beam of light
Close your eyes, look into the dream
Winds of change will winds of fortune bring
Fly away to a rainbow in the sky gold is at the end for each of us to find
There the road begins where another one will end
Here the four winds know who will break and who will bend
All to be the master of the wind
Falling stars now light my way
My life was written on the wind
Clouds above, clouds below
High ascend the dreams within
When the wind fills the sky the clouds will move aside
And there will be the road to all our dreams
For any day that stings two better days it brings
Nothing is as bad as it seems
Close your eyes, look into the dream
Wins of change will winds of fortune bring
Fly away to a rainbow in the sky gold is at the end for each of us to find
There the road begins where another one will end
Here the four winds know who will break and who will bend
All to be the master of the wind

Build a fire a thousand miles away to light my long way home
I ride a comet
My trail is long to stay
Silence is a heavy stone...
I fight the world and take all they can give
There are times my heart hangs low
Born to walk against the wind
Born to hear my name
No matter where I stand I'm alone
Stand and fight
Live by your heart
Always one more try
I'm not afraid to die
Stand and fight
say what you feel
Born with a heart of steel
Burn the bridge behind you
Leave no retreat
There's only one way home
Those who laugh and crowd the path
And cut each other's throats
Will fall like melting snow
They'll watch us rise with fire in our eyes
They'll bow their heads
Their hearts will hang low
Then we'll laugh and they will kneel
And know this heart of steel was
Too hard to break
Too hard to hold
Stand and fight
Live by your heart
Always one more try
I'm not afraid to die
Stand and fight
Say what you feel
born with a heart of steel

Hail And Kill
Brothers I am calling from the valley of the kings
With nothing to atone
A dark march lies ahead, together we will ride
Like thunder from the sky
May your sword stay wet like a young girl in her prime
Hold your hammers high
Blood and death are waiting like a raven in the sky
I was born to die
Hear me while I live
As I look into your eyes
None shall hear a lie
Power and dominion are taken by the will
By divine right hail and kill
Hail, Hail, Hail, Hail and Kill, Hail and Kill
Hail, Hail, Hail, Hail and Kill, Hail and Kill
My father was a wolf
I'm a kinsman of the slain
Sworn to rise again
I will bring salvation, punishment and pain
The hammer of hate is our faith
Power and dominion are taken by the will
By divine right hail and kill
Hail, Hail, Hail, Hail and Kill, Hail and Kill
Hail, Hail, Hail, Hail and Kill, Hail and Kill
Rip their flesh
Burn their hearts
Stab them in the eyes
Rape their women as they cry
Kill their servants
Burn their homes
Till there's no blood left to spill
Hail and Kill
Power and dominion are taken by the will
By divine right hail and kill
Hail, Hail, Hail, Hail and Kill, Hail and Kill
The Warriors Prayer
It was my thirteenth year on a cold winter's
day, as I walked through the enchanted forest,
I heard the sound of horses and men at arms,
I felt compelled to walk on and find the place
of these sounds, and when the forest did clear
I was standing on a hill. Before me, (there?)
was a great plain. Upon it, the armies of the
world, standing, waiting. I thought to myself,
for whom or for what are they waiting ?
Suddenly a gust of wind came up from the north.
There appeared a lone rider, holding a sword
of steel. Then from the south came another,
bearing a battle ax. From the east came a third,
holding a spiked club. And finally, from the west,
a rider who wielded a great hammer of war.
With them came their soldiers of death, followed
by an army of immortals. They were few in number,
but the look in their eyes told all who beheld
them that they would leave this day only in
victory or death. And there was a great silence...
My heart began to pound, storm clouds filled
the sky with darkness, rain came, and the four
winds blew with such anger that I held fast to
a tree. I watched the four riders raise their
weapons into the air. Without warning, screaming
their war cry. They led the attack, down to
the battle they rode. They met the armies of
the world with a mighty clash ! I could feel
the ground shake, the earth drank much blood
that day ! Each of the four, was unto himself,
a whirlwind of doom !!!!!!!!!!
When the smoke did clear, many thousands
were dead. There was much blood and gore.
Their bodies lay broken and scattered across
the battlefield, like brown leaves blown by
the wind. And I saw the four ride together
to the top of the hill, while below them the
soldiers of death assembled, all those who
would now swear allegiance to them. And the
four spoke the words of the warriors prayer...
Gods of war I call You. My sword is by my side.
I seek a life of honor, free from all false pride.
I will crack the whip with a bold mighty hail.
Cover me with death if I should ever fail.
Glory, Majesty, Unity
Hail, Hail, Hail
And as I stood and looked on, I heard the
armies of the world hail them without end, and
their voices of victory carried long and far
throughout the land !

King
Now is the time to reach for the sky
Gather the wind hear the voice to fly
To know why they sing about heroes and kings
Who were brave and not afraid to die
Look and you'll see that a new day will bring
The will to go on and fight through endless suffering
For all who believe wait a crown a ring
The power of the man who would be king
The power of the man who would be king
Into the fight of hopes and dreams
The master of the wind knows nothing's what is seems
The melting of the soul the wish of those who scheme
The taking of the will by destroyers of the dream
They live to spread the fear of the wrong of right of self
They want us all to live like books upon a shelf
But we know we have the power to fight and make a stand
Strike when we are challenged all across the land to be king
Fight for the crown, fight for the ring
We're fighting the world, we fight for the king
Time to face the world let brothers never fight
Forever forge ahead and keep the dream in sight
For those who never try they are sure to fail
The heart's a righteous wind that comes to fill the sail
For the glory of the king we fight to stay alive
By the power of the will, the spirit to survive to be king
Fight for the crown, fight for the ring
We're fighting the world, we fight for the king

Freedom to bring a thought to the wing is waiting to unfold

Fight for the crown, fight for the ring
We're fighting the world, we fight for the king
For the glory of the king we fight to stay alive - Fight
By the power of the will the spirit to survive - Fight
Across the gates of Heaven beyond the gates of Hell - Fight
We fought to stay together
We have won and have lived to tell who would be king
Fight for the crown, fight for the ring
We're fighting the world, we fight for the king
Today Is A Good Day To Die
My Spirit Lives On
The Power
I've got the power to fly into the wind
The power to be free to die and live again
This power's like fire, fire loves to burn
Make the world a grave of ashes in an urn
The power in the darkness to see without my sight
Walk among the living free of wrong and right
The power of the magic the power of the spell
Not to serve in Heaven but one day to rule in Hell
Power the power the power
This power's greater than love and of hate
This is the power of will and of fate
The power to kill the power to feel
The power of blood the triumph of steel
Greater that the power of a priest or a sinner
The power to defy to fight and be the winner
The power of the demons spirits I command
Always by my side to serve the master's plan
Power the power the power
None can fight the power none can fight the wind
Secrets of all life and death are carried there within
Call out to the power of the darkness and light
Have dominion of the earth be lord of all the night
Kill all those who stand against you look into their eyes
Drink their blood and laugh as they pay for all their lies
Piss upon their graves then cast a final spell
Fly into the night and one day meet in Hell
Power the power the power
Call To Arms
When they see us they will run for their lives
To the end they will pay for their lies
So long did we wait, now we are home
Here once again there's a battle to fight
Gather together for the sound and the might
So long did we wait, now we are home
Now we will fight for the kingdom, fighting with steel
Kill all of them, their blood is our seal
Fight till the last of the enemy is dead
Ride through their blood that we gladly have shed
I now issue the call, are you ready to fight - yeah
Fight altogether as one for the right
To be free once again - tonight we will win
I can see by the look that you have in your eyes
You came here for metal, to fight and to die
Defenders of steel, now we are home
Fight for the kingdom bound for glory
Armed with a heart of steel
I swear by the brothers who stand before me
To no man shall I kneel
Their blood is upon my steel
Fight For Freedom
There's a sound heard across the land
It's heard across the sea
You'll only hear it if you listen with your hearts
And one day hope to be free
To hear the sound of freedom many gave their lives
They fought for you and me
Those memories will always live inside us
And now it's our time to be free
Where the eagles fly - I will soon be there
If you want to - come along with me my friend
Say the words and you'll be free
From the mountains to the sea
We'll fight for freedom again
Scream out loud for all the world to hear
From sea to shining sea ??
Let freedom ring and every man be king
To live as one through the years
Now is the time we all must stand together
So raise your hands show them we are strong
Side by side the fight goes on forever
Marching to the battle with this song
Valhalla
Swords In The Wind
I surrender my soul
Odin hear my call
One day I'll sit beside your throne
In Valhalla's great hall
Like so many before me
I'll die with honor and pride
The right of the warrior
Forever to fight by your side
Send a sign, raise the sail
Wave a last goodbye
Destiny is calling
Immortality be mine
Call the witch to cast the runes
Weave a magic spell
We who die in battle are born
Not for heaven, not for hell
We are sons of Odin
The fire we burn inside
Is the legacy of warrior kings
Who reign above in the sky
I will lead the charge
My sword into the wind
Sons of Odin fight
To die and live again
Viking ships cross the sea
In cold wind and rain
Sail into the black of night
Magic stars our guiding light
Today the blood of battle
Upon my weapons will never dry
Many I'll send into the ground
Laughing as they die
Place my body on a ship
And burn it on the sea
Let my spirit rise
Valkiries carry me
Take me to Valhalla
Where my brothers wait for me
Fires burn into the sky
My spirit will never die
An American Trilogy
Oh I wish I was in the land of cotton
Old times they are not forgotten
Look away, look away, look away Dixie land
Oh I wish I was in Dixie away, away
In Dixie land I'll take my stand
To live and die in Dixie
Dixie land where I was born
Early Lord one frosty morning
Look away, look away, look away Dixie land
Glory, glory, hallelujah
Glory, glory, hallelujah
Glory, glory, hallelujah
This truth is marching on
So hush little baby, don't you cry
You know your daddy's bound to die
All my trials Lord will soon be over
Glory, glory, hallelujah
This truth is marching on
This truth is marching on
The March
Warriors Of The World (United)
Here our soldiers stand from all around the world
Waiting in a line to hear the battle cry
All are gathered here, victory is near
The sound will fill the hall, bringing power to us all
We alone are fighting for metal that is true
We own the right to live the fight, we're here for all of you
Now swear the blood upon your steel will never dry
Stand and fight together beneath the battle sky
Brothers everywhere - raise your hands into the air
We're warriors, warriors of the world
Like thunder from the sky - sworn to fight and die
We're warriors, warriors of the world
Many stand against us, but they will never win
We said we would return and here we are again
To bring them all destruction, suffering and pain
We are the hammer of the gods, we are thunder, wind and rain.
There they wait in fear with swords in feeble hands
With dreams to be a king, first one should be a man
I call about and charge them all with a life that is a lie
And in their final hour they shall confess before they die
If I should fall in battle, my brothers who fight by my side
Gather my horse and weapons, tell my family how I died
Until then I will be strong, I will fight for all that is real
All who stand in my way will die by steel
Brothers everywhere - raise your hands into the air
We're warriors, warriors of the world
Hand Of Doom
Hands of doom are reaching out to crush all infidels who stray
Time to know the pain, no time to run within
And these hands you see before you will end the light of day
Your ashes will be cast into the wind
Your blood's upon the soil, your body fed to wolves
Not one of you will be left alive
Hear the sound pounding and the army of the night
By the hammer of Thor you now shall die
Tonight we strike, there is thunder in the sky
Together we'll fight, some of us will die
But they'll always remember that we made a stand
And many will die by my hand
High atop the mountain, with hammers in the wind
Lusting for blood and death again
In a flash of lightning strike now the house of death invites you
Body and soul to come within
I see the fear you have inside, you can run but never hide
I will hunt you down and tear you limb from limb
Nothing shall remain, not your memory, your name
It will be as though you never, ever lived
House Of Death
Blood and thunder mix with rain
Into the kingdom of darkness again
Lightning flash and body in flame
All shall kneel at the sound of my name
My path is set, I live with no regret
I'm sworn to kill, never to forget
No road back, I never will return
Into the fire of hell I will burn
And die, die, die into the house of death
And die, die, die into the fire of hell
Army of the heavens, my army waits in hell
To battle on the earth, for all the souls who fell
I will not go onto my death alone
Seven gates to pass until I reach my home
Across the bridge of death, beyond the gates of light
Into the heart of darkness, into the black of night
Into the darkness I command my soul
Never shall I repent, never shall I be saved
I go into the house of death
Before my last breath my enemies all shall die
Die, die, die into the house of death
Die, die, die into the fire of hell
Fight Until We Die
When they come, I'll be ready
I hear their voices inside
The stars in the heavens are moving
Soon they will align
Thor, god of thunder
Let me die with a sword in my hand
Raise your hands, swords in the wind
Brothers of metal together again
With blood in our voices we ride
We'll fight till we win or we'll fight until we die
Gods of thunder, fire and rain
Cut into the earth till none shall remain
Sons of demons I command you to fly
Ride on from hell into the sky
We'll fight until we die
Blood Of My Enemies
Three sons have I, and they
Ride by my side. - The fierce,
The black, and the wicked are
their names - we ride down my
enemies on their half-hearted flight.
No voice of mercy - no evangels of light.
Mighty messengers - heathens rage
Witness our coming - gods of the dead.
I ride through the air -
I laugh as I die - with powers of evil
Dark knowledge is mine.
The ride of the wicked.
The 1st sin was trust. -
Kill without warning - for blood now
I lust.
Strong winds - magic mist
To Asgard the Valkries fly
High overhead - they carry the dead
Where the blood of my enemy lies.
Three sons have I, and they
Ride by my side. - The fierce,

Hail And Kill
Brothers I am calling from the valley of the kings
with nothing to atone
A dark march lies ahead, together we will ride like
thunder from the sky
May your sword stay wet like a young girl in her
prime
Hold your hammers high
Blood and death are waiting like a raven in the sky
I was born to die
Hear me while I live
As I look into your eyes
None shall hear a lie
Power and dominion are taken by the will
By divine right hail and kill
Hail, Hail, Hail and Kill, Hail and Kill
Hail, Hail, Hail and Kill, Hail and Kill
My father was a wolf
I'm a kinsman of the slain
Sworn to rise again
I will bring salvation, punishment and pain
The hammer of hate is our faith
Power and dominion are taken by the will
By divine right hail and kill
Hail, Hail, Hail and Kill, Hail and Kill
Hail, Hail, Hail and Kill, Hail and Kill
Rip their flesh
Burn their hearts
Stab them in the eyes
Rape their women as they cry
Kill their servants
Burn their homes
Till there's no blood left to spill
Hail and Kill
Power and dominion are taken by the will
By divine right hail and kill
Hail, Hail, Hail and Kill, Hail and Kill
Thor
Black clouds on the horizon
Great thunder and burning rain
His chariot pounding,
I heard the heavens scream his name
I watched as he shouted
To the giants that died that day
He hehd up his hammer high
And called to Odin for a sign
Thor the mighty, Thor the brave
Crush the infidels in your way
By your hammer let none be saved
Live to die on that final day
Gods, Monsters and Men
We'll die together in the end
God of thunder, god of rain
Earth shaker who feels no pain
The powerhead of the Universe
Now send your never ending curse
Swing your hammer to crack the sky
Lift your cape so that you might fly
Back to Odin and the Gods on High
And leave this mortal world

Black Wind, Fire And Steel
Full moon light is calling me
My kigndom lies within
The mystic soul and lions heart
Brought by the talisman
The ecstasy of battle takes me
Where the falcons fly
Immortal youth was granted me
I will never die
Born of Black wind fire and steel
Born of Black wind fire and steel
Born to teach them all to heel
Born of Black wind fire and steel
Pounded by the hammers
Of the giants of the world
I can see in darkness
I'm the overlord
Single combat I await
My shadow brings them fear
The spikes upon my chariot
Will grind them when they're near
Born of Black wind fire and steel
Born of Black wind fire and steel
Born to teach them all to heel
Born of Black wind fire and steel
I am an outcast on the path of no return
Punisher and swordsman
I was born to burn
Black Wind always follows
Where my black horse rides
Fire's in my soul
Steel is on my side
Born of Black wind fire and steel
Born of Black wind fire and steel
Born to teach them all to heel
Born of Black wind fire and steel
Battle Hymn
By moonlight we ride ten thousands side by side
With swords drawn held high our whips and armour shine
Hail to thee our infantry still brave beyond the grave
All sworn the eternal vow the time to strike is now
Gone are the days when freedom shone now blood and steel meet bone
In the light of the battle's way the sands of time will shake
How proud our soldiers stand with mace and chain in hand
Sound of charge into glory ride over the top of their vanguished pride
To the battle we ride we crossed a starlit sky
No space no time we'll catch the wind
Strange losses, men died we crossed a starlit sky
And still no space and time we'll catch the wind

Deep into the earth

That once were bodies
But Odin alone would choose the day
They would enter Valhalla
And in their hour of need
He sent forth unto them The Berserker Rage
Now gods and men
They rose up from the ground
Screaming like wild animals
Such is the gift of absolute power
No blade or weapon would harm them
They killed them and horses alike
And all who stood before them died that day
Hail Gods Of War!!!!!

Sleipnir
He is descended from giants. His father Loki,
God of fire, is the sworn blood brother to
Odin himself. He rides across land, sea and air
From the land of the living, to the land of
The dead. This eight legged steed crosses eight
Points of the compass, from eight directions
Into eight dimensions. He is bringer of the
Valiant dead from the battlefield to Valhalla!
Carry we who die in battle
Over land and sea
Across the rainbow bridge to Valhalla
Odin's waiting for me
He was born of giants
His icy coat is grey
At night he rides into the world of death
The living by day
One day on his back I shall ride
From the battlefield into the sky
Borne by Valkyries we valiant dead
Into the hall of heroes shall be led
Ride down from Asgard
To the battlefield
Bringer of the valiant dead
Who died but never yielded
Carry we who die in battle
Over land and sea
Across the rainbow bridge to Valhalla
Odin's waiting for me
Faster then the fastest horse alive
The living son of fire rides
From the halls of across the sky
To the world of gods and men
Eight legs and magic runes
Carved upon his teeth
Thunder and lightning
Sound beneath his feet
On his back the war god Odin rides
Sword and magic spear held high
Ride down from Asgard
To the battlefield
Bringer of the valiant dead
Who died but never yielded
Carry we who die in battle
Over land and sea
Across the rainbow bridge to Valhalla
Odin's waiting for me
Loki God Of Fire
The son of giants
Walks across the sky
To the gods a friend
Fathered beast and men
As a falcon he did fly
Far across the sky
To take back the hammer
Of Thor his friend
He lives between the worlds
The world of gods and men
He is the god of fire
Burning higher
God of fire
Into the sky
The father of a wolf
And the serpent of the sea
The ruler of hell
A giant is he
To Odin he's a brother
A brother who is sly
One who changes shape
Who walks across the sky
He lives between the worlds
The world of gods and men
He is the god of fire
Burning higher
God of fire
Into the sky
God of fire
Burning higher
God of fire
Into the sky
Brother to Thor
And Odin god of war
Loki god of fire
Reigns for evermore
The father of a wolf
And the serpent of the sea
The ruler of hell
A giant is he
To Odin he's a brother
A brother who is sly
One who changes shape
Who walks across the sky
God of fire
Burning higher
God of fire
Into the sky
Blood Brothers
When the world turns you away
A friend will not say no
There is strength that we all have
It's not the strength we show
And in your darkest hour
In your darkest nights
Whatever life will do
I am here for you
Think of me wherever you are
When it seems like you're reaching the end
Call on me, know in your heart
On one you can always depend
I am thy friend
Though we're far away
The stars above are the same
And when you feel alone
There's one who shares your pain
A true friend has no price
There is none to pay
I remember you stood by me
I'm with you all the way
Think of me wherever you are
When it seems like you're reaching the end
Call on me, know in your heart
One who will always defend
I am thy friend
Think of me wherever you are
When it seems like you're reaching the end
Call on me, know in your heart
On one you can always depend
I am thy friend
Think of me wherever you are
When it seems like you're reaching the end
Call on me, know in your heart
One who will always defend
I am thy friend
Overture To Odin
The Blood Of Odin
Upon his shoulders perch two ravens, Hugin and Munin.
They circle the earth by day seeing all, at night they report to him the world's tidings.
He wears a golden helmet and a golden ring, at his side sit two wolves.
His weapons a magic sword and a spear called Gungnir, they are carved with runes.
His eight legged horse Sleipnir carries him over land, sea and air, the bringer of the valiant dead, the einherjar, from the battlefield across the rainbow bridge to Valhalla.
For a single drink of the enchanted water he paid with one eye, he was granted supreme wisdom.
He is the god of poetry, sorcery, and death.
Wounded, pierced by a spear he hung upside down for nine days.
Fasting and agony he made of himself a sacrifice to himself.
Given no bread nor mead he looked down, and with a loud cry fell screaming from the world tree.
In a flash of insight the secret magic of the runes was revealed to him.
He took up the runes and mastered them, eighteen powerful charms for protection, success in battle, lovemaking, healing and the power to bring back the dead.
His sacred blood mixed with black wind and rain wept down from the world tree deep into the earth.
He commanded the earth to crack open and to spew forth the strongest of the strong!
On this day he did bestow unto the world the sons of Odin!

Hail Gods Of War]
Glory Majesty Unity
Deep into the heart of the battle they fought. Covered on
All sides as all converged on them, until the four could
No longer be seen. As time passed I feared them lost, then
Slowly the armies separated, many were dead. I saw the four
Each down on one knee, all stopped to watch and gaze
Upon them with a smile of victory before sending them into
The ground.
Then they rose together to make a final stand. With their
Last bit of strength they raised their arms into the air pointing
Blood stained weapons to the sky. They called upon the god
Of war and made ready to die. But Odin would not call
Them this day to Valhalla, instead he sent thunder and
Lightning to strike the ground, bestowing upon them the
One gift every warrior lives in hope of - the berserker rage!
Now filled with that strength, the power of a thousand
Men was given them. No longer mortal they were touched
By the gods. This time when they took up the attack, men fell
Not by tens, but by hundreds, by thousands. And when the
Smoke did clear, the four spoke the words and the masses
Answered the response of the warrior's prayer.
Gods of war I call you
My sword is by my side
I seek a life of honor
Free from all false pride
I will crack the whip
With a bold mighty hail
Cover me with death
If I should ever fail
Glory, majesty, unity
Hail! Hail! Hail!
Gods Of War
Down from the sky
Into the fight
Hearts full of rage
Full of thunder and glory
Swords in the wind
Crossing the sky
Lords of doom
Bring an end to their story
Father on bended knee
I ask thee
Raise thy hand
We the sons of Odin
Await thy command
Born under the sign
Of the hammer we stand
And here we all may die
Our blood on the ground
The battle horns sound
Let thy Valkyries fly
Down from the sky
Into the fight
Hearts full of rage
Full of thunder and glory
Swords in the wind
Crossing the sky
Lords of doom
Bring an end to their story
Today is the day
We die in the fight
None shall remain
To pass one more night
Now Valhalla's calling us
Immortal
We are gods of war
Immortal
We are gods of war
Odin here the fallen wait
To join thee by thy side
Let Valhalla's gates open wide
Born under the sign
Of the hammer they lived
And here they fought and died
Their blood on the ground
The battle horns sound
Let thy Valkyries fly
Down from the sky
Into the fight
Hearts full of rage
Full of thunder and glory
Swords in the wind
Crossing the sky
Lords of doom
Bring an end to their story
Today is the day
We die in the fight
None shall remain
To pass one more night
Now Valhalla's calling us
Immortal
We are gods of war
Immortal
We are gods of war
Down from the sky
Into the fight
Hearts full of rage
Full of thunder and glory
Swords in the wind
Crossing the sky
Lords of doom
Bring an end to their story
Army Of The Dead, Part II
Raise thy weapons on this day
Ye shall not die alone
Fight and die let Valkyries fly
For they shall take thee home
I promise thee that on this night
Ye shall be by my side
Asgard's halls await with heroes
Brothers that have died
For thee we wait at Asgard's gates
Come join us by our side
Valhalla waits so choose thy fate
For all of us must die!
Odin
In the hall of the slain
Valkyries and heroes attend me
Ravens and wolves at my side
Forever they did befriend me
I paid an eye for a drink of mead
And was given wisdom supreme
Granted to me the secrets
Of magic, of life and death
Ah.. Speared hung upside down
Nine days and nights no food nor mead
The will to be a sacrifice
Of myself unto myself
Wisdom and rhyme
Sorcery, death living inside me
Of life and death I am king
For both do I bring by sword and spear and ring
Raise thy weapons on this day
Ye shall not die alone
Fight and die let Valkyries fly
For they shall take thee home
I promise thee that on this night
Ye shall be by my side
Asgard's halls await with hero's
Brothers that have died
For thee we wait at Asgard's gates
Come join us by our side
Valhalla waits so choose thy fate
For all of us must die!
Hymn Of The Immortal Warriors
A hero was he
Touching all our lives
As if he lived and died
In a single moment
Great were his deeds
All his words were true
He lived and died
A man of honor
He paid with his life
For his life was the price
To pass the gates immortal
Thy journey begins
With sword in the wind
Stay thy hand rest thy command
For Odin's call was heard above them all
Thy name shall never die!
Long shall we remember
He who walked the road of danger
Master of revenge
Death's no stranger
Blood and death lived on his sword
The god of war his only lord
Into the depths of hell
Go all he fell
Take thy shield take thy sword
All thy weapons to the sky
Ye shall need them when Odin bid thee rise
For none but the brave
Shall rise up from the grave
To see the Valkyries fly
And so it was by the hand of Odin
Did the immortal warrior pass through
The gates of Valhalla and into legend.
Rise brother rise pass Valhalla's gates
Here great warriors await
Reborn from thy steel
All thy wounds be healed
From the earth to the sky
Now the son of Odin rise!
Take thy place among the kings
For thy soul shall never die!
Die For Metal
They can't stop us
Let 'em try
For heavy metal
We will die!
Quit my job this morning said forever
I would hold my head up high
Cause I need metal in my life
Just like an eagle needs to fly
So I walked outside into the street
From a hall I heard thunder and screams
I walked inside so I could hear
And the guy beside me gave me a beer
He had his fist up in the air
And called me brother said my friends
Are over there
They call themselves immortals
They're the truest of the true
And in that very moment
I was born again like you
They said hold your head up high
Raise your fist up in the air
Play metal louder than hell
Louder than hell
They can't stop us
Let 'em try
For heavy metal
We would die!
Brothers stand beside me, there's a battle on
Know my words are true
There's a battle for true metal
They're marching they're marching on
Me and you
Ten thousand strong are here tonight
With twenty thousand fists up in the air
The power of true metal's calling you
It's everywhere
Hold your head up high
Raise your fist up in the air
Play metal louder than hell
Louder than hell
They can't stop us
Let 'em try
For heavy metal
We would die!
The Lord Of Steel
In the nights
We take flights
Witness the sites
The power and glory of steel
I fought and died
Lived many lives before
I am immortal like my sword
I kneel to no one except the lord
And my lord is steel
If you see me you just passed your time
To the hills you can run but not hide
Blood and death are wherever i ride
Armed for battle the lord on my side
Stand and face the lord of steel
The lord of steel
In the eyes of the lord you have sinned
Let your punishment begin
Only by death you atone
You shall not die alone
For the glory of battle
I will fight until i die
Live one day as an eagle
Or a lifetime as a fly
Like a candle burning
The wheels of time are turning
The lord of steel commands you
To die by my hand
Stand and fight the lord of steel
Time to face the lord of steel

Born In A Grave
A gift of life born in a grave
Never to die
A soul that will never be saved
That will never see light
While the world is sleeping
We all fly
In the daylight silence keeping
We wait for the night
When the day ends life begins
When the shadows take light
For hundreds of years
We are your fears
We never will die
When the light goes away
We come out to play
Innocence lost and a demon within
Forgive me father, yes i have sinned
I will never be holy
I will never be saved
This was the gift on the day
I was born in a grave
Basking in the moonlight
Wolves will howl
And the bats will fly
You never knew
We were watching
Lifeless inside
For the blood is the life
The gift of the night
That has kept us alive
For thousands of years
We lived in your tears
And we never will die
When the light goes away
We come out to play
Innocence lost and a demon within
Forgive me father yes i have sinned
I will never be holy
I will never be saved
This was my gift on the day
I was born in a grave
Righteous Glory
She is watching
From on high
She knows who lives or dies
She will take me to the sky
Should darkness be my fate
Then let me fall among brave
In battle i shall die
In righteous glory i abide
In righteous glory she’ll come to me tonight
She will carry me across the other side
My brothers wait
Odin knows my name
In the hall of the slain
She takes me through the clouds
To another place and time
Holds me in her arms
Immortal and divine
On hooves of thunder
Her white horse parts the sky
Take me to valhalla
Valkyrie mine
Touch The Sky
Thunder touched my soul
I heard a call all should know
It’s my time i’m alive
Some will come some will go
But most will never know
That greatness lives inside
Like the night turns into day
Doesn’t matter what they say
My will is strong as a mountain’s high
I feel so tall i can touch the sky
Speak your mind, put me down
Say your prayers when i’m around
I live the life i’m not passing by
Shorn of hopes and dreams
I don’t buy their foolish schemes
I just walk on by
I was born with a hero’s soul
If you got one then you know
Reach my hand where the eagles fly
I feel so tall i can touch the sky

When you see my eyes
there's thunder in the sky
and soon your gonna die

Father
When I was small
You took me by the hand
Father you should know
I finally understand
You taught me wrong from right
And how to live
You gave the greatest gift
That one could give
You never let me down
You made me strong
When I made mistakes
When I was wrong
Some days we'd laugh
And some days we'd fight
Somehow you knew one day
I'd say you were right
You're with me
In every word I say
In every hour
Of every single day
In all I do
I'm just a part of you
You lived your life for us
That was your plan
Those hands that never take
They worked the land
Hands that never take
Can only give
And because of you
I know how to live
You're with me
In every word I say
In every hour
Of every single day
In all I do
I'm just a part of you
Father just one thing
You always knew
Every word you said to me was true

From a battle I've come
To a battle I ride
Blazing up to the sky

And I know Why
Cause of Lies
You will dieEmerald Sword
Crossed the valleys the dust of midlands
to search for the third key to open the gates
Now I'm near the altar the secret inside
as legend told my beloved sun light the dragons eyes
On the way to the glory I'll honour my sword
to serve right ideals and justice for all
Finally happened the sun lit their eyes
the spell was creating strange games of light
Thanks to hidden mirrors I found my lost way
over the stones I reached the place it was a secret cave
In a long bloody battle that prophecies told
the light will prevail hence wisdom is gold
For the king for the land for the mountains
For the green valleys where dragons fly
For the glory the power to win the black lord
I will search for the emerald sword
Only a warrior with a clear heart
could have the honour to be kissed by the sun
Yes, I'm that warrior I followed my way
led by the force of cosmic soul I can reach the sword
On the way th the glory I'll honour my sword
to serve right ideals and justice for all
For the king for the land for the mountains
For the green valleys where dragons fly
For the glory the power to win the black lord
I will search for the emerald sword
Wisdom Of The Kings
Removed the stones which hide the cave
blind and dark along my way
I must go on wise and brave before a last hail
At the end of floor stairs  of ancient stone
lead me to a vision, an unreal hall
And they appear in front of me
lightened by a mystic flame
A new dimension I have to face beyond the gates
I can not believe oh what now I see
when the two demons awake from the sleep
Holy dragons keepers of time
Ride brave the blue skies and spell my eyes
Fly beyond these hills ride on the wind
The wisdom of the kings
Lost in a dream I'm under the spell
of this sunny magic land
But Aresius said: Become aware! All can hide the hell...
Now it's time to go to the mighty sword
it's time to follow the kings holy call
Holy dragons keepers of time
Ride brave the blue skies and spell my eyes
Fly beyond these hills ride on the wind
The wisdom of the kings
Heroes Of The Lost Valley
"Yes, mighty warrior... What you hear now are the suffering, voices of all
the heroes that crossed these lands before you. They ended their quest tragically
but their thirst for victory is still alive and breathers through these
ancient rocks corroded by the fury of the wind. Their pride now rides with you..."
Eternal Glory
Echoes of terror in this old land
I see the result of their quest
Skulls of old heroes lie everywhere in this mystical place
Dust in their eyes, dust in my pride
in this infinite journey to the ancient sword
I can hear their lament between these rocks
the whisper on an angry ghost
he speaks for them all trapped on this lost world
I am their very last hope
to ride from hell free once again
to break the chains from a bloody past for my victory
Eternal glory ride fast to me
pound in my heart for the Algalord kings
Eternal glory spread your wide wings
fly and forever lead my holy steel
I'll fight I'll cry for your silence your name
You'll live through me I will end all your pain
for the swan in the lake the bird on the tree
the place for my beloved lands
The black king is near and Algalord calls
so heroes of the lost valley raise all your voice
Eternal glory ride fast to me
pound in my heart for the Algalord kings
Eternal glory spread your wide wings
fly and forever lead my holy steel
Beyond The Gates Of Infinity
Fire of wisdom light the sky
let me go no through this dark evil ground
A veil of fog now covers all
something is happening my heart must be strong
Keep away monsters of hell
No, I won't give you my inviting flesh
Deformed creatures all around me
crept out from ancient and unholy crypts
They'll be your madness they'll be your end
they'll lick your bones and they'll drink your brain
Keep away monsters of hell
No, I won't give you my inviting flesh
Your tongue will be torn your bowels my food
your body impaled of shit will be full
now foolish warrior hear my words
You are condemned and you will come
with us all beyond the gates of infinity
I'm the mighty warrior herd of the northern lands
Algalord is calling so your hell must wait
Your tongue will be torn your bowels my food
your body impaled of shit will be full
now foolish warrior hear my words
You are condemned and you will come
with us all beyond the gates of infinity
Wings Of Destiny
Day has gone but I'm still here with you
my sweet rose my green hills
beloved sea, lakes and sky
beloved mother earth
Silent land erase my thoughts
I wanna lose myself in you, all in you
caress me and my soul
while I close my eyes
On wings of destiny
through virgin skies
to far horisons I will fly
Dear peaceful land, dear mother earth
caress my soul while I close my eyes
On wings of destiny
through virgin skies
to far horisons I will fly
The Dark Tower Of Abyss
Spread your wings to dark horisons
fly where the twilight reigns
Mighty Tharos cross the line of hell
it's so near
Lost in the shadow I search for my sun
Fly and face it before the new moon
there where chaos rules
Domine deterges nubila caeld
Bellator a proposito non deterreres
Unholy vision ancestral terror
spare my mind my innocent eyes
"...And suddenly the the unreal silence is broken by a lament...
A lament coming up from the deepest Darkest abyss...
And from the seven gates of the dark fortress
the dead come back to life to face him... this is hell..."
Immortal fire now light my heart light my way
Face the old legend the guardian of space and time
Living dead on black winged demons
fly high to play with your head
Gothic portals mystic towers
between the dark clouds
Lost in the shadow I search for my sun
Fly and face it before the new moon
there where chaos rules
Riding The Winds Of Eternity
Wise and mighty you are force of the earth
Fierce becomes the sea at your command
Winds of the south winds of the north
let me hear your call
Blow on my heart filling my soul
give me the force of the storm
For all of the  time I will ride be my guide
I will follow your sign for a just life
Winds of the  south winds of the north
let me hear your call
Blow on my heart filling my soul
give me the force of the storm
Riding the holy winds, winds of eternity
I'll fight you forever nightmares sons
Symphony Of Enchanted Lands
"Oh, cruel, destiny... The tears soon covered the warrior's face and Tharos,
the beloved dragon, spread his wings for the last time, happy to have found
the freedom at least in death... Fly... fly high, mighty Tharos... Your name
will always be remembered by the people of the enchanted lands... and your
memory will march with us forever against the hordes of the black lord for
the salvation of the enchanted lands.
Goodbye, brother... goodbye...!!"
God of dawn, father of thunder
Lord of the wind now blowing on me
Thank you for all, for your holy sign
For mountains and hills, the forest, the sea
for all those dead and for my princess
they'll shed their blood cause finally
the emerald sword is now mine
For what you did to them

Son of hell betrayer of light
king of the dark your name is carved on my steel
for your will the innocent die every day
but my sword will soon come for you all
and your kingdom will fall
and you'll be dust again forever
Rex tremende semper inimice
ad gloriam perpetuam brave all we'll march
to give you the eternal agony
Love magic word fill all my dreams eternally use me
Love guide me to ecstasy to victory to infinity
to rhymes of winds to the voice of the dead
to innocence of my memory
Rape of earth I want your head
sadist pig I can't forgive what you did

But my sword will soon come for you all
and your kingdom will fall
and you'll be dust again forever

to give you the eternal agony
"Go, mighty warrior... The kings of enchanted lands are awaiting your
victory! Ride on the wings of wisdom, ride beyond the middle valleys to
defeat the master of chaos in the name of cosmic justice. Peace and love
forever!"
"At the court of king Chaos only blood
can write its own tragedy..."
Mighty warriors from the silver hills
march, all led by golden winds
Elves and trolls from holy mystic woods
run through the last snow
He's now coming from the middle lands
handling proud his magic sword
Glory, pride and honor ride with him
Burns the flame of north
They will all meet in the Kazar ruins
not so far from Ancelot
In the temple of the fallen one
their hope will be born...
Born from the ashes of ancient glory... Born!
They all hail the mighty chosen one
reaching the skies with their cry
They are ready to reach Ancelot
Arwald's calling loud...
"Glory ride with us!  Lux Triumphans!
Magic and steelgods lead us to a new dawn..."
Dawn Of Victory
Fire is raging on the battlefield
while Arwald is fighting the war of the kings
The army of Dargor, the thunder, the storm...
so people are calling the brave and his sword
No time left to save the wise throne!
Shades of a past not so far to forget...
the rise of the demons from their bloody hell!
So come mighty warrior to light the lost hope
for Tharos the dragon and your cosmic soul...
Now handle your emerald sword!
For Ancelot
the ancient cross of war
for the holy town of gods
Gloria, gloria perpetua
in this dawn of victory
The ride of the dead and their practice of pain
is pounding in him as a terrific quake
You're closer and closer now follow their smell
with your holy armour the steel in your hand
Fly angel of bloody revenge!
For Ancelot
the ancient cross of war
for the holy town of gods
Gloria, gloria perpetua
in this dawn of victory
Tragic and furious the clash of the steel of the gods
and so magic the power, the sword in his valorous hands
Oceans of fire are blasting the throne of the demons
and from distant red skies the thunders are calling his name
the name of the master of pain!
For Ancelot
the ancient cross of war
for the holy town of gods
Gloria, gloria perpetua
in this dawn of victory
Triumph For My Magic Steel
Flies to where old dragons are lying
the cry for the triumph for my magic sword
Burns the pride of my mighty conscience
while rises the sceptre of our wise lord
So thunder and storm, the rage of the sword
the fury of my war
The axe of the dwarf, the blood on the stone
the scream for the eternal
Rage in the wind at the triumph for my magic steel
you will taste the blade of the ancient sword... and
Rage in the wind at the triumph for my magic steel
led by hundreds of mighty and fallen lords
Dead, laments and unholy sorrow
The heads of the fallen are staining the snow
May this be the last hated cruel war
I'm looking at my skies but they answer not!
So thunder and storm, the rage of the sword
the fury of my war
The axe of the dwarf, the blood on the stone
the scream for the eternal
Rage in the wind at the triumph for my magic steel
you will taste the blade of the ancient sword... and
Rage in the wind at the triumph for my magic steel
led by hundreds of mighty and proudly fallen brave lords
Old cathedrals dusty graves where nest the seeds of holy victory
Blood from old crypts gushing out to drown the deadly cosmic enemy
Steel all around for the king and his crown
Winds of the dawn are caressing us all...
Ancelot smiles at the knights' epic cry
Thanks to the old and their emerald sword
The kingdom is now hailing the triumph over Dargor
and he the man from Loregard he stands in front of all... of all!
The Village Of Dwarves
The dwarves of Lork are showing all their honour
when you walk on the Gandor secret hill
The dance for fire and wind
and the stories about old kings
are pleasing our brave lords
down in the village of dwarves
The elves are playing under timeless willows
while blue and red paint all my beloved land
The dance for fire and wind
and the stories about old kings
are pleasing our brave lords
down in the village of dwarves
The eagle's eye is hiding something tragic
but in this night the red wine rules in me
The dance for fire and wind
and the stories about old kings
are pleasing our brave lords
down in the village of dwarves
And all night long me Arwald and Aresius
we speak, we laugh, we honor our king
The dance for fire and wind
and the stories about old kings
are pleasing our brave lords
down in the village of dwarves
And time has come now to ride
before the end of the night
the march of the swordmaster
to the unholy fight
Dargor, Shadowlord Of The Black Mountain
Mighty and brave is the fighter of shade
He's prince of the darklands... Dargor his name
Adopted by Vankar, old wizard of Helm
disciple of evil he twisted his brain
Fire burns between pride and honour
Steel wild pounds in his dragonheart
Face to face with the cult of evil
Prince of lands of the darkest dream
We sing to the wind the legend of the kings
to spread our heart to the kingdom of dust
where heroes are lost, where's reigning the shadowlord
Power and glory but for the wrong side
For his tragic past he disowned the sunlight
But Akron knows well all the truth of that day
He needs him as fighter, a warrior so brave
Fire burns between pride and honour
Steel wild pounds in his dragonheart
Face to face with the cult of evil
Prince of lands of the darkest dream
We sing to the wind the legend of the kings
to spread our heart to the kingdom of dust
where heroes are lost, where's reigning the shadowlord
The Bloody Rage Of The Titans
Between my trees the unicorn runs
from the highest mountains the water falls
Flowers and plants now caress my eyes
along these holy valleys kissed by light
And I am victim of this spell
wonderful symphony of enchanted lands...
The whisper of spring is now carried by winds
the winds from the land of the fire
Where peace is a gift from the king of the kings
It seems so strongly unreal... unreal!
Dragons and demons beware!
It's the rage of the titans...
Is the titans' bloody rage!
Warlords and steelgods beware!
It's the rage of the titans...
Is the titans' bloody rage!
The oak, my sister, smiles at the sun
now free from the weight of winter
The eagles fly from mountain to mountain
enchanting my heart... brave heart!
Dragons and demons beware!
It's the rage of the titans...
Is the titans' bloody rage!
Warlords and steelgods beware!
It's the rage of the titans...
Is the titans' bloody rage!
Holy Thunderforce
Face me evil bastard, smell the hate of angels
Glory, pride and bloodshed
Cowards and beholders, rapers of my wisdom
mix of dust and bones
Go back to your abyss, Algalord will not fall
but your heads will soon roll
Test the blade of heroes, fury of the thunder
hit my golden shield
So we'll fight against the wind for the glory of the kings
to defeat the evil enemies
And we'll ride with our lord for the power and the throne
in the name of holy thunderforce
Arwald and Aresius with the nordic warrior
on their way to Hargor
Chaos and oblivion, turmoil and disorder
will have now their name
The last fallen heroes will defeat your forces
Thousand spirits calling
On the furthest mountain I will see your fire
quenched by holy frost!
So we'll fight against the wind for the glory of the kings
to defeat the evil enemies
And we'll ride with our lord for the power and the throne
in the name of holy thunderforce
Trolls In The Dark
The Last Winged Unicorn
The seven red flames of the cave
are lightning the horrible torture
constricted to see he regrets
to have had the life from his god
Airin sheds black tears supporting the terrible rape
the fury of the sons of the thunder
is breaking the mystical chain
Arwald falls so to his knees
while Akron the black king is laughing
the princess falls down on the stones
with no breath of life anymore
May your ambition lead you to the unholy name
So my soul will fight you forever
in one of the many new hells
From the holy sea of golden flames
flies the last winged unicorn
With its magic breath of innocence
rising to the crystal throne
Skies are spitting holy fire wisdom cries and deadly whispers flow
Flow down to silent mystic shores
Shores of spirits thirst for vengeance waiting for their holy crystal gate
Gate to the sunny holy lands
"Lands of a timeless world...
an enchanted timeless world like no other...
there where magic flowers paint the cosmic landscape
and noone knows the word... pain!"
Tears of blood and sadness formed the wonderful silent lake
Swans and birds in water games will call Airin's name... her name!
And now is the time to decide
on a way to escape from the cavern
the old silver chains on the wall
are now also trapping their souls
Airin my princess I can not endure all my pain
but I swear to you on my proud name...
you'll open the mystical gate!
From the holy sea of golden flames
flies the last winged unicorn
With its magic breath of innocence
rising to the crystal throne
The Mighty Ride Of The Firelord
Cruel Akron bloody bastard I now spit on you
You can turn my bones to black ash but I'll move the moon
I will light your evil kingdom
and your heart will burn in flames
Mutilated or dismembered
we'll soon rise to eat your brain
You will pay for your victims and for Airin's bloody rape
For Arwald my dear friend and all my crying wasted land
I call the rage of my dead
I call the black angels' tears
Also Dargor can't endure all... goes out from the cave
while the demons take the hero for their tragic game
Gods of earth save me from madness
from these rites of total shame
while descending in the red flame
Arwald dies but not in vain
They will pay for this nightmare, for the symphony of pain
For Airin, my dead friend and all my crying wasted land
I call the Tharos' fire
I call the thunder roar
Raise your voice and ride all
ride all brave, raise your sword to the sky
and sing the epic symphony
for the mighty and proud firelord
Arwald's acid broke the silver chains
before his very last breath
Akron laughing really doesn't know what now waits for him...
Gods are raging leading my red steel
heads and limbs are falling down
It's in me the mystic messenger bringer of revenge
"Black angel, I call you! King Chaos is raging
in the torment of my heart...
I call the holy earthquake to end this bloody hell!"
Gods are raging leading my red steel
heads and limbs are falling down
It's in me the mystic messenger bringer of revenge
while she comes, beloved sunlight
On the river known as Aigor
our hero found his way
All the demons desperately
search for him now but in vain
They will pay for this nightmare, for the symphony of pain
For Airin, my dead friend and all my crying wasted land
I call the Tharos' fire
I call the thunder roar
Raise your voice and ride all
ride all brave, raise your sword to the sky
and sing the epic symphony
for the mighty and proud firelord
Knightrider Of Doom
The fading illusion the sirens' grey tears
it's here in the cold air the town's tragic fear
The breath of infernos the rise of the dead
the portals of chaos the seventh black flame
IN THIS BLOODY DAWN
I WILL WASH MY SOUL
TO CALL THE SPIRIT OF VENGEANCE
TO DENY MY WISDOM FOR ANGER
TO BREAK THE SCREAM OF THE SILENT FOOL
AND TO BE THE SON OF DOOM...
OF DOOM!
IN THIS BLOOD DAWN
I WILL WASH MY SOUL
TO CALL THE SPIRIT OF VENGEANCE
TO DENY MY WISDOM FOR ANGER
TO BREAK THE SCREAM OF THE SILENT FOOL
TO BE A KNIGHTRIDER OF DOOM...
OF DOOM!
The rites of the unborn the dragonship's fall
the waves of my ocean the twins' holy call
The march of the heroes the call of the gods
after the rituals on the silent shore
IN THIS BLOODY DAWN
I WILL WASH MY SOUL
TO CALL THE SPIRIT OF VENGEANCE
TO DENY MY WISDOM FOR ANGER
TO BREAK THE SCREAM OF THE SILENT FOOL
AND TO BE THE SON OF DOOM...
OF DOOM!
IN THIS BLOODY DAWN
I WILL WASH MY SOUL
TO CALL THE SPIRIT OF VENGEANCE
TO DENY MY WISDOM FOR ANGER
TO BREAK THE SCREAM OF THE SILENT FOOL
TO BE A KNIGHTRIDER OF DOOM...
OF DOOM!
The Power Of The Dragonflame
Rise mighty dragon...
Rise, rise, rise, rise...
Mighty dragon rise!
Ruins of ancient wisdom closing now my darkest lonely eye
god is dead in Thorald and in Elnor's rhyme
Mutilated bodies are now carved in ancient holy stone
tragic decoration of unholy wars
The heart of the dragon is screaming awaiting
to write the black last page
The page of blood was written by them...
the dead now lying on the sand
Visions of disaster are now challenging the wild storms
cyclops of the midlands wash my bloody shore
Sirens from the open seas now heal my broken wounded brain
I call the holy typhoons... air, fire, earth!
The heart of the dragon is screaming awaiting
to write the black last page
The page of blood was written by them...
the dead now lying on the sand
FROM THE SILENT HILL WE SCREAM LOUD YOUR NAME
MIGHTY POWER OF THE DRAGONFLAME
FROM THE MOUNTAINS PROUD AND STRONG
WE CALL OUR DRAGONLORD
Mighty dragon rise... rise!
The heart of the dragon is screaming awaiting
to write the black last page
The page of blood was written by them...
the dead now lying on the sand
FROM THE SILENT HILL WE SCREAM LOUD YOUR NAME
MIGHTY POWER OF THE DRAGONFLAME
FROM THE MOUNTAINS PROUD AND STRONG
WE CALL OUR DRAGONLORD
The March Of The Swordmaster
Ride... die... sacrifice!
Along the river of bloody tears
the mighty steel shining in my hands
we march and honor our brothers
victims of Kron's evil plan
We cross the lakes of the holy woods
to reach the ocean where red waves rule
the black king is moving to Algalord
this is the time... he has to be stopped!
HAIL, HAIL!
...Brave Swordmaster!
MARCH, MARCH!
...Great Swordmaster!
and I ask the wind for the fall of the king...!
INTO THE RAY OF THE SUN
MARCH OUR HERO HUNTING THE DARKLORD
REBORN FROM THE BLOOD OF HIS GOD...
HIS GOD... THE WARMASTER KRON
RIDE FOR THE FALL OF HIS POWER
FIGHTING THE STORM, THE ROAR OF THE THUNDER
ALLY OF THE SUN AND THE MOON...
GREAT SWORDMASTER RULE!
Between the waves of the raging sea
echoes of warcries and battle hymns
the underworld's armies found their ancient queen
the funeral march in the depths of the abyss
The terror which strikes the honor which prays
will be face to face in the mortal doomsday
Resist my fierce soldiers their vision can kill
it will test your courage... and your will to live
HAIL, HAIL!
...Brave Swordmaster!
MARCH, MARCH!
...Great Swordmaster!
and I ask the wind for the fall of the king...!
INTO THE RAY OF THE SUN
MARCH OUR HERO HUNTING THE DARKLORD
REBORN FROM THE BLOOD OF HIS GOD...
HIS GOD... THE WARMASTER KRON
RIDE FOR THE FALL OF HIS POWER
FIGHTING THE STORM, THE ROAR OF THE THUNDER
ALLY OF THE SUN AND THE MOON...
GREAT SWORDMASTER RULE!
To avenge all those cries I will rise to the sky
to defend mother life...
Ride... die... sacrifice!
When Demons Awake
Oh god don't forsake me, I need to survive
the unholy vision, the eternal bloody night
He pronounced the rites, the slimy queen's awake
the cause is the sword, my sword in Akron's hands
The vomit of evil, the venom of death
is crashing my wisdom, is blocking my legs
They all suck the blood, have ecstasy in pain
eating their flesh, devouring their brains
Dead and vampires spit out from hell...
is the new legion of the lord of the damned
The vengeance of the gods, soon their heads will roll
Oh, bringer of chaos... you will pay for all!
Bowels' rain around me, brothers mutilated
oh disfigured faces, flying army and bones
Fuck you bloody bastard, demon's raped soul
die into oblivion with your shitty sons
I'M THE NORDIC WARRIOR
HUNTER OF THE MARCHING DEAD
I'M THE BLOODY HAND OF TYTANS
WHEN... WHEN DEMONS AWAKE
Inferno apri rubami l'anima
voglio sfidare l'oscuro demone
Tutto e' in me, cielo e oceani
fratelli gargoyles, volate qui da me
Oh god don't forsake me, I need to survive
the unholy vision, the eternal bloody night
He pronounced the rites, the slimy queen's awake
the cause is the sword, my sword in Akron's hands
The vomit of evil, the venom of death
is crashing my wisdom, is blocking my legs
They all suck the blood, have ecstasy in pain
eating their flesh, devouring their brains
I'M THE NORDIC WARRIOR
HUNTER OF THE MARCHING DEAD
I'M THE BLOODY HAND OF TYTANS
WHEN... WHEN DEMONS AWAKE
Agony Is My Name
One for the pain and two for my name
three for my wonderful kingdom
Four for my king, five for my queen
Six for the fall of my wisdom...
Earth's calling me!
Airin, Arwald, Tharos in my painful dreams
Horror and death crossing my way
paint all the unreal landscape
Villages burn, the black fire runs...
runs through the heart of the forest...
killing my trees!
ALGALORD'S CALLING FOR HOLY REVENGE
THE RAGE OF THE HEROES IN MY HANDS
THE FURY WILL RISE AND SOON
THEY WILL TASTE MY SILVER BLADE
AND THEY WILL FACE THE PROPHECY
'CAUSE AGONY IS... MY NAME!
Black is the rose that's now in my hand
black for the blood of the fallen
symbol of death will soon be reborn
into the life of my tears' fall...
reborn and grow!
Silent cries of children in my painful dreams
ALGALORD'S CALLING FOR HOLY REVENGE
THE RAGE OF THE HEROES IN MY HANDS
THE FURY WILL RISE AND SOON
THEY WILL TASTE MY SILVER BLADE
AND THEY WILL FACE THE PROPHECY
'CAUSE AGONY IS... MY NAME!
ALGALORD'S CALLING FOR HOLY REVENGE
THE RAGE OF THE HEROES IN MY HANDS
THE FURY WILL RISE AND SOON
THEY WILL TASTE MY SILVER BLADE
AND THEY WILL FACE THE PROPHECY
'CAUSE AGONY IS... MY NAME!
Languishes in me the broken echo
at the grim look of the blind angel
ruins in me the ancient rhyme
in the heart of the wounded, dying swan
Worlds of betrayed eternity
Of vanished truth, that are now shedding
Tears of farewell into a black void
Proud and sincere, I'll go (to meet) my destiny
The thunder cries
my heroic lament,
fate ... consume reality.
Spirits of arcane worlds
I ask for life beyond death
To align the friendly stars
And to become a celestial guardian
Keeper of healed eternity
Of truth found for all children of mother earth
Always to her I have always given (my) life. (my) death.
thus I will continue.
The thunder cries
my heroic lament,
fate ... consume reality.
Steelgods Of The Last Apocalypse
Soon... winter again...
...snowlord come...
Come and cover those grey walls...
...VIOLENCE CALLS!
I want his fall...
his epic fall... in this evil war...
...fought to protect our ancient throne
From this grey prison I look at you
my lost and beloved wasted holy town
I call the prophecy's miracle
the thunder of the ancient book's word
WE ARE...
WE ARE THE ONES...
WHO'LL FACE THE STEELGODS
OF THIS LAST APOCALYPSE...
...OF THE LAST APOCALYPSE!
Now... Algalord lies...
in the shades...
of my shy mystic rainbow...
...VIOLENCE CALLS!
I want his fall...
his epic fall... in this evil war...
...trapped behind these humid walls
Raise all your eyes to the autumn skies
capture the energy of that sight
They can have fun with my limbs and bones
but I swear my spirit will never fall
WE ARE...
WE ARE THE ONES...
WHO'LL FACE THE STEELGODS
OF THIS LAST APOCALYPSE...
...OF THE LAST APOCALYPSE!
The Pride Of The Tyrant
Back into the fire I will have my sword
He won one fight but not the total war
Hurricanes will wipe out the dynasty of Kron
The chains of steel can't hold the holy storm
Sunshine is lighting the ruins of the ancient town
the seven towers are screaming their pain so loud
With my eagles I'll fly free
from snowy mountains to crystal seas
WE WILL FLY TO THE EMPIRE OF STEELGODS
TO DISCOVER THE SECRET OF STORMS
AND AGAINST THE BLACK PRIDE OF THE TYRANT
WE'LL USE IT TO DEFEND OUR THRONE
Dargor don't believe him... listen to my words!
You are the one who can still save your soul
Akron is the bastard... he massacred all
The evil hand that serves the will of Kron
You hate the tyrant as I and now don't deny
Give me the power to show you that I am right
With my eagles I'll fly free
from snowy mountains to crystal seas
WE WILL FLY TO THE EMPIRE OF STEELGODS
TO DISCOVER THE SECRET OF STORMS
AND AGAINST THE BLACK PRIDE OF THE TYRANT
WE'LL USE IT TO DEFEND OUR THRONE
Seven flames to not forget, to be sure I'll not regret... ever!
...to become the rage of god... Chaos bringer worse than Kron...
beware!
Back into the fire I will have my sword
He won one fight but not the total war
Dargor don't believe him... listen to my words!
You are the one who can still save your soul
You hate the tyrant as I and now don't deny
Give me the power to show you that I am right
With my eagles I'll fly free
from snowy mountains to crystal seas
WE WILL FLY TO THE EMPIRE OF STEELGODS
TO DISCOVER THE SECRET OF STORMS
AND AGAINST THE BLACK PRIDE OF THE TYRANT
WE'LL USE IT TO DEFEND OUR THRONE
Rise From The Sea Of Flames
Mirror of tragic reflections
I'll break your glass showing pain
pain for the infernal vision
pain for that red bloody rain
Trapped in this lonely oblivion
dishonoured by acts not to name
I search for answers forgotten
trying not to become insane
Baptized in fire is the dark knight who rides in me
against the raging wind
RISE FROM THE WIDE SEA OF FLAMES
TO THE VALLEYS OF ETERNITY
RISE FROM THE WIDE SEA OF FLAMES
TO LEAD ME AGAINST THE ENEMY
FOR THE RUIN OF THE KING
Hope of dark stone are now falling
under attack of the ghouls
crashing the high dragons' tower
witness of legend untold
My brothers run through the grey streets
not spared by the queen's deadly call
some throw themselves from the high walls
denying the torture of soul
Baptized in fire is the dark knight who rides in me
against the raging wind
RISE FROM THE WIDE SEA OF FLAMES
TO THE VALLEYS OF ETERNITY
RISE FROM THE WIDE SEA OF FLAMES
TO LEAD ME AGAINST THE ENEMY
FOR THE RUIN OF THE KING
Gargoyles, Angels Of Darkness
The prophet told of loud thunders quaking the surface of earth
when the black raven would have turned victim of wonderful spells
He would have become a white swan born from the darklands of sin
Neither would Aresius have believed what was now changing in him
Swan... prince of the magic lake... Dargor's your name...
GARGOYLES, FLY
GARGOYLES, RISE
GARGOYLES, FLY HIGH...!
ANGELI DI PIETRA MISTICA
Another mess of vampires, masquerade of sadistic pride
He could not endure these cruel games
against him who once spared its life
He realized so not too late to be really far from his king
far from his infinite blood thirst, too far to call them right for him
Rise... fly high and steal his soul... angels of stone...
GARGOYLES, FLY
GARGOYLES, RISE
GARGOYLES, FLY HIGH...!
Gargoyles, oh my brother gargoyles
Rise now, rise for his soul
Dargor, do it... it must be done...
free your rage and light your soul...
It's Gaia's call...
...the powerful energies of the furthest secret cosmos heard
so the prayer of our mother Gaia, the supreme spirit
who gave us the miracle of life... and her dark son breathed new life...
The power of the dragonflame was realizing what had seemed to be impossible...
And this is then the epic end
of the legendary tale
of the one who found the light
and the dragonflame inside
of the tragic rain of a thousand flames
of the town's defenders who faced pain
of symphonies of enchanted lands
of whispers of love and hate
The dawn of victory can breathe in the wind
and this would mean the great rebirth
reborn, the one who's giving his life
...the towns lying on the ground
Be one (Be one!) of us (of us!) and
act as all the prophecies want...
To mountains and valleys, to fire and snow,
to sun, moon and wisdom rise your soul...
it's the call...!
Oh no, oh god, oh god no
What is happening?
Oh, god, my god...
it happened... it happened!
Dargor mortally struck the queen of the dead and called the mighty gargoyles against the legions of darkness...
He pushed Akron into the hands of the nordic warrior, now a dying victim of terrible tortures... the chosen one let himself fall into the deep marshes constraining the black king, with the emerald sword again in his hands, not to move... they became food for the snakes of the abyss...
But this sacrifice had a terrific and great effect and Akron's death meant the victory on the evil forces of abyss... once... forever...
Remember, proud brothers... everything is possible... when you let the mystic power of the dragonflame burn in your heart... believe it... ...it's the dragonflame!
May there be misery for you, king of darkness
From the beginning to your holy end
Cruel fights and epic fury
Against disciples of darkness
For the eternal glory of the light
The everlasting furious rage
Against injustice and ruin
The eternal furious rage
May there be misery for you, king of darkness
Cruel king.

where peace is so rare
So hardy trees let me hear your words
about those memories
please tell me all about our hold
and epic battles they won
Beware of unholy fire

their flames can't burn the memory
the wisdom of the kings
The secrets of this forest

where freedom has its throne
where love must reign eternally

We must have all their valour
to defend these lands
or the sun in these valleys
will not shine again

I cry to see the innocent die
Brothers I'm ready the ride can begin

Now the time has come farewell my dear old friends
Ancelot is calling for my help
From the sun of Elgard to the middle plains
for salvation of enchanted lands
I'm looking forward to avenge all those killed

in the deadly raging flames of revenge
Virgin Skies
Land Of Immortals
Hear the silence of the winds making your own destiny
go and face the mirror of their sin
Only brave hearts found the way breaking all the dragon's spell
cross the Argon's glade with heart in hand
Land of immortals I wait for my day
to reach the wisdom of your skies
Land of immortals you must belong to me
from here to eternity
And between Elgard's hills near the ancient ruins of Kron
you will face the trick of the old dwarf
To obtain the second key you have to cross the bloody sea
where the thirst of Tharos never ends
Land of immortals I wait for my day
to reach the wisdom of your skies
Land of immortals you must belong to me
from here to eternity
Holy force of wisdom spread through all the air
I shall breathe you forever to end this epic holy quest
My way will be hard but I would do all
to reach the valleys where true heroes ride
beyond the ivory gates
Land of immortals I wait for my day
to reach the wisdom of your skies
Land of immortals you must belong to me

Echoes Of Tragedy
Where sun creates shadow's games
where tragic echoes speak of death why Lord why
between the ruins through lakes of holy blood
I walk in tears for my wasted land
Echoes of tragedy carved on my steel
in this neverending fight against the beast
soldiers of twilight turn back to hell
burn in your fire or glory for me will be your end
Mothers and children embraced in blood
torture and rape will leave their sign
after the sorrow I call the holy rage
burn in my heart now flames of blind hate
Echoes of tragedy carved on my steel
in this neverending fight against the beast
soldiers of twilight turn back to hell
burn in your fire or glory for me will be your end
Lord Of The Thunder
Born in the time of darkness and evil under the sign of God
glory's my mother fire's my brother sword my only law
Into the land of chaos and hate there is no place for me
and for the conquest of justice and honour I will use my steel
Holy flame burn again for eternity burn my heart to win
the holy war is awaiting another fiery king
Rage in my heart crossing the forest riding my black horse
across the valley along the river where the hot blood flows
Over the lakes and over the hills I follow the call of the wind
uphold the legend and for my princess I will fight and win
Holy flame burn again for eternity burn my heart to win
the holy war is awaiting another fiery king
Lord of the thunder please be my guide
before and after my last ride
I'll be your soldier serving the light
riding forever alive and proud
Holy flame burn again for eternity burn my heart to win
the holy war is awaiting another fiery king
Lord of the thunder please be my guide
before and after my last ride
I'll be your soldier serving the light
riding forever alive and proud
Legendary Tales
And darkness covers all the land
the silent river flows
the jesters dance around the flame
playing an ancient song
A song of mighty warriors
of epic bloody fights
while moonlight meets the manor's walls
and I must close my eyes
Another tale of infinite wars
for the defenders of holy light
the fire enters my mind
the blood of the innocent before my eyes
spreading the wings of the dream
I want to win between fire and steel
for them all
Some knights sleep near fire
drowned in their own red wine
the elder looks at the high flame
knowing the fight will reprise
The magic twittering of the birds
meets the light of dawn
the ancient song is fading now
but my old dream carries on
Another tale of infinite wars
for the defenders of holy light
the fire enters my mind
the blood of the innocent before my eyes
spreading the wings of the dream
I want to win between fire and steel
for them all

Emerald Sword
I crossed the valleys the dust of midlands
to search for the third key to open the gates
Now I'm near the altar the secret inside
as legend told my beloved sun light the dragon?s eyes
On the way to the glory I?ll honor my sword
to serve right and justice for all
Finally happened the sun lit their eyes
the spell was creating strange games of light
Thanks to hidden mirrors I found my lost way
over the stones I reached the place it was a secret cave
In a long bloody battle that prophecies told
the light will prevail hence wisdom is gold
For the king for the land for the mountains
for the green valleys where dragons fly
for the glory the power to win the black lord
I will search for the emerald sword
Only a warrior with a clear heart
could have the honor to be kissed by the sun
Yes, I?m that warrior I followed my way
led by the force of cosmic soul I can reach the sword
On the way to the glory I?ll honor my sword
to serve right ideals and justice for all
For the king for the land for the mountains
for the green valleys where dragons fly
for the glory the power to win the black lord
I will search
Where Dragons Flymm
The way is long, time is too short
this little footpath seems never to end
Green are the trees, musk on the stones
how it looks strange this mystical world
Sweet smelling rose what do you hide
behind your innocence red like my blood
Hungry for victory, hungry for love
love for the earth that made her son
strong and invincible serving my cry
go now and ride there where dragons fly 
The rocks appear in front of me
when the first shadows pretude to dark
Near is your end wild holy path
open my eyes to what the sun hides
Beloved mountain what do you hide
Where does your river flow, I want to know
Hungry for victory, hungry for love
love for the earth that made her son
strong and invincible serving my cry
go now and ride there where dragons fly
Land Of Immortals
Hear the silence of the winds making 
your own destiny go and face the 
mirror of their sin Only brave hearts 
found the way breaking all the 
dragon's spell cross the Argon's
glade with heart in hand
Land of immortals I wait for my day 
to reach the wisdom of your skies 
Land of immortals you must belong 
to me from here to eternity
And between Elgard's hills near the 
ancient ruins of Kron you will face 
the trick of the old dwarf To obtain 
the second key you have to cross them 
bloody sea where the thirst of Tharos 
never ends
Land of immortals I wait for my day 
to reach the wisdom of your skies 
Land of immortals you must belong
to me from here to eternity
Holy force of wisdom spread through
all the air I shall breathe you forever
to end this epic holy quest My way 
will be hard but I would do all to reach 
the valleys where true heroes ride 
beyond the ivory gates
Land of immortals I wait for my day to 
reach the wisdom of your skies Land 
of immortals you must belong to me 
from here to eternity
The Dark Secret
"It was a good time for all creatures of the earth, but fate decreed that the dark prophecy of a demon knight could bring a tragic end to this peace
scarring their lives forever. Shortly before his defeat in the last of the primordial wars between the heavens and hells the evil son of the Hell God Kron,
known as Nekron, withdrew to his lair in the underworld.
There, sensing his impending death he inscribed a testament of pure evil in seven black books. One by one six of these books were discovered through out
the ages, however the seventh, last and most terrible of all contained the secret of his resurrection.
He commanded seven immortal demons to carry out his dark plan.
But they were turned into stone by the angels of the crystal realms.
And so his dreams slept with them until a time came when the forces of evil would usurp the earth.
Nekron would rule in the unholy name! of cosmic chaos.
And this time he would reign supreme!"

"And so the Order of the White Dragon decreed Khaas the hero of the middle lands. He and princess Lothen from the kingdom of the ancient waterfalls,
together with Tharish, elven king of the caverns and myself, Iras Algor from Hor-Lad, would travel the path of incredible danger and great adventure.
Dargor the shadowlord would lead us through the ancient underworld of Dar-Kunor. Finally the time had come to find the legendary seventh black book, that
containing the worst of all the known prophecies"
The Last Angels' Call
After five long days the final plan
the wise words of Iras convinced all of them
The path to Erloria could be a safer way

Father...

You have betrayed me!!
 No!... I don't want to serve your hellish will...
You are half demon... never forget that!
You are one of us!
I know it well... for this I will pay!
But I will deny you and fight you forever!
Sacred power of raging winds fill their soul
and the shadowlord's heart
In a magical vision Vankar appeared in Dargor's dream
while the four heroes were trying to rest
He was born half demon half man...

Brave and proud at the last sun towards Erinor's mount,
The only way to reach there, where the air smells like death
Mud, marsh... remains of a reign that have been frightening us for millenniums

Shadows Of Death
The old elfking Tarish knows well the way
through the caverns
to Dar-Kunor's forgotten entrance
For two days they walked in the wild
on the pathway to darkness
the reason they survived it was Dargor
Finally they saw in the black and evil marsh
There lied the passageway between snakes and hellish mud

Follow behind into Dar-Kunor caves

FIVE HEROES READY TO DIE

into the black icy water

Then, when he appeared
they welcome him as heroes do.
he found the caves of the ancient brother elves

COLD MYSTIC NIGHT - IT FALLS ON THE PLAIN
ON THE GREY MOUNTAINS REIGNS NOW THE SHADE
ANGELS OF LIGHT GIVE THEM THE FAITH
TIME NOW HAS COME
DAR-KUNOR AWAITS
Unknown threat - it fills the dry air
the howling of wolves fades behind them
they try to find rest between the wild rocks
the one they'll soon see can be their last dawn
The angels' lament breaths in the cold winds
whispers of death surround the wide marsh
Dar-Kunor is there to swallow their souls
in front of them another hell's gate

Holy Thunderforce
Face me evil bastards, smell the hate of angels
Glory, pride and bloodshed
Cowards and beholders, rapers of my wisdom
Mix of dust and bones
Go back to your abyss, Algalord will not fall
But your heads will soon roll
Test the blade of heroes, fury of the thunder
Hit my golden shield
So we'll fight against the wind 
for the glory of the kings
to defeat the evil enemies
And we'll ride with our lord 
for the power and the throne
in the name of holy thunderforce
Arwald and Aresius with the nordic warrior
On their way to Hargor
Chaos and oblivion, turmoil and disorder
Will have now their name
The last fallen heroes will defeat your forces
Thousand spirits calling
On the furthest mountain I will see your fire
Quenched by holy frost
So we'll fight against the wind 
for the glory of the kings
to defeat the evil enemies
And we'll ride with our lord 
for the power and the throne
in the name of holy thunderforce
Dargor, Shadowlord Of The Black Mountain (Extended)
Not so far from the wide dragonland
Where the valleys breathe the smell of dark gate
Dargor is marching with the poor Airin
There where dark has ruled forever for the demonknights
Fire's rising to valleys of death
While shadows are rising from bloody hells
Fire's riding to Hargor, the town
Where evil and terror conquered the clouds
We sing to the wind the legend of the king
To spread out heart to the kingdom of dust
Where heroes are lost, where now reigns the shadowlord
Carved in shadow is his magic throne
Kron disciple, not extreme at all
Gothic his kingdom told by old jesters
Pride and terror live together in his stormy heart
Fire's rising to valleys of death
While shadows are rising from bloody hells
Fire's riding to Hargor, the town
Where evil and terror conquered the clouds
We sing to the wind the legend of the king
To spread out heart to the kingdom of dust
Where heroes are lost, where now reigns the shadowlord
Cry with me to fill the crystal sea
Cry for all the victims of these stones
Shed your tears to fill the silent fall
And wash in it your soul
Fire's rising to valleys of death
While shadows are rising from bloody hells
Fire's riding to Hargor, the town
Where evil and terror conquered the clouds
We sing to the wind the legend of the king
To spread out heart to the kingdom of dust
Where heroes are lost, where now reigns the shadowlord

Guardians
We're living in our units
And one thing we can do is
Work for a life without a fate
We don't pay any taxes
But the state is the axes
Of our minds without love without hate
We have a higher order
No one needs to be a hoarder
Our society is such a glorious thing
In our centers we can dream of
Anything you never think of
You can't say we are puppets on a string
Our minds are kept so clean
Checked up on a screen
They're holy men, they're saints
Without them we might all fail
We don't know war and crime
Things of ancient times
We just see it if we put on video
The blue pass is for my life
And the red one's for my wife
It's the only thing we really need to show
There are still some without rules
But I tell you, they're all fools
The Guardians will find them as we've seen
We got banks where we freeze them
They get new brains screwed in then
And act contrarily to what they have been
With new minds made so clean
Checked up on a screen
They will be the saints
Without them we might all fail
Guardians of our lives
Protect security
They turn the key and they step in
Controlling you and me
Guardians of our lives
Take care eternally
The Dark Secret
It was a good time for all creatures on the earth,
But fate decreed that the dark prophecy of a demon
Knight could bring a tragic end to this peace
Scarring their lives forever.
Shortly before his defeat in the last of the primordial
Wars between the heavens and hells the evil son
Of the Hell God Kron, known as Nekron, withdrew
To his lair in the underworld. There sensing his
Impending death he inscribed a testament of pure evil
In seven black books. One by one six of these books
Were discovered through the ages, however the
Seventh, last and most terrible of all contained the
Secret of his resurrection.
He commanded seven immortal demons to carry out
His dark plan. But they were turned into stone by
The angels of the crystal realms. And so his dreams
Slept with them until a time came when the forces of
Evilevul would usurp the earth. Nekron would rule in the
Unholy name of cosmic chaos.
And this time he would reign supreme!
Ira divina
A dolore nunc libera nos
Tacet rota temporis
Nunc est silentium
Sempiternus angelus
A malo libera nos
A malo
Unholy Warcry
The dark lies a secret he is sworn to return to avenge the lost divine wars.
Algalord arise greater than before
Time of peace not of war
Shouts of freedom from the castle walls
Freedom in the land and hope for all
Hope for all
Into the silent dark forgotten
Caves of dark-Kunor
Deep in the secret book is awaiting
Unholy warcry
Nekron promised bloody terror
Bringing death and pain
To the new world
From the rocky mountains
To the golden sea
To the Barbarians' sacred hills
From the icy north and misty lakes
To the walls of Seth and Elvish plains
All beware!
Into the silent dark forgotten
Caves of dark-Kunor
Deep in the secret book is awaiting
Unholy warcry
Nekron promised bloody terror
Bringing death and pain
To the new world
Torment pain and bloody rain
Nekron's resurrection
They must kill the demon king
Or fight another war
"Nekron would rule
In the unholy name of cosmic chaos
And this time he would reign supreme"
He is Kron Kron's disciple
He is sworn to return
To avenge the lost devine wars
There was only one who knew the way
He lived in the dark lonely caves
The demon of the night
Could save the day
Should they take a change or run away
Dargor was his name!
Into the silent dark forgotten
Caves of dark-Kunor
Deep in the secret book is awaiting
Unholy warcry
Now they swore to band together
On a sacred journey
Called by fate time to be great
Unholy warcry
Nekron promised bloody terror
Bringing death and pain
To the new world
Wisdom Of The Kings
Removed the stones which hide the cave
Blind and dark along my way
I must go on wise and brave before a last hail
At the end of floor stairs of ancient stone
Lead me to a vision, an unreal hall
And they appear in front of me
Lightened by a mystic flame
A new dimension I have to face beyond the gates
I can not believe on what now I see
When the two demons awake from the sleep
Holy dragons keepers of time
Ride brave the blue skies and spell my eyes
Fly beyond these hills ride on the wind
The wisdom of the kings
Lost in a dream I'm under the spell
Of the sunny magic land
But Aresius said: become aware! all can hide the hell...
Now it's time to go to the mighty sword
It's time to follow the kings holy call
Holy dragons keepers of time
Ride brave the blue skies and spell my eyes
Fly beyond these hills ride on the wind
The wisdom of the kings
The Village Of Dwarves
The dwarves of Lark are showing all their honour
When you walk on the Gandor secret hill
The dance for fire and wind
And the stories about old kings
Are pleasing our brave lords
Down in the village of dwarves
The elves are playing under timeless willows
While blue and red paint all my beloved land
The dance for fire and wind
And the stories about old kings
Are pleasing our brave lords
Down in the village of dwarves
The eagle's eye is hiding something tragic
But in this night the red wine rules in me
The dance for fire and wind
And the stories about old kings
Are pleasing our brave lords
Down in the village of dwarves
And all night long me Arwald and Aresius
We speak, we laugh, we honor our king
The dance for fire and wind
And the stories about old kings
Are pleasing our brave lords
Down in the village of dwarves
The eagle's eye is hiding something tragic
But in this night the red wine rules in me
The dance for fire and wind
And the stories about old kings
Are pleasing our brave lords
Down in the village of dwarves
And time has come now to ride
Before the end of the night
The march of the swordmaster
To the unholy fight
And time has come now to ride
Before the end of the night
The march of the swordmaster
To the unholy fight
Unholy fight
Unholy fight
Erian's Mystical Rhymes
In Primordial times of sorrow
Ancient ages of the known world
Kron's reign of terror was rising
So the skylords sent their angels
Against the storm that threatened heavens
Seven wars were so fought
The dead rose
Led by the darklords of hell
The last war
Meant the end
Of hellgod's
Old reign
Dark memories lost in the shades of illusion
Warn the light of electric sky
The angels could change the life on earth
But not the demons' old plans
United force of stron wise men...
A new order soon was born
Ten kings, ten wizards, elves and dragonlords
Ready to fight for their world
Ready to face the last secret
Hidden for 5angels' years
5years
A great and new hope in Elgard was born
The one hope that could finally find the
Sacred words to stop the dark plan of Nekron
All contained in Erian's mystical white book
The holy council cast their vote
Hearing the deep voice of soul
Etherus... Iras... two names on all
Elected to face the darklord
They knew so well Erian's tale
What could be found between his rhymes
His rhymes of divine light
Written to save our lands
Ready to face the last secret
Hidden for 5angels' years
5years
Now is the time for them to share all their plans
The one hope that could finally find the
Sacred words to stop the dark plan of Nekron
All contained in Erian's mystical white book
So the name was chosen
White Dragon's Order
All sworn to fight
All for one
One for all
A great and new hope in Elgard was born
The one hope that could finally find the
Sacred words to stop the dark plan of Nekron
All contained in Erian's mystical white book
Sacred words to stop the dark plan of Nekron
All contained in Erian's mystical white book
Dawn Of Victory
Fire is raging on the battlefield
While Arwald is fighting the war of the kings
The army of Dargor, the thunder, the storm...
So people are calling the brave and his sword
No time left to save the wise throne!
Shades of a past not so far to forget...
The rise of the demons from their bloody Hell!
So come mighty warrior to light the lost hope
For Tharos the dragon and your cosmic soul...
Now handle your emerald sword!
For Ancelot
The ancient cross of war
For the holy town of gods
Gloria, gloria perpetua
In this dawn of victory
The ride of the dead and their practice of pain
Is pounding in him as a terrific quake
You're closer and closer now follow their smell
With your holy armour the steel in your hand
Fly angel of bloody revenge!
For Ancelot
The ancient cross of war
For the holy town of gods
Gloria, gloria perpetua
In this dawn of victory
Tragic and furious the clash of the steel of the gods
And so magic the power, the sword in his valorous hands
Oceans of fire are blasting the throne of the demons
And from distant red skies the thunders are calling his name
The name of the master of pain!
For Ancelot
The ancient cross of war
For the holy town of gods
Gloria, gloria perpetua
In this dawn of victory
Gloria, gloria perpetua
In this dawn of victory
Nightfall On The Grey Mountains
Holy angels of eternal light
You who fell in the primordial age
Between these dark and grey lonely mountains
Who died to protect the green of the earth
For Algalord and Elgard, Thorald and Elnor
For all the towns of the known world
For the icy northlands, the waterfalls' kingdom
The dwarves' western realms and the whole middle lands
Cold mystic night - it falls on the plane
On the grey mountains reigns now the shade
Angels of light give them the faith
Time now has come
Dar-Kunor awaits
Unknown threat - it fills the dry air
The howling of wolves fades behind them
They try to find rest between the wild rocks
The one they'll soon see can be their last dawn
The angels' lament breaths in the cold winds
Whispers of death surround the wide marsh
Dar-Kunor is there to swallow their souls
In front of them another hell's gate
Cold mystic night - it falls on the plane
On the grey mountains reigns now the shade
Angels of light give them the faith
Time now has come
Dar-Kunor awaits
March Of The Swordmaster
Ride... die... sacrifice!
Along the river of bloody tears
The mighty steel shining in my hands
We march and honor our brothers
Victims of Kron's evil plan
We cross the lakes of the holy woods
To reach the ocean where red waves rule
The black king is moving to Algalord
This is the time... he has to be stopped!
Hail, Hail!
...Brave Swordmaster!
March, March!
...Great Swordmaster!
And I ask the wind for the fall of the king...!
Into the ray of the sun
March our hero hunting the darklord
Reborn from the blood of his God...
His God... the warmaster Kron
Ride for the fall of his power
Fighting the storm, the roar of the thunder
Ally of the sun and the moon...
Great swordmaster rule!
Between the waves of the raging sea
Echoes of warcries and battle hymns
The underworld's armies found their ancient queen
The funeral march in the depths of the abyss
The terror which strikes, the honor which prays
Will be face to face in the mortal doomsday
Resist my fierce soldiers their vision can kill
It will test your courage... and your will to live
Hail, Hail!
...Brave Swordmaster!
March, March!
...Great Swordmaster!
And I ask the wind for the fall of the king...!
Into the ray of the sun
March our hero hunting the darklord
Reborn from the blood of his God...
His God... the warmaster Kron
Ride for the fall of his power
Fighting the storm, the roar of the thunder
Ally of the sun and the moon...
Great swordmaster rule!
Into the ray of the sun
March our hero hunting the darklord
Reborn from the blood of his God...
His God... the warmaster Kron
Ride for the fall of his power
Fighting the storm, the roar of the thunder
Ally of the sun and the moon...
Great swordmaster rule!
Into the ray of the sun
March our hero hunting the darklord
Reborn from the blood of his God...
His God... the warmaster Kron
Ride for the fall of his power
Fighting the storm, the roar of the thunder
Ally of the sun and the moon...
Great swordmaster rule!
To avenge all those cries I will rise to the sky
To defend mother life...
Ride... die... sacrifice!
Emerald Sword
I crossed the valleys the dust of midlands
To search for the third key to open the gates
Now I'm near the altar the secret inside
As legend told my beloved sun light the dragons eyes
On the way to the glory I'll honour my sword
To serve right ideals and justice for all
Finally happened the sun lit their eyes
The spell was creating strange games of light
Thanks to hidden mirrors I found my lost way
Over the stones I reached the place it was a secret cave
In a long bloody battle that prophecies told
The light will prevail hence wisdom is gold
For the king for the land for the mountains
For the green valleys where dragons fly
For the glory the power to win the black lord
I will search for the emerald sword
Only a warrior with a clear heart
Could have the honour to be kissed by the sun
Yes, I'm that warrior I followed my way
Led by the force of cosmic soul I can reach the sword
On the way to the glory I'll honour my sword
To serve right ideals and justice for all
For the king for the land for the mountains
For the green valleys where dragons fly
For the glory the power to win the black lord
I will search for the emerald sword

Yes, my dear friends, the sun shining on our beloved

Elnor's Magic Valley
The Poem's Evil Page
The silent willows keep the ancient stone
hidden behind that cryptic door
Rituals of terror quake all the ghostland
the bloody line now paints the cold floor
The evil pages are almost written
with the dark poison of flesh and bones
Fire is raining on the grey mountains
Waters are waiting for the last oath
The way is open... now they are coming
called by the blasphemous words of the lord
...and finally the violet waves announce their arrival
and blood will soon be painting the beloved lamenting
ocean...
The way is open... now they are coming
called by the words... the words of the lord
Ethereal harmonies spread trough all the air...
the unreal calm before Elnor's end...
The Wizard's Last Rhymes
The aim of the serpent, the serpent's creation
reveals itself now trough crystal spheres
He's riding the waves as a real conqueror
colliding with ships, the ships of the kings
He owns... your sword!
The emerald weapon, the steel of the heroes
Flow the black tears of dark angels
Your blade is now serving the dark force...
the evil source of the unborn
the truth is there... in this hands

We are reaching the brutal, the tragic dimension
led by reflections, reflections of death
the ghost in the fog... wander lamenting

I reflect the constellations' fall
Now close your eyes and fight blind

were reaching the walls of the falling town...
Starless is my night, silent is my ride

Forest Of Unicorns
Run holy beloved horse
on this peaceful day
through these valleys kissed by light
where peace is so rare
So hardy trees let me hear your words
about those memories
please tell me all about our hold
and epic battles they won
Beware of unholy fire
my guardian of the trees
their flames can't burn the memory
the wisdom of the kings
The secret of this forest
the ride of unicorns
are treasures of these valleys
where freedom has its throne
where love must reign eternally
avoiding acts of war
We must have all their valour
to defend these lands
or the sun in these valleys
will not shine again
Beware of unholy fire
my guardian of the trees
their flames can't burn the memory
the wisdom of the kings
The secret of this forest
the ride of unicorns
are treasures of these valleys
where freedom has its throne
where love must reign eternally
avoiding acts of war
Land Of Immortals (Remix)
Hear the silence of the winds making your own destiny
go and face the mirror of their sin
Only brave hearts found the way breaking all the dragon's spell
cross the Argon's glade with heart in hand
Land of immortals I wait for my day
to reach the wisdom of your skies
Land of immortals you must belong to me
from here to eternity
And between Elgard's hills near the ancient ruins of Kron
you will face the trick of the old dwarf
To obtain the second key you have to cross the bloody sea
where the thirst of Tharos never ends
Land of immortals I wait for my day
to reach the wisdom of your skies
Land of immortals you must belong to me
from here to eternity
Holy force of wisdom spread through all the air
I shall breathe you forever to end this epic holy quest
My way will be hard but I would do all
to reach the valleys where true heroes ride beyond the ivory gates
Land of immortals I wait for my day
to reach the wisdom of your skies
Land of immortals you must belong to me
from here to eternity
Emerald Sword
I crossed the valleys the dust of midlands
to search for the third key to open the gates
Now I'm near the altar the secret inside
As legend told my beloved sun light the dragons eyes
On the way to the glory I'll honour my sword
to serve right ideals and justice for all
Finally happened the sun lit their eyes
the spell was creating strange games of light
Thanks to hidden mirrors I found my lost way
over the stones I reached the place it was a secret cave
In a long bloody battle that prophecies told
the light will prevail hence wisdom is gold
For the king for the land for the mountains
for the green valleys where dragons fly
for the glory the power to win the black lord
I will search for the emerald sword
Only a warrior with a clear heart
could have the honour to be kissed by the sun
Yes, I'm that warrior I followed my way
led by the force of cosmic soul I can reach the sword
On the way to the glory I'll honour my sword
to serve right ideals and justice for all
For the king for the land for the mountains
for the green valleys where dragons fly
for the glory the power to win the black lord
I will search for the emerald sword
Wisdom Of The Kings
Removed the stones which hide the cave
blind and dark along my way
I must go on wise and brave before a last hail
At the end of floor stairs of ancient stone
lead me to a vision, an unreal hall
And they appear in front of me
lightened by a mystic flame
A new dimension I have to face beyond the gates
I can not believe on what now I see
when the two demons awake from the sleep
Holy dragons keepers of time
ride brave the blue skies and spell my eyes
fly beyond these hills ride on the wind
the wisdom of the kings
Lost in a dream I'm under the spell
of the sunny magic land
But Aresius said: become aware! all can hide the hell...
Now it's time to go to the mighty sword

Dawn Of Victory
Fire is raging on the battlefield
while Arwald is fighting the war of the kings
The army of Dargor, the thunder, the storm...
so people are calling the brave and his sword
No time left to save the wise throne!
Shades of a past not so far to forget...
the rise of the demons from their bloody Hell!
So come mighty warrior to light the lost hope
for Tharos the dragon and your cosmic soul...
Now handle your emerald sword!
For Ancelot
the ancient cross of war
for the holy town of gods
Gloria, gloria perpetua
in this dawn of victory
The ride of the dead and their practice of pain
is pounding in him as a terrific quake
You're closer and closer now follow their smell
with your holy armour the steel in your hand
Fly angel of bloody revenge!
For Ancelot
the ancient cross of war
for the holy town of gods
Gloria, gloria perpetua
in this dawn of victory
Tragic and furious the clash of the steel of the gods
and so magic the power, the sword in his valorous hands
Oceans of fire are blasting the throne of the demons
and from distant red skies the thunders are calling his name
the name of the master of pain!
For Ancelot
the ancient cross of war
for the holy town of gods
Gloria, gloria perpetua
in this dawn of victory
Holy Thunderforce (Remix)
Face me evil bastards, smell the hate of angels
Glory, pride and bloodshed
Cowards and beholders, rapers of my wisdom
mix of dust and bones
Go back to your abyss, Algalord will not fall
but your heads will soon roll
Test the blade of heroes, fury of the thunder
hit my golden shield
So we'll fight against the wind for the glory of the kings
to defeat the evil enemies
And we'll ride with our lord for the power and the throne
in the name of holy thunderforce
Arwald and Aresius with the nordic warrior
on their way to Hargor
Chaos and oblivion, turmoil and disorder
will have now their name
The last fallen heroes will defeat your forces
Thousands spirits calling
On the furthest mountain I will see your fire
quenched by holy frost!
So we'll fight against the wind for the glory of the kings
to defeat the evil enemies
And we'll ride with our lord for the power and the throne
in the name of holy thunderforce
Face me evil bastards, smell the hate of angels
Glory, pride and bloodshed
Cowards and beholders, rapers of my wisdom
mix of dust and bones
Go back to your abyss, Algalord will not fall
but your heads will soon roll
Test the blade of heroes, fury of the thunder
hit my golden shield
So we'll fight against the wind for the glory of the kings
to defeat the evil enemies
And we'll ride with our lord for the power and the throne
in the name of holy thunderforce
So we'll fight against the wind for the glory of the kings
to defeat the evil enemies
And we'll ride with our lord for the power and the throne
in the name of holy thunderforce
So we'll fight against the wind for the glory of the kings
to defeat the evil enemies
And we'll ride with our lord for the power and the throne
in the name of holy thunderforce
The Village Of Dwarves
The dwarves of Lork are showing all their honour
when you walk on the Gandor secret hill
The dance for fire and wind
and the stories about old kings
are pleasing our brave lords
down in the village of dwarves
The elves are playing under timeless willows
while blue and red paint all my beloved land
The dance for fire and wind
and the stories about old kings
are pleasing our brave lords
down in the village of dwarves
The eagle's eye is hiding something tragic
but in this night the red wine rules in me
The dance for fire and wind
and the stories about old kings
are pleasing our brave lords
down in the village of dwarves
And all night long me Arwald and Aresius
we speak, we laugh, we honor our king
The dance for fire and wind
and the stories about old kings
are pleasing our brave lords
down in the village of dwarves
The eagle's eye is hiding something tragic
but in this night the red wine rules in me
The dance for fire and wind
and the stories about old kings
are pleasing our brave lords
down in the village of dwarves
And time has come now to ride
before the end of the night
the march of the swordmaster
to the unholy fight
And time has come now to ride
before the end of the night
the march of the swordmaster
to the unholy fight
Unholy fight
Unholy fight
Rain Of A Thousand Flames
DIES IRAE
REGNA NELL' OSCURITA'
Guardians of the moonlight bring the spell alive
trought the sphere of sorrow lead my holy ride
Titans of the desert face the warlord's pride
fighters from the near lakes join the tragic night
War of the ghostland take your souls
but give us freedom once and for all
...firestorm!
UNDER THE RAIN OF A THOUSAND FLAMES
WE FACE THE REAL PAIN FALLING IN VAIN
WHILE THE DARK ANGEL SCREAMS FOR VENGEANCE
IN THE DEAD SHADOW OF FALLING STARS
Silent cries of virgins touch the heart of night
raped by the demons under painful sights
Sperm and blood and terror chaos in my head
Is the law of evil triumph for the damned
War of the ghostland take your souls
but give us freedom once and for all
...firestorm!
UNDER THE RAIN OF A THOUSAND FLAMES
WE FACE THE REAL PAIN FALLING IN VAIN
WHILE THE DARK ANGEL SCREAMS FOR VENGEANCE
IN THE DEAD SHADOW OF FALLING STARS
...Moonlight is the witness of the most tragic day for our lands...
nothing seems possible to change the destiny of war...
Lament of heroes reach the deep skies
fill the wide cosmos and free my pain... my pain!
UNDER THE RAIN OF A THOUSAND FLAMES
WE FACE THE REAL PAIN FALLING IN VAIN
WHILE THE DARK ANGEL SCREAMS FOR VENGEANCE
IN THE DEAD SHADOW
OF FALLING STARS
DIES IRAE
Knightrider Of Doom
The fading illusion the sirens' grey tears
it's here in the cold air the town's tragic fear
The breath of infernos the rise of the dead
the portals of chaos the seventh black flame
IN THIS BLOODY DAWN
I WILL WASH MY SOUL
TO CALL THE SPIRIT OF VENGEANCE
TO DENY MY WISDOM FOR ANGER
TO BREAK THE SCREAM OF THE SILENT FOOL
AND TO BE THE SON OF DOOM...
IN THIS BLOOD DAWN
I WILL WASH MY SOUL
TO CALL THE SPIRIT OF VENGEANCE
TO DENY MY WISDOM FOR ANGER
TO BREAK THE SCREAM OF THE SILENT FOOL
TO BE A KNIGHTRIDER OF DOOM...
The rites of the unborn the dragonship's fall
the waves of my ocean the twins' holy call
The march of the heroes the call of the gods
after the rituals on the silent shore
IN THIS BLOODY DAWN
I WILL WASH MY SOUL
TO CALL THE SPIRIT OF VENGEANCE
TO DENY MY WISDOM FOR ANGER
TO BREAK THE SCREAM OF THE SILENT FOOL
AND TO BE THE SON OF DOOM...
IN THIS BLOODY DAWN
I WILL WASH MY SOUL
TO CALL THE SPIRIT OF VENGEANCE
TO DENY MY WISDOM FOR ANGER
TO BREAK THE SCREAM OF THE SILENT FOOL
TO BE A KNIGHTRIDER OF DOOM...
March Of The Swordmaster
Ride... die... sacrifice!
Along the river of bloody tears
the mighty steel shining in my hands
we march and honor our brothers
victims of Kron's evil plan
We cross the lakes of the holy woods
to reach the ocean where red waves rule
the black king is moving to Algalord
this is the time... he has to be stopped!
HAIL, HAIL!
...Brave Swordmaster!
MARCH, MARCH!
...Great Swordmaster!
and I ask the wind for the fall of the king...!
INTO THE RAY OF THE SUN
MARCH OUR HERO HUNTING THE DARKLORD
REBORN FROM THE BLOOD OF HIS GOD...
HIS GOD... THE WARMASTER KRON
RIDE FOR THE FALL OF HIS POWER
FIGHTING THE STORM, THE ROAR OF THE THUNDER
ALLY OF THE SUN AND THE MOON...
GREAT SWORDMASTER RULE!
Between the waves of the raging sea
echoes of warcries and battle hymns
the underworld's armies found their ancient queen
the funeral march in the depths of the abyss
The terror which strikes the honor which prays
will be face to face in the mortal doomsday
Resist my fierce soldiers their vision can kill
it will test your courage... and your will to live
HAIL, HAIL!
...Brave Swordmaster!
MARCH, MARCH!
...Great Swordmaster!
and I ask the wind for the fall of the king...!
INTO THE RAY OF THE SUN
MARCH OUR HERO HUNTING THE DARKLORD
REBORN FROM THE BLOOD OF HIS GOD...
HIS GOD... THE WARMASTER KRON

To avenge all those cries I will rise to the sky
to defend mother life...
Ride... die... sacrifice!
Power Of The Dragonflame
Rise mighty dragon...
Rise, rise, rise, rise...
Mighty dragon rise!
Ruins of ancient wisdom closing now my darkest lonely eye
god is dead in Thorald and in Elnor's rhyme
Mutilated bodies are now carved in ancient holy stone
tragic decoration of unholy wars
The heart of the dragon is screaming awaiting
to write the black last page
The page of blood was written by them...
the dead now lying on the sand
Visions of disaster are now challenging the
wild storms
cyclops of the midlands wash my bloody shore
Sirens from the open seas now heal my broken wounded brain
I call the holy typhoons... air, fire, earth!
The heart of the dragon is screaming awaiting
to write the black last page
The poem of blood was written by them...
the dead now lying on the sand
FROM THE SILENT HILL WE SCREAM LOUD YOUR NAME
MIGHTY POWER OF THE DRAGONFLAME
FROM THE MOUNTAINS PROUD AND STRONG
WE CALL OUR DRAGONLORD
Mighty dragon rise... rise!
Energie di cosmi estinti gridano sangue
dalle terre dell'ignoto senza pieta'
The heart of the dragon is screaming awaiting
to write the black last page
The poem of blood was written by them...
the dead now on the sand
FROM THE SILENT HILL WE SCREAM LOUD YOUR NAME
MIGHTY POWER OF THE DRAGONFLAME

WE CALL OUR DRAGONLORD
Unholy Warcry
"It was a good time for 
all creatures of the earth, 
but fate decreed that the dark 
prophecy of a demonknight 
could bring a tragic end to this peace 
scarring their lives forever!
Only one person could cross the 
Darklands surrounding Hargor 
and venture forth deep into 
the caves of Dark-Kunor. 
His is a name the world will never forget,
he is Dargor."
The dark lies a secret he is sworn to return to avenge the lost divine wars.

VANKAR'S THIRST FOR BLOODY VENGEANCE
VANKAR LIVES FOR VENGEANCEI detest your sanity
You're blinded by the light
Empty eyes of suffering
Get out of my life ...life
Take my hand and ride with me
Into the dark
I am the asexual
Tear out your heart ...heart
...Slow
Frightened by shadows
...You hide away
So weak in mind
...You fade away
Now your mind is dead forever
All left behind
Came to shake my hand again
Bow down and die!
Born to walk alone forever
I shall remain
Suffer now my child and see
I am insane! ...Insane
Before The Creation Of Time
Before the creation of time
When nothingness was all
And a fiery star's implosion
Caused the universe to fall
Worlds in utter chaos and plague
Were doomed to die at last
Vanished in the blackest void
A recreation of the past
Before the creation of time
When emptyness was all
Utter darkness enlights the way
To the surrounding walls
Journey through what mustn't be seen
To where no life dwells
Wisdom of the first creation
No one shall live to tell
Before the creation of time
When nothingness was all
And a blazing star's implosion
Caused the universe to fall
Memories of a frozen time beyond
There's nothing left to show
A new creation soon to be unleashed
In the shadowed depths below
Goodbye mother earth...
For They Shall Be Slain
Cursed are the lambs of god
For they shall be bled -
Whiter than the whitest snow
Christ is dead
Ancient lies - time to die
Cursed are the slaves of Islam
For they shall be slain
Religion of the lowest minds
Allah is dead
Ancient lies - time to die
Eternally their eyes shall bleed
For they shall be torn out
Vassals of a blind belief
Ancient dead
Ancient lies - time to die
If They Had Eyes (The Watchers Of The Earth)
If they had eyes
All they would have witnessed
Creature from the sea
Neanderthal to be...
Man has conquered athra
And to all the gods he gave birth
Though mountains of the dead
Are the watchers of the earth...
...High above the clouds
...Standing tall in might
...Darkness surrounds
...The mountain side
If they had eyes
All they would have witnessed
Creature from the sea
Evil men to be...
The Dark One
Stalking through the utter dark
Evil eyes glow in the distance
Prepared for a battle in rage
The end for the cruel adventurer
Blow to side - strike through eye
A battle-axe wields to charge
And separates head from body
Darkest blood flowing free
My eyes are filled with pleasure
Blow to side - strike through eye
A hunt for an ancient treasure
No herbs to restore his life
To die by an orchish arrow
Victorious the olog-hai
Slow you'll die - the dark one smiles
Into Glory Ride
Once upon
An evil time
Up in the north
Mighty men
Fought and died
By the sword
...Onward into glory ride
Into battle
Sign of the hammer
Be my guide
Standing proud
In victory
Into glory ride
...Onward into glory ride
To Birka we sail
(Birch Island)
And celebrate
Hail Thor
And the fallen
Join with Odin
At slain hall
(Valhalla)
...Onward into glory ride
...And The Laughter Has Died
Man of fashions flow - die
Time has come to say - goodbye
We spit on your - grave
Slay all in sight - rage
All their power's gone
A battle we have won
No more trust to them
This is the end
So is the utterdark - revenge
And now the laughter has - died
Unleashed
When they bring us holy water
We'll tear 'em down to the core
The cross of weakness burns to ashes
And Jesus Christ is no more
This is the way - we're unleashed
So they named us evil men
Evil minded yes we are
Living proud by the law of nature
By the hammer into war
This is the way - we're unleashed
...Join our side and we'll crush the enemy
When they bring us holy water
We'll tear 'em down to the core
The cross of weakness burns to ashes
And Jesus Christ is no more
Tsirhcitna - he's unleashed
...Beware...
Violent Ecstasy
I - am my own god and master
No one - will take my soul away
I - will rise in stern invasion
Die - the enemy I slay
Choose side, follow mine - take his fuckin' life
I - will enter no path of decay
Stabbing the dagger in their eye
I - will tear 'em down, for all to see
My revenge of all the false in mind
Choose side, follow mine - take his fuckin' life
I will set it free
Violent ecstasy
I will set it free
Violent ecstasy
I - am my own god and master
No one - will take my soul away
I - will rise in stern invasion
Die - the enemy I slay
Choose side, follow mine - take his fuckin' life
Where Life Ends
God of lies,
Slaughter and sacrifice
We spit in his face
And laugh as we die
...Where life ends
Mother Christ -
Your son we crucified
On a path to hell -
We choose to live our lives
...Where life ends
Where is the gate
To heaven of glory bright?
Vanished in the dark,
Where is the promised light?
No more shall we pray for peace
Never ever ask them why
No more shall we stop their visions
Of selfdestructing genocide
Dogs on leads march to war
Go ahead end it all...
Blow up the world
The final silence
Blow up the world
I don't give a damn!
Screams of terror, panic spreads
Bombs are raining from the sky
Bodies burning, all is dead
There's no place left to hide
Dogs on leads march to war
Go ahead end it all...
Blow up the world
The final silence
Blow up the world
I don't give a damn!
(A voice was heard from the battle field)
"Couldn't care less for a last goodbye
For as I die, so do all my enemies
There's no tomorrow, and no more today
So let us all fade away..."
Upon this ball of dirt we lived
Darkened clouds now to dwell
Wasted years of man's creation
The final silence now can tell
Dogs on leads march to war
Go ahead end it all...
Blow up the world
The final silence
Blow up the world
I don't give a damn!
The Immortals
Rise - my armies - with power - from Hell - we march...
When all their power's gone and nothing's left but shame
We are the evil ones, a pestilence they say
We tear their souls apart by just being what we are
...And to forever be the ones to blame
There's nothing here for us in their world of love and trust
We vomit in their eyes and face them with disgust
We are the tyrants of the darkness as they say
...And we will never obey
So rise - my armies - with power - from Hell - we march...
We leave your god behind, he's shaking with fright
See the hatred in our eyes shining so bright
Possessed by Hell itself we stand up to charge
...And rise from the flames
This is the time for vengeance, now their end is near
We strike with hateful power, we have no fear
We are the immortals of a never ending race
...And we shall fight 'til the end
Now the time has come
For all the fools to pray
Come on, face the slayer
Now's your time to pay
So rise - immortals - with power - and might - we slay...
A Life Beyond
A life beyond reality, a must to reach the only way out
So distant to this rotten world and I know - it isn't for me
I don't care of what they say, I am myself and live my own way
Like rats they run in life's eternal wheel - but they'll never
get me
Hear the silent whispers, all the talking heads and see all
their fake smiles
Protected by a wall of laws they hide - they dare not face me
Talking in circles to start confusion
(but empty words they fly through my mind)
With all their lies and prophecies they try - but they'll
never get me
... They'll never get me
With staring eyes they follow me
(it seems to be the peak of their lives)
I hate you all, why can't you fuckin' see - you cannot scare
me
Like an image passin' by I see it ends the day that I die
Until then I'll have powers left to fight - they'll never get
me
... They'll never get me
All that's left to say... as I turn away
I hate you all... and I will 'til I fall!!
A life beyond reality, a must to reach the only way out
So distant to this rotten world and I know - it isn't for me
I don't care what they say, I am myself and live my own way
Like rats they run in life's eternal wheel - but they'll never
get me
... They'll never get me
Shadows In The Deep
Shadows in the deep, once flesh and blood
Promised to finally see the light
Taking farewell of this life's mortal Hell
Hope to face the master, his blessings to tell
But lost are the souls who gaze into void
In search for a life beyond the grave
Still shadows bleed... eternally
Shadows in the deep, longing for life
Endlessly regretting the search for the light
The mortal life is gone but still shadows bleed
Tortured are the souls from a life without sins
An eternal wait for bodily ecstasy
To revel in lust, anger and greed
Still shadows bleed... eternally
Shadows in the deep, not for man to see
Captured here forever, never to be free
Taking farewell of this life's mortal Hell
Hope to face the master, his blessings to tell
But lost are the souls who gaze into void
In search for a life beyond the grave
Beyond the grave... shadows still bleed... eternally
Countess Bathory
Wellcoming the virgin's fair,
to live a noble life
In the castle known to all
The Count's infernal wife
She invites the peasants
with endless lavish foods
But, when evening spreads its wings
She rapes them of their blood
Countess Bathory
Countess Bathory
All day long the virgins sit
Feast on endless meals
The Countess laughs and sips her wine
Her skin both crack and peel
But when nighttime fills the air
One must pay the price
The Countess takes her midnight bath
with blood that once gave life
Countess Bathory
Countess Bathory
(Countess)
Countess Bathory
Countess Bathory
Living in her self-styled hell
the Countess dressed in black
Life so distant, death so near
no blood to turn time back
The castle walls are closing in
She's crippled now with age
Welcomes death with open arms
The Reaper turns the page
Countess Bathory
Countess Bathory
Never Ending Hate
Mindless people without a face
Cannot stand our human race
So they call us left behind
We laugh with pride, stand and fight
Never ending hate
Politicians in the lead
Empty brains they will feed
Never trust'em not a sound
Slay'em down to the ground
Never ending hate
Try to make us compromise
Listen fast simple minds!
No pretending, we don't care
Bangin' heads everywhere
Never ending hate
Try to push us off the way
Here and now is the time to slay -
The lowest form of human life
Are fashion wimps with lying eyes
With crushing power from within
Every battle we shall win
Man of clay say goodbye
We're unleashed step aside!
Never ending hate
Onward Into Countless Battles
Off we sail from Svea shores
To test our steel through out the world
Soon to come a raging battle
The strong will join and the weak shall fall
The army of immortals rise
To seek revenge of all the false
So we raise the hammer high
And call to Odin for a sign...
Join us in this holy war
Against the world and all it stands for
Crush the men of fashion's flow,
The slaves of Christ and the thrells of Islam
Riding on the blackest wind
We can't be stopped, we cannot fail
So we raise the horn of pride
And drink to glory and victory...
Onward into countless battles
We took the crown from sacred land
Soon return to Birka shores
Through storm, rain and hellish waters
Men of power, strength and might
Were born to live forever more
So we raise the hammer high
And call to Thor for a sign...
Crush The Skull
Preachers of the ancient lies
Hypocrisy the golden rule
I'm laughing with sardonic wrath
At each of your ten commands
Crush the skull - sacrifice
Crush the skull - die Christ
Cursed are the poor in spirit
For they shall be spat upon
Cursed are the weak in mind
For they shall inherit the yoke
Crush the skull - sacrifice
Crush the skull - die Christ
I gaze into his glassy eyes
And pluck him by the beard
I uplift a broadaxe
And split open his worm eaten skull
Crush the skull - sacrifice
Crush the skull - die Christ
Blessed are the strong in mind
For they shall possess the earth
Blessed are the evil ways
(the sins of life)
For they shall enlight the blind
Crush the skull - sacrifice
Crush the skull - die Christ
Bloodbath
Eyes cry
How nice
Screams of pain
Am I insane?
...Bloodbath
To hunt the prey
Makes my day
Break the bones
Blood flows
Torn apart
Sliced heart
Stench from Hell
I can tell
...Bloodbath
Cries - I hear nothing but - cries
Blood - I see nothing but - blood
...Bloodbath
Night fall
Victim crawl
Once again
I demand
...Bloodbath
Pain - I give nothing but - pain
Joy - I feel nothing but - joy
...Bloodbath
Land Of Ice
Silent nights
Under the winter sky
In the land of ice
Where the snow is white
Silent nights
And the northern breeze
In the land of ice
Where my soul is free
...My land of ice
Silent nights
On my ancestors ground
In the land of ice
Where the hooves of Sleipnir pound
Silent nights
And the oath is sworn
In the land of ice
As my son is born
...My land of ice
Silent nights
Where all shadows lay
In the land of ice
Oh, so far away
Silent nights
Where my eyes can see
In the land of ice
I shall rest in peace
Victims Of War
The sound of enormous bombs
Tearing apart the ground
Bursting, crashing, slashing
Black clouds fill the once blue sky
Everything set ablaze
Bursting, crashing, slashing
VICTIMS OF WAR
WAR
VICTIMS OF WAR
Bodies burned and ripped apart
Ashes and blood remains
Screaming, crying, dying
Agonizing repulsive screams
From all life that is left
Screaming, crying, dying
CHAOS
The infernal heat
Eating through the skin
Of all the innocent
That areleftto die
In this meaningless war
There's nothing more
Than those who pay
Welcome to doomsday!
VICTIMS OF WAR

The Defender
Down he rode from the hills where he was born
With sword and shield and baatle axe in hand
Young and strong he was the chosen one
To lead the armies and to defend his land
The day had come to kill the intruders
By the shore, the enemies now stand
ODIN GUIDE MY SWORD
AND I'LL SLAY THE ENEMY
ODIN GUIDE MY SWORD
TO ETERNAL VICTORY
Strenghtened by the words of his own father:
Son, you must be merciless and brave!
Never let them take an inch of land,
No, he'd never let his family be raped
Never let them march upon his fields,
No, he's never let his people be enslaved
ODIN GUIDE MY SWORD
AND I'LL SLAY THE ENEMY
ODIN GUIDE MY SWORD
TO ETERNAL VICTORY
Thor of might now throws his hammer in wrath
Thunder roar the lightning strikes the sky
Now the battle rages into chaos
Blood is running strong and the valkyries fly
Finally the defender stands victorious
And Vlahalla awaits for the brave who died
ODIN GUIDE MY SWORD
AND I'LL SLAY THE ENEMY
ODIN GUIDE MY SWORD
TO ETERNAL VICTORY
VICTORY
In The Name Of God
In the name of God
A preacher rapes a child
He puts his hand
On top of his little head
He says: My son
You mustn't be afraid
I am your friend
In the name of God
He now takes off his clothes
Caresses his legs 
So gently with his hands
He says: My son
You mustn't be afraid
I am your friend
(You have to trust me)
He says yeah
SUCK ON THIS OR ROT IN HELL
In the name of God
He now pools out his tool
And smiles, it hurts,
He enters from behind
He says: My son
You mustn't be afraid
I am your friend
In the name of God
When the blood is flowing free
And on the floor
The helpless body lies
He says: My son
There is the will of God
(You must have a faith)
HE SAYS YEAH
SUCK ON THIS OR ROT IN HELL
Religious harmony fills the air
Where the helpless bodylies
The erected member now was satisfied
God's messiah have had this way
Precious Land
Be hailed oh precious land
That in greatness and glory stands
Here where ancestors walked
Forever be my heart

Embrace the silence at night
Come lust and beauty great
Oh, precious land ba hailed

Berserk
One thousand years ago
In this land of ice and snow
Man lived with hatred just like me
The wrath lives on eternally
BERSERK
Feel no pain, there's only hate
No regret, it's all too late
I see your face, it's all I need
To grind you down and watch you bleed
BERSERK
My mind is blank, I am insane
You cry for mercy, cry in vain
I leave you trashed, for all to see
Berserk in me, eternally
BERSERK

Against The World
AGAINST THE WORLD
He was alone against the world
An outcast ever since birth
On and on night and day
They told him to behave
You must fit into society
Oh, how he tried but could not agree
Be like us and follow trends
No, he'd rather fight 'till the end
AGAINST THE WORLD
AGAINST THE WORLD
He was alone against the world
Every day a slave at work
Be a man don't make a sound!
Oh, he tried to tear him down
So he was one of a kind
But theycould not control his mind
And he knew the day will come
To take revenge on every one
AGAINST THE WORLD
Revenge
Doomed for all eternity
Cause I never could agree
A normal life I will deny
Do not bother asking why!
From the shadows where I dwell
Here's my way to give you hell
REVENGE
Years have passed and I'm still alive
Censorship is a fascist lie
A thousand times I'll rise again
You can't escape my last revenge
For all the times you've let me down
I'll crush your face into the ground
REVENGE
REVENGE
Come forth on precious hate
My vengeance is your fate
Come feel my last revenge
So painful until the end
REVENGE

Land of the free passed on to me
I hail to thee on precious land
Brave & grand so strong she stands
Reaching from the mountains high
Down to the woods where the ravens fly
To asgaard we fly

Ships return but soon to leave
For all the men in battle slain
Let their spirits guide the way
Warrior of faith and pride
A spirit that can never die
With sword & shield I stand on guard
I'll fight til'death, we'll never part

Dark desires

A strom of powers

I Am God
I am Jesus Christ
Hear my holy lies
I fool the poor & weak
To the light they seek
I sell the blessings for
dollars more
I am god
I kill people just for pleasure
I love to see them cry
And watch them slowly die
I lead every war
Trust in me for a better score
I don't care at all
If they stand or fall
I am God
I kill people just for pleasure
I plot a way for the destruction
Of the earth
To plague, starvation and diseases
I gave birth
I let them all die, cause my will
Is the law
The bullets of war are all mine
Yeah, I am God
I am Jesus Christ
Can't tou see the light?
I preach the holy way
Join or be my prey
I am god
I kill people just for pleasure
The One Insane
I am the psychopath
I live in my own world
I'll be the one you fear
...the one insane
People say I'm mad
And the one insane
I mustn't speak my word
And never to complain
They say I have the change
Cannot be this way
Must stay out of range
Now what can I say?
I am the psychopath
I live in my own world
I'll be the one you fear
...the one insane
So a doktor said
It was the best for me
To give me coloured pills
and neurosurgery
So I hit him with a hetchet
And ran from my cell
Need no special cure
To try keep my well
I am the psychopath
I live in my own world
I'll be the one you fear
...the one insane
Yes I migth be mad
And I am insane
But I'll speak my word
And I'll never change
I don't need to hear
All the things they say
Now what do I care
I'd never walk their ways
I am the psychopath
I live in my own world
I'll be the one you fear
...the one insane
Across The Open Sea
In The Northern Lands
Gods on high, behold...!
To thee I reach for might
Long ago in the northern lands
They sacrificed for might
Brothers Three who killed to give
Mortals land and sea
Midgaards rose from giant's flesh
Slaughtered to give life
Hail to the allseeing,
He who for wisdom gave his eye
Gods on high, behold...!
To thee I reach for might
The ravens flay across the plains
TO tell their master's tales
Tales beyond narrow minds
Weak lambs led astray
Our gift of blood & life to thee
O ancient heathen gods
Therefore now to thee we give
This human sacrifice
Gods on high, behold...!
To thee I reach for might
Long ago in the northern lands
They sacrificed for might
Brothers Three who killed to give
Mortals land and sea
Midgaards rose from giant's flesh
Slaughtered to give life
Hail to the allseeing,
He who for wisdom gave his eye
Forever Goodbye (2045)
Memories of a troubled past
Appears before my eyes
It seems to be the very last
I see before I fly
High above the earth and soon
To reach another day
The good old 1995
Is now just a memory
...goodbye
Flying high above the sky
As the planet burns
A journey to another world
There is no return
Visions are dancing in my mind
Of pictures never seen
Where the day and night are one
And life just cannot be
...goodbye
From the end of the universe
I scream in endless vain
I've realized I never will
See the sun again
I wonder as the hours pass
If someone will ever find
This message from another time
2045...
...forever... goodbye
Execute Them All
As my final call
Sounds the charge
...to war
I hate the universe and everything inside
I detest all I see, nothing pleases my mind
Execute them all
It's my final war
I hate the sight of you, fashion fake
Joke
I detest every man who cannot stand
Alone
Execute them all
It's my final war
As my final call
Sounds the charge
...to war
I hate the tales you tell, I don't
Believe a word
I detest the stuf you sell, I'll hunt
You around the world
Execute them all
It's my final war
When my days are numbered you'll hear
My final call
I'll take their lives away, I'll execute
Them all
Execute them all
It's my final war
Execute them all
It's my final war
Captured
I see the morning light breaking in
Another day, another hell within
Yesterday's sorrows come creeping by
Soon to remind my of tomorrow's lies
I gasp for air I scream for sight
Haven't seen anything yet that seems
To be right
I see the rats run their endless race
As I wake up to face another day...
(I must get... out)
...I'm captured
I see the darkness slowly fall
Into my room as I tear at the walls
And as a million dreams come sweeping by
Soon they will vanish like scattered lies
I reach for light but I cannot flee
An empty reality as all I see
I watch the mutants run their endless race
As I try to forget yet another day...
(I must get... out)
...I'm captured
I see the morning light breaking in
Another day, another hell within
Yesterday's sorrows come creeping by
Soon to remind my of tomorrow's lies
I gasp for air I scream for sight
Haven't seen anything yet that seems
To be right
I see the rats run their endless race
As I wake up to face another day...
(I must get... out)
...I'm captured
Breaking The Law
The road was completely wasting
Out of working down
All inside it's so first rating
As I turn in town in town
Fill that nobody care
Is darling watch out
Nothing could begin
To put action in my wife
Breaking the law
So much further don't do future
I kept it even start
How on break promise broken
Aching my heart
You don't know what is life
You don't have a clue
If you need you be yourself
Do the same thing too
Breaking the law
You don't know what is the life
The General
Up he rose & forth they went
Into the battleground, fortress, tent
Mountains, wilderness, fielsd & farm
The soldier & the general arm in arm
Off they ride
Side by side
"Through the travail of ages
Midst the pomp & toils of war
Have I fought, strove and perished
Countless times under the stars
As it through a glass and darkly
The ageal stripe I see
I fought in many guises, many names
But it was always me..."
Off they ride
Side by side
I was there in...
Lived & died...
So up he rose & forth they went
Into the battleground, fortress, tent
Mountains, wilderness, fielsd & farm
The soldier & the general arm in arm
Off they ride
Side by side
Blood Of Lies
A life in denial
Mindless and bleak
Herded as cattle
A sign of the weak
Heavens Sons
Now you bow
For the ones
To rule you now
Blood of lies
Spilling Forth
Feeble Flies
Say goodbye
Blood of lies
Blood of lies
Impotent, holy
All but a wraith
Cursing your idols
I spit on your faith
Ravage your angels
Crushing your gods
Gutting your prophets
I'll tear down you all
Heavens Sons
Now you bow
For the ones
To rule you now
Blood of lies
Spilling Forth
Feeble Flies
Say goodbye
Blood of lies
Blood of lies
This Is Our World Now

And dragged us all in the dust
Arguments of incompetence
Are easily returned and crushed
We will hunt you down

Hunt, hunt, the battle rages
The legions of Hell are here

The time of the common man is over
The age of the warrior has come!

Smoke is rising from the mountain
The mountain of doom
A great eye, lidless, wrapped in flame
On the tower of Barad-Dûr
We must join with him
We must join with Sauron
Or we have chosen death
We must join with him
We must join with Sauron
His gaze goes through
Cloud and shadow
Earth and through flesh
The lord of Mordor sees it all
Gathering all evil without rest
We must join with him
We must join with Sauron
Or we have chosen death
We must join with him
We must join with Sauron
We must join with him
We must join with Sauron
We must join with him
We must join with Sauron
Or we have chosen death

We may be torn and beat
But we have sworn to stand as one
In victory or defeat

From Hell we rise
We are the immortals
Death Metal - No compromise!
Triumph Of Genocide
Civilian killing squads
With clubs and machetes
So the killing starts
There is no escape
From the interahamwe
Clubbed, burned and raped
The triumph of genocide
The United Nations stood aside
And watched the triumph of genocide
Bodies floating down
The Kigara river
Tied, hacked and drowned
Average killing rate
Thousands by the day
The UN evacuates
The triumph of genocide
The United Nations stood aside
And watched the triumph of genocide
The Avenger
Upon this land his forefathers walked
The call from the past
That warms his heart
Decades pass by, the changing of time
Still there's a fire that burns inside
Odin... Hear my call!
Odin... Hear my call!
The struggle to survive
The seeds he has sown
All he has built can soon be gone
The deeds of white Christ
Which must be avenged
He summons the Gods,
for courage and strength
Odin... Hear my call!
Odin... Hear my call!
The cold wind blows
And the hour draws near
He must stand his ground
With shield and spear
Its time for the warrior
To defend his kin
For a new dawn to rise
Its a battle he must win
Odin... Hear my call!
Odin... Hear my call!
Odin... Hear my call!
Odin... Hear my call!
Salvation For Mankind
Stolen from a Roman cave
By a follower in need
Of a selfish holy tale
To plant the Christian seed
Took the bones and ran away
Resurrection is the sign
Soon he'll come to us again
It's salvation for mankind
Yeah, resurrect so I can vomit on the
The body of Christ
Yeah, resurrect so I can vomit on the
The body of Christ
Don't you see the holy sign?

Not a thing to be revealed!
Millions praying all in vain
For the secret to unwind
Waiting for the second coming
It's salvation for mankind
Yeah, resurrect so I can vomit on the
The body of Christ
Yeah, resurrect so I can vomit on the
The body of Christ
Psycho Killer
I'm all that you want me to be
Yeah, read about me soon
I drink the blood of babies fresh
I am impending doom
I kill for pleasure yes I do
Or is it out of greed?
Another day, another death
I'm what the public needs
I am a psycho killer
I am a psycho killer
The politicians love me too
I am a human shame
For unemployment and inflation
I am the one to blame
I'm a star in the evening news
A lamb left to die
Another story covered up
Some other fucking lie
I am a psycho killer
I am a psycho killer
I drink the blood of a newborn child
I'm all about death
I kill for pleasure yes I do
I confess
I am a psycho killer
I am a psycho killer
The Witch
Dressed in black, a flame from Hell
You feel her presence all too well
She'll take you for a magic ride
To Hell and back with legs astride
She'll take all that she needs
Leave your mind and soul to bleed
Dressed in black, a flame from Hell
The witch has casted her spell
Domination, lust will reign
Her lions are aflame
The nectar mixed with sweat
Dripping from her eager cleft
Shall act as pollen rain
To your slumbering brain
Dressed in black, a flame from Hell
The witch has casted her spell

Destruction (Of The Race Of Men)
Saruman commands his army
An army of 10strong
To march upon the land of Rohan
A war on man that must be won
From Isengard the Uruk-Hai march off to war
For destruction, destruction
For destruction of the race of men
Isengard has been unleashed
The Uruk-Hai march to war
They will leave no one alive
Helm's deep is soon to fall
From Isengard the Uruk-Hai march off to war
For destruction, destruction
For destruction of the race of men
Destruction, for destruction
For destruction of the race of men
"A new power is rising
It's victory is at hand"
"There will be no dawn of men"
Destruction, for destruction
Of the race of men
Destruction, for destruction
Of the race of men
Only The Dead
Only the dead
You open wide and prepare to receive
A hunger sex unseen
You crave hard penetration
And order me to come deep
You'd be all right just to suck me dry
But you can beg and plead...
I only fuck the dead
I only fuck the dead
Only the dead
This ain't no game, it's about life & death
To satisfy you needs
You demand a sensation
And crave my anal feed
You'd be all right with just a "golden rain"
But you can beg and plead...
I only fuck the dead
I only fuck the dead
Only the dead
The Longships Are Coming
Lindisfarne, holy land
Of pilgrimage for the christian man
Church of god, and monastery
8th of June, in the year of 793
The longships are coming
The longships are coming
The longships are coming
The longships are coming
Oh lord, hear us pray
Save us from the norsemen's rage
In despair, final grasp
The longships are coming
The longships are coming
The longships are coming
The longships are coming
Helljoy
There is no holy land
No better place to dwell
Here is our day of joy
Here and now is our hell
I am my own god
I am my own slave
There is no redeemer
To see me through the day
Helljoy - pressure of the flesh
Helljoy - indulgence 'til death
Helljoy - pressure of the flesh
Helljoy - indulgence 'til death
There is no glorious heaven
But the one you create
Live your life in sin
Live before it's too late
You must take control
Pleasure of the flesh
Cut the moral leash
Indulgence 'til death
Helljoy - pressure of the flesh
Helljoy - indulgence 'til death
Helljoy - pressure of the flesh
Helljoy - indulgence 'til death
Insane For Blood
Insane hunger, cold heart beating
Intense bloodlust, pressure increasing
All excited at every reek of death
Stop at nothing, must feed from human flesh
Insane for blood
Insane for blood
The frustration keeps on peaking
Internal torment pain comes creeping
The night's falling must seek another prey
A new source of blood to live another day
Insane for blood
Insane for blood
I Bring You Death
Once a friend
With open arms
A moment black
Now dagger sharp sits in my back
Felt the pain
Seeing red
It's all too late
Before my eyes the veil of hate
You took my soul, I'll take your flesh
So filled with rage I bring you death
I bring you death
I bring you death
On you knees
Before me bleed
How's it feel?
To be the one to be deceived
See the life
Now drain away
As you die
Your filthy pleas jusr pass me by
You took my soul, I'll take your flesh
So filled with rage I bring you death
I bring you death
I bring you death
Attack!
CEO
Rich parents and poor hygiene
Born in the 40's to a life of luxury
You sucked all the right cocks well
To get a really nice job your dad can tell
You call home and say you're working late
But there's another thing now that just can't wait...
What a leader the CEO!
His big secret just doesn't show
He pays a girl to get him through
Puts on his diaper and feed him gruel
A big house, the suburban dream you have
A boring ass wife and a daughter crack queen
You drink drive the brand new car
Na djust bribe another cop when you get caught
You whine out loud 'bout the income tax
Because the monthly 5Euros never last
What a leader the CEO!
His big secret just doesn't show
He pays a girl to get him through
Puts on his diaper and feed him gruel
One Night In Nazareth

Across the wide open Baltic sea
At Lagoda and Novgorod they settled
Slaves and fur they would trade for silver and silk
Forward to Miklagård
Forward to Miklagård
On the Dnjepr, they struggled to pass Aifur
Around Kiev, tribes and folk were gathered
And the new master's name was the infamous Rus!
Two thousand ships that sailed the Black sea...
Forward to Miklagård
Forward to Miklagård

Dissection Leftovers
Flesh... cat... flesh
I wake up at night so hungry for blood
The taste of a new corpse I feel
Illusions of bodies dismemberment fresh
Dissection leftovers for me
I break into a morgue or a hospital near
My organ erects eagerly
I search for the dishes the surgeon has left
Dissection leftovers for me
Flesh... cat... flesh
I revel in blood and I revel in flesh
There's never enough for my needs
I carve on the limbs and I chew with delight
Dissection leftovers for me
Flesh... cat... flesh
Peace, Piece By Piece
I am the one, the man, the myth with a knife
Destined to take your life
I am Mr. Insane
Now let me taste your pain
I'll cut you piece by piece
Oh man I feeled so pleased
Only death can end this show
Peace for my restless soul
I'm the god and I'm here to seal your fate
You'll suffer my evil hate
I am the Mr. Insane
Killing is just a game
I'll cut you piece by piece
Oh man I feeled so pleased
Only death can end this show
Peace for my restless soul
Peace, piece by piece
Burnt Alive
Burnt Alive
She was burnt Alive
Before the holy cross
The priest of christ he knelt
Oh help me mighty god
And save me from this hell
She still rejecting me
Oh god why can't she see
Tell me it's your will
To set my seed free
And god said:
In fire... you tie her...
To the stake... you witch
She was burnt alive
She was burnt alive
...burnt alive
Before the holy cross
Again he knelt and grinned
Oh help her mighty god
And save her from this sin
She cares not for my right
To take her when I please
It is the will of god
To set my seed free
And god said:
In fire... you tie her...
To the stake... you witch
She was burnt alive
She was burnt alive
She was burnt alive
She was burnt alive
...burnt alive
Your Head Is Mine
Your head is mine
With my choice of wine
I want your body and I want your flesh
I plunge the dagger in oh what a mess
I cannot stand and wait for you to die
Your body drenched in blood I'll eat you dead or alive
I feast on young ones and I feast on the old
I just gut'em up and spice'em then fold...
You are my evening dinner can't you see
I've got this special taste in humans I feed
Your head is mine
With my choice of wine
Your head is mine
With my choice of wine
I want your body and I need your flesh
I plunge the dagger in oh what a mess
I cannot stand and wait for your last cry
Your body drenched in blood I'll eat you dead or alive
I take the young ones and I take'em old
I just gut'em up and spice'em then fold...
You are my evening dinner can't you see

Courage Today, Victory Tomorrow!
At the ends of all things
Behold what nature brings
For what comes on the final day
You must be brave
Oh heed my call!
Courage today, victory tomorrow!
Courage today, victory tomorrow!
The great war of our time
Gods and men side by side
Like in the past as they fell
Some must survive to tell
The old tales without end
The legacy passed on again
In a new time, a new place
We shall live the ancient way
Oh heed my call!
Courage today, victory tomorrow!
Courage today, victory tomorrow!
Oh heed my call!
Courage today, victory tomorrow!
Courage today, victory tomorrow!
...and so it begins...
So It Begins
All that was the past
Comes to an end
Survive and evolve
Or die again
The hour of change
So definite in sight
Indiscriminately
The unprepared will die
So it begins
The unprepared will die
It is the dawn of truth
And it dominates
Like a pestilence
With no cure but fate
Rejuvenating death
The seeds of a new time
Induscriminately
The unprepared will die
So it begins
The unprepared will die
So it begins
The unprepared will die
It is the dawn of truth
...as Yggdrasil trembles...
As Yggdrasil Trembles
What troubles the earth, wind and sea
What powers will be unleashed
Is the age of mankind soon gone
Are we prepared for what will come
Whatever stirs beyond the dark has no shame
Nothing will ever be the same
Battalions of the world are you ready?
For the lasting cold and the darkness
Battalions of the world are you ready?
What will the future hold
What horrors are yet to unfold
Is this our way to Odin's hall
Are we prepared for the final call
Whatever stirs beyond the dark has no shame
Nothing will ever be the same
Battalions of the world are you ready?
For the lasting cold and the darkness
Battalions of the world are you ready?
As the mighty Yggdrasil trembles
Battalions of the world are you ready?
Our loyalty will be tested
Allegiance to Midgard we have sworn
As the mighty Yggdrasil trembles
We stand to face the new dawn
Battalions of the world are you ready?
For the lasting cold and the darkness
Battalions of the world are you ready?
As the mighty Yggdrasil trembles
Battalions of the world are you ready?
As the mighty Yggdrasil trembles
Battalions of the world are you ready?
Wir Kapitulieren Niemals
Wir kapitulieren niemals
(We will never surrender)
Face the fact here we are
You said we'd never come this far
Viking death metal
Viking death metal
We took you all for a ride
As years were passing by
Viking death metal
Viking death metal
Was andere sagen ist uns scheissegal
Wir kapitulieren niemals
(We will never surrender)
Risen from an ancient force
To the hammer we are sworn
Viking death metal
Viking death metal
Listen up and listen fast
We are the future and the past
Viking death metal
Viking death metal
Was andere sagen ist uns scheissegal
Wir kapitulieren niemals
(We will never surrender)
All the world against us
The enemy is great
But this is our life, this is our fate
We drink to Odin, we drink to Thor
With swords drawn onward into war
Was andere sagen ist uns scheissegal
Wir kapitulieren niemals
(We will never surrender)
This Time We Fight
So many years
He struggled hard
And stood against the oppression
He saw the fall
Of all his kin
In a dark premonition
As the battle rages
Will this be his day to die?
He holds his hammer toward the sky
This time we fight!
Now is the day
For the justice
So rightfully claimed
He called to arms
Sharpened his axe
And put on his chain
The call to rise
And be strong
As the hour grows near
A blot to Thor
For protection
And against all fear
As the battle rages
Will this be his day to die?
He holds his hammer toward the sky
This time we fight!
He holds his hammer toward the sky
This time we fight!
Master Of The Ancient Art
I rule the living
I claim the dead
Bringer of good and evil
As mankind will be led
I tame the winds of time
And decide all fate
The creator of purpose
Teacher of the ways
I am the master - master of the ancient art
I am the master - master of the ancient art
I am the warrior
Of the glory and the might
Tyr armed me with his sword
For the battle of life
I rule the kingdom of beasts
Oppose me and fall
Behold the most vicious animal
Of them all
I am the master - master of the ancient art
I am the master - master of the ancient art
Chief Einherjar
In a world of black and white
His colours blazed
A heart that burned like a thousand fires
With the passion to create
Every day a new challenge
Was taken by storm
Not a chance for a dampened spirit
As new ideas were born
I think you know...
You have my sword
Chief Einherjar
You have my sword
Chief Einherjar
All against the odds as trouble came
But no task to great
Gave us courage to stand the ground
Put no trust in fate
A true warrior, yes he was
Right until the end
In the halls of Valhalla
We shall meet again
I think you know...
You have my sword
Chief Einherjar
You have my sword
Chief Einherjar
Return Fire
You're think we're easy prey
A battle without losses
So load your guns and aim
Come at us anytime
With everything you've got!
Be the next in line (as we...)
Return fire, return fire...
Your chances will decrease
As Odin chooses side
Attack us and you'll see
We were born to fight
No mercy will be given
Target now in sight
Return fire, return fire...
Battalions lock and load
Guns ready, aim, fire!
Battalions on my command
Guns ready, aim, fire!
We rise against you all
In every town and nation
Until you flee or fall
The warriors of the brave
Now standing firm and strong
Will win or die this day
Return fire, return fire...
Better listen fast
This is our final warning
You cannot hope to last
Against the rapid fire
From one of our battalions
There will be no survival...
Return fire, return fire...
Battalions lock and load
Guns ready, aim, fire!
Battalions on my command
Guns ready, aim, fire!
Far Beyond HellDead To Me
The time is up, the dices are cast
So it came to this at last
The words you spoke were all too grand
No turning back you little man
And since you lack common sense
Suffer now the consequence
Suffer the consequence
Suffer the consequence
What you will experience is far beyond hell
So far beyond hell
A second chance you beg for me
Oh, i have ways to set you free
Your praying death comes without pain
Well killing isn't quite my game
I see now that you understand
For you i have this special pain
Suffer the consequence
Suffer the consequence
What you will experience is far beyond hell
So far beyond hell
What you will experience is far beyond hell
So far beyond hell
Dead To Me
Tied up in a moral life, made up like a play
Systematized and tamed
Play a role in every part, never step aside
Too boring and too lame
So you kneel...
And come crawling at my feet
You're dead to me
I'm not the one you seek
You're dead to me
Always living in the past and in lack of words
Searching for a fate
Waiting for the peak of life, it is all a dream
And it's getting much too late
Wake up to another world, all the same but new
The needs you cannot meet
Look around and face the fact, your time is running out
Christ is obsolete
Yet you kneel...
And come crawling at my feet
You're dead to me
I'm not the one you seek
You're dead to me
Yahweh And The Chosen Ones
You are a holy people to your god
And god has chosen you, this is your call
For all the earth is mine and you shall be onto me
A kingdom of priests and a holy nation above all
Our king is truth, and nothing else compares
Bow to the holy one
Blessed is he
Now to the holy one
Down on your knees
Praised are you, Lord our God, King of the universe
Who has chosen us out of all the nations on earth
Raised us above all tongues and made us holy
Through his commandments, we are holy from birth
Our king is truth, and nothing else compares
Bow to the holy one
Blessed is he
Now to the holy one
Down on your knees
For god did not make us like the nations of other lands
And did not make us the same as other families of the earth
God did not place us in the same situations as others
And our destiny is not the same as anyone else's
Bow to the holy one
Blessed is he
Now to the holy one
Down on your knees
Cannibalistic Epidemic Continues
O taste the goodness
Of our god
And eat his flesh
And drink his blood
Come and partake
In the gospel feast
Be saved from sin
And feel at peace
Cannibalistic epidemic continues
Cannibalistic epidemic continues
Embrace the holy communion!
Eat - this is my body
Drink - this is my blood
Give not that which a holy
To the dogs
Honour me as i die
Don't share me with hogs
Cannibalistic epidemic continues
Cannibalistic epidemic continues
Embrace the holy communion!
Eat - this is my body
Drink - this is my blood
Cannibalistic epidemic continues
Cannibalistic epidemic continues
Embrace the holy communion!
Eat - this is my body

The Greatest Of All Lies
Oppressing the poor, mocking the sick
Crusader of virtues, your holy fire lit
Blessed be the ones who will not fight
Against the words of the moral tyrant's might
The empty prayers of absolution that dies
Obedient souls bow to the passion of the Christ
The passion of the Christ
The greatest of all lies
The greatest of all lies
The Christian values a marketing game
Through holy wars and terror in your name
Upon this rock your church has been built
For all mankind, to live in fear and guilt
The empty prayers of absolution that dies
Obedient souls bow to the passion of the Christ
The passion of the Christ
The greatest of all lies
The greatest of all lies
Nailed to the cross, as death sets in
The blood of Christ spilled for all human sins
The great illusion of his final sigh
Obedient souls bow to the passion of the Christ
The passion of the Christ
The greatest of all lies
The greatest of all lies
My God, why hast thou forsaken me?
Long Before Winter's Call
Now it came to pass in those days
There went out a decree
From Caesar on his throne
That all the world should be enrolled
So Joseph took Mary to the balls
And from Nazareth they went
To the city of Bethlehem
For registration and taxing, right on then
The bastard child was born
Long before winter's call
The bastard child was born
Long before winter's call
And it came to pass, while they were there
That she was great with child
Lived in a stable 'til it was done
She brought forth her bastard son
And as the shepherds in the field
Were keeping watch over their flocks at night
An angel of the lord
Said unto them a saviour has been born
The bastard child was born
Long before winter's call
The bastard child was born
Long before winter's call
Your Children Will Burn
Religious filth, spreading like the plague
Bombs and prayers
The damage you've done, will not be gone
In a thousand years
The world had been a captive
I bring you
Destruction,hatred and terror
You will bleed for me
Destruction,hatred and terror
You children will burn
I laugh at your faith, you are all the same
Maggots of God
Prophets and priests, and their fascist beliefs
Will be torn apart
The world will be mine again
Destruction,hatred and terror
You will bleed for me
Destruction,hatred and terror
You children will burn

This Day Belongs To Me
Through mist and shadows dim
Stained with life ever so grim
Timeless travails in the utter dark
In the valleys of death i have walked
Now, is my time!
Odin, set me free
This day belongs to me
Face down in piles of human dirt
Endless pain that doesn't hurt
Torn apart yet physically whole
By the filth of man nothing grows
Now, is my time!
Odin, set me free
This day belongs to me
Marching Off To War
Free from their boundaries and chains
We march for revenge again
With our legions prepared by our side
To fight, to live and to die
The hour of truth is here
So we rise to the challenge everywhere
Marching off to war
Join or fall!
Behold as we march off to war
Cities shall burn and fall
Nothing can stop us now
By the hammer of Thor they shall bow
For the masters of art have returned
Our enemies' flag will be burned
The hour of truth is here
So we rise to the challenge everywhere
Marching off to war
Join or fall!
Behold as we march off to war
Cities shall burn and fail
Entering The Hall Of The Slain
Burning illness deep within
Demons haunt my every breath
All the years in agony
Staring into the eyes of death
....into the eyes of death
The time that was given to me
Alone with the thoughts some would dread
Staring into the eyes of death
Entering the hall of the slain
Entering the hall of the slain
I fear no God
I fear no pain
As my time has come
Entering the hall of the slain
Leave it all behind me now
Soil, wind and fire
No regrets as i bid farewell
Valkyries, come take me higher!
....come take me higher
The hour has struck for me
At the end of my conscious desire
So come, come take me higher....
Entering the hall of the slain
Entering the hall of the slain
I fear no God
I fear no pain
As my time has come
Entering the hall of the slain
Open wide the gates of Valhalla!
Black Horizon
Towards a black horizon
Our brothers are avenged, the battle is won
The longships set sail in the night
On the raging sea, with the stars as guide
Thoughts of those we could not sail,
The wounds i received and blows i gave
The darkness before my eyes
The freezing wind that chills my spine
Black Horizon....
Towards the black horizon
The waves that clashes to the side
The hunger and pain i must survive
Still i can feel the smell
Of my enemies blood and hear their cries for help
A glance from an axe blade shines
As memory of those i slayed this time
Long is our voyage at sea
To Birka shores, to the land of the free
Black Horizon....
Towards the black horizon
Thor, give me the strength
Like so many times before
Thor, give me the power
To bring us home to Birka shores
I raise my hammer in honour
Of those who'll never come home
I swear an oath to their fathers
I carve their names in stone
Black Horizon....
Towards the black horizon
Black Horizon....
Towards the black horizon
Carved In Stone
Gone, is the black horizon
But not the images of passed time
Dead are the many brave warriors
Who fought by my side
Who fought by my side
Now as i carve the names in stone
Of those who dies so far from home
I mean for these words to bring them pride
As time will pass, their deeds will never die
Accept this gift of eternal remembrance
For the courageous and bold
Thor, give these runes your blessing
As time will unfold
As time will unfold
Now as i carve the names in stone
Of those who dies so far from home
I mean for these words to bring them pride
As time will pass their deeds will never die....
Warriors Of Midgard
Politicians and employers
Lack of needed future knowledge
Protectionism is what they grow
Scared to death by the things we know
Never fall into their trap
Never buy their empty crap
Their institutions will fail
Our way of life prevail
The new breed that won't be led
Warriors of Midgard
we define the road ahead
Warriors of Midgard
Society of imitation
No place of innovation
Vassals of conformity
Want to end individuality
It's a zombie's dance all the way
And become just another prey
Their institutions will fail
Our way of life prevail
The new breed that won't be led
Warriors of Midgard
we define the road ahead
Warriors of Midgard
The new breed that won't be led
Warriors of Midgard
Midsummer Solstice
Nature stands erected
The season of the Sun
Gather around the stones
The time for blot has come
Light the fires of the north
Bring forth the goblets
A toast to our fortune
To Freya, Frey and fortune
Come lust for ecstasy
Unleash the seal of man
Come lust for ecstasy
It is Midsummer's Eve
Morbid spirits rising
Essence of the night
They sing a song of blasphemy
The demons dance tonight
Light the fires of the north
Bring forth the goblets
A toast to our fortune
To Freya, Frey and fortune
Come lust for ecstasy
Unleash the seal of man
Come lust for ecstasy
It is Midsummer's Eve
Home Of The Brave
As Gungir has beed thrown
Over the battle field
Brynhilde chooses her price
Among those with sword and shield
Home of the brave
Home of the brave
Where Odin awaits
Preparing for the final day
In the blood of every warrior
In the heart of honest men
In the souls of those who are dying
There is comfort at the end
Home of the brave
Home of the brave
Where Odin awaits
Preparing for the final day
....home of the brave
Welcome to Valhalla!
I Want You Dead
Common man you make me sick with hate
Nothing about you is real
Talk in circles to avoid the truth
All the things you must conceal
Prove your point just once and I'll give in
All the crap you need to say
Point your finger at us, brave like few
Standing safely miles away
I want you dead
I want you dead
Sacred son of yet an ugly bitch
Comprehension ain't your game
Christian looks - it is the look of your face
Lack of knowledge is your name
As i vomit in your general direction
Tears are falling as you flee
Walk the roads without a spark
I'll help you die as charity
I want you dead
I want you dead
So fucking dead
A New Day Will Rise
In the far distance
Under an unknown flag
A vast army appears
Will the great war end at last?
Overwhelming power
Hammer battalions on retreat
Overwhelming power
White Christ now flee
Our time will come
A new day will rise
Our time will come
A new day will rise
Our time will come
A new day will rise
Thousands of soldiers
Lying dead in the fields
Fires across the plains
Again the Folklands bleed
We await the return
Of the avanger of Odalheim
Our time will come
A new day will rise
Our time will come
A new day will rise
Our time will come
A new day will rise
Our time will come
A new day will rise
Our time will come
So stand proud...
A new day will rise
(Have faith my warriors
And stand strong, for a new day will rise)
Our time will come
A new day will rise
Our time will come
So stand proud...
A new day will rise
They Came To Die
In this cold aftermath
Where the blood has dried at last
Soldiers lay scattered around
In the fields of death, a fading sound
They came to die
They came to die
They came to die
A shameful march without a sound
With weapons pointed at the ground
They came out of the mist
So it all came down to this
Now approaching our lines
Heavens cry, their souls have died
Christ is dead or so it seems
Death before loyalty
They came to die
They came to die
They came to die
In nomine Patris et Filii et Spiritus Sancti
Death before loyalty
They came to die
They came to die
They came to die
In nomine Patris et Filii et Spiritus
They came to die
Defenders Of Midgard
Through the dark, dark caves
That was once built
By our fathers determination
Strength and will
But we will rise again
And fight, fight to defend
Our Midgard 'til the very end
Fight to defend
Our Midgard 'til the very end
A time to heal and prepare
For tomorrow
As we march with our minds
Black with sorrow
But we will rise again
And fight, fight to defend
Our Midgard 'til the very end
Fight to defend
Our Midgard 'til the very end
Through the dark, dark caves
That was once built
By our fathers determination
Strength and will
But we will rise again
And fight, fight to defend
Our Midgard 'til the very end
Fight to defend
Our Midgard 'til the very end
Fight to defend
Our Midgard 'til the very end
Fight to defend
Our Midgard 'til the very end
Where Is Your God Now?
Here we are alive again
In a battle without end
So we rise from the caves
And march until sol descends
Here we are. Who could tell?
We will all be unleashed from Hel
We will have our revenge
On the soil where our fathers fell
Where is your god now? 
Here we are, but he is gone
The search is on for the sacred one
Hiding out, a cowards game
White Christ in on the run
Here we are. Come out and play
Take his place, die in vain
Or send him out and he shall meet
The bolt thrower on the open plain
Where is your god now? 
Behold the crucifix.
What does it symbolize?
Pallid incompetence
Hanging on a tree
Here we are alive again
In a battle without end
So we rise from the caves
And march until sol descends
Here we are. Who could tell?
We will all be unleashed from Hel
We will have our revenge
On the soil where our fathers fell
Where is your god now? 
The Bolt Thrower
He was born of the northern wind
With a spirit of steel, destined to win
A master of war
A master of war that feels no pain
That feels no pain
Forged in the fires of Muspelheim
His will stood the test of time
A master of war that feels no pain
His loyals calling out his name...
The Bolt Thrower
The Bolt Thrower
A master of war
A master of war that feels no pain
That feels no pain
Long was our wait this night
As he called out White Christ to flight
Their time is up, no more hiding in shame
His loyals calling out his name...
The Bolt Thrower
The Bolt Thrower
He was born of the northern wind
With a spirit of steel, destined to win
A master of war that feels no pain
His loyals calling out his name...
The Bolt Thrower
The Bolt Thrower
Let The Hammer Fly
Onward into battle now
Fearless rage, gun them down
Some will fight, some will flee
Shoot them dead, watch them bleed
Thor rides his chariot
Rides across the sky
Let the Hammer fly
Kill them all
Leave none alive
Kill them all
Let the Hammer fly
Headless bodies on their knees
Upright as their torsos freeze
Falling down onto the snow
By the firing squads' massive blow
Vengeance now taken for their deeds
In the battle at Uppsala fields
God is still nowhere to be found
Did he flee to higher ground?
Thor rides his chariot
Rides across the sky
Let the Hammer fly
Kill them all
Leave none alive
Kill them all
Let the Hammer fly
Let the Hammer fly, let... the Hammer... fly
(Tyr draws his sword
The Spear of Odin is thrown
Thor rides his chariot
Hel will take her share)
Let the Hammer fly
Kill them all
Leave none alive
Kill them all
Let the Hammer fly
Where Churches Once Burned
The battle is over and we march again
Across the northern lands so grand
We take back all that once was given to us
Village by village, land by land
The cross of terror shall be set on fire
And burn like so many times before
Where churches once burned by our fathers' Vengeance
Again, behold the rule of Thor!
...behold the rule of Thor
Where churches once burned
Now behold the rule of Thor!
Ans so we're chasing White Christ off our lands
And burn their churches to the ground
We take back all that once was given to us
And reinstate the Hammer Now!
...reinstate the Hammer now
Where churches once burned
Now behold the rule of Thor!
Where churches once burned
Now behold the rule of Thor!
Land Of The Thousand Lakes
Behind us churches burn to ashes
The quest continues across the Baltic sea
(The Gulf of Bothnia)
To the land of the thousand lakes
Where the forest gives us time to rest and breathe
In a warrior's mind
His father's words from another time
Ride out my son
Ride forth tonight
Warriors so proud
Will fight by your side
We reached the clan of the wilderness
Our forces join in a blot for the dead
Together in the endless war
We speak of the past and what lies ahead
In a warrior's mind
His father's words from another time
Ride out my son
Ride forth tonight
Warriors so proud
Will fight by your side
And defend the helpless ones
So hold your head up high
Stand strong for your kin
And face the world with the nine...

Ride forth tonight
Warriors so proud
Will fight by your side

Welcome The Son Of Thor!
Our ships return to the shores of our Folklands
The sky is blue, a northern wind, it's a day so grand
He has returned!
He has returned!
Welcome the son of Thor!
The new age is born
Welcome the son of Thor!
The new age is born
Warriors standing proud, with raised fists, yelling hails

Fimbulwinter
In a time not far from ours
The lasting cold will prevail
The utter darkness will cover all
Nothing will ever be the same
The great ice will lose its grip
Its water will flood the earth
Like an ever flowing stream
Death and rebirth
The Fimbulwinter
The Fimbulwinter
The Fimbulwinter
Come Ragnarök...
Continent by continent
The black storms invade
And destroy everything
That comes in its way
Mother Nature takes back
What's rightfully hers
Ragnarök the liberator
Death and rebirth
The Fimbulwinter
The Fimbulwinter
The Fimbulwinter
Come Ragnarök...
Three years of lasting cold
Three years of darkness
Odalheim
From the ashes of the old world
A new one begin to take form
At the end of the great winter
The new age was born
Black is the dawn
As the new world appears
The air is all silent
We are still here
Rise Odalheim
Rise Odalheim
The winds of the aftermath
Sweeping the shores
Of our ancestor's land
Where we shall build once more
Rise Odalheim
Rise Odalheim
We are the warriors of Midgard
A kindred of mental bloodline
Hammer Battalions of the world
Stand up! This is our time!

As the new dawn is rising
The age of the warrior is here
Raise your hammers high
For Odalheim everywhere
White Christ
Rape, pillage, burn
As White Christ returns
Women scream in pain
Gutting children is a game
I have seen it before
I see the death
All that is left
Is their blood of lies
And the terror of White Christ
Death is slow
Burned eye sockets glow
With the light of Christ
Shining, oh so bright
Sawed-off limbs fouund
Scattered on the ground
Bodies without heads
Cut off as they fled
I have seen it before
I see the death
All that is left
Is their blood of lies
And the terror of White Christ
The blood of lies
The terror of White Christ
Rulers of the earth
Their message will be heard
Kneel to the cross
All will be lost
Rape, pillage, burn
As White Christ returns
Women scream in pain
Gutting children is a game
I see the death
All that is left
Is their blood of lies
And the terror of White Christ
The Hour Of Defeat
Healing the wounds
From the attack
Rest assured they'll be back
Time to prepare
And bury the sorrow
Our retaliation must follow
The hour to defeat, the hour to defeat
Blasting, bursting, will this be our time to retreat?
Blastint, bursting, the hour to defeat
Arming the forces
Now ready to fight
Odin, guide us tonight!
Grand is the view
Of our ships of war
Closing in at enemy shores
Sounding the charge
Fire at will!
The enemy standing still...
All against the odds
Their guns are too great
Outnumbered it is all to late
The hour to defeat, the hour to defeat
Blasting, bursting, the time has come for retreat
Blasting, bursting, the hour to defeat
Gathering The Battalions
Fled the guns blasting death
Through forest, field and sea
Decimated to extinction
The last of our kin yet free
Through a darkened land, once so proud and grand
Gathering the battailons, gathering the battailons
Terror now rule the lands
Where free men one walked
The ALthing council now decides to gather
The battailons of the world to a final war
On the ancient rrails of Norrland
We start journey to be free
Struggling through the Norwegian forest
Raching the coast finally
Through a darkened land, once so proud and grand
Gathering the battailons, gathering the battailons
Vinland
Left the coast of Norway behind
With the vengeance burning in our minds
All determined to return one day
As Soll will shine
Across the open sea, to Vinland and test our steel
Longships towards a black horizon
Like our fathers in the past
We shall have our victory at last
Rubble, chaos, death and decay
Through dead cities on our way
From the east coast to the west
Our forces grow by the day
Across the open sea, to Vinland and test our steel
Longships towards a black horizon
Like our fathers in the past
We shall have our victory at last
Fearless with swords drawn into battle
Like our fathers in the past
We shall have our victory at last

We shall fight on the beaches
Disembark and make them flee
We shall never surrender
Rule battailons, battailons rule the waves
Midgard Warriors never will be slaves
We shall fight in the fields
We shall fight in the jills
Marching fast in firm belief
We shall take back what's ours
We shall fight to the last man
We shall fight in the streets
Hunting White Christ off our land
We shall never surrender
Rule battailons, battailons rule the waves
Midgard Warriors never will be slaves
Hammers of Thor held high
We stand victorious, watching our enemies die
The Soil Of Our Fathers
Onward through the land of Gaul
Over the Pyrenees
Warriors are joining our quest
From the desolate cities
We shall struggle and toil
We shall fight again on our father's soil
March my warriors, march!
To reclaim our land
Fight proud my armies, fight!
On our way to the final stand
Gather with the Iberian battailons
Crossing the Ebro river again
Each day our numbers grow
Odin guide us to the very end
Marching to the Roman kingdom
Where the thirteenth legion rule supreme
Our forces now band together
And march against the tyranny
We shall struggle and toil
We shall fight again on our father's soil
March my warriors, march!
To reclaim our land
Fight proud my armies, fight!
On our way to the final stand
...the final stand
Germania
We march across the land
Over the mountains grand
And forests of fire
The black winds of death that sweeps
Through the empty cities
And deserted barbed wire
In this forsaken land
Once ruled by the pagan man
This is the hour!
Here where no life dwells
Where our fathers fell
We'll taje back what is ours
Through Saxon land
For the pagan man
Germania, Germania
Rebuild the Irminsul
Behold the Saxon rule
With reborn glory
Onward through heathen lands
For the pagan man
This is our glory
We shall build again
A kingdom without end
The old rule dying
Our future lies beyond
In history to come
Our dawn is rising
Through Saxon land
For the pagan man
Germania, Germania
The Great Battle Of Odalheim
Our journey has come to an end
The svithiod we have returned 
As Sol descends
On the winter solstice night
Our forces now prepare
For the final fight
A blot to Thor and Odin
As the morning breaks
The battle begins
The battailons of the world
At Uppsala fields
Their call is heard...
This is our world now!!!
The great battle of Odalheim
The great battle of Odalheim
The armies of White Christ
Now fire upon us all
Blitzkrieg light the sky
Warheads that explode
Shreds that burn their way
Into flesh and bone
Men cut in half
Blood rains from the sky
Breaking through enemy lines
Now close to victory
In the great war of our time
The great battle of Odalheim
The great battle of Odalheim
The armies of White Christ
No mercy behind enemy lines 
So close to victory
In the great war of our time
The great battle of Odalheim
The great battle of Odalheim
In the far distance 
Under an unkown flag
A vast army appears...
