I detest your sanity
You're blinded by the light
Empty eyes of suffering
Get out of my life ...life
Take my hand and ride with me
Into the dark
I am the asexual
Tear out your heart ...heart
...Slow
Frightened by shadows
...You hide away
So weak in mind
...You fade away
Now your mind is dead forever
All left behind
Came to shake my hand again
Bow down and die!
Born to walk alone forever
I shall remain
Suffer now my child and see
I am insane! ...Insane
Before The Creation Of Time
Before the creation of time
When nothingness was all
And a fiery star's implosion
Caused the universe to fall
Worlds in utter chaos and plague
Were doomed to die at last
Vanished in the blackest void
A recreation of the past
Before the creation of time
When emptyness was all
Utter darkness enlights the way
To the surrounding walls
Journey through what mustn't be seen
To where no life dwells
Wisdom of the first creation
No one shall live to tell
Before the creation of time
When nothingness was all
And a blazing star's implosion
Caused the universe to fall
Memories of a frozen time beyond
There's nothing left to show
A new creation soon to be unleashed
In the shadowed depths below
Goodbye mother earth...
For They Shall Be Slain
Cursed are the lambs of god
For they shall be bled -
Whiter than the whitest snow
Christ is dead
Ancient lies - time to die
Cursed are the slaves of Islam
For they shall be slain
Religion of the lowest minds
Allah is dead
Ancient lies - time to die
Eternally their eyes shall bleed
For they shall be torn out
Vassals of a blind belief
Ancient dead
Ancient lies - time to die
If They Had Eyes (The Watchers Of The Earth)
If they had eyes
All they would have witnessed
Creature from the sea
Neanderthal to be...
Man has conquered athra
And to all the gods he gave birth
Though mountains of the dead
Are the watchers of the earth...
...High above the clouds
...Standing tall in might
...Darkness surrounds
...The mountain side
If they had eyes
All they would have witnessed
Creature from the sea
Evil men to be...
The Dark One
Stalking through the utter dark
Evil eyes glow in the distance
Prepared for a battle in rage
The end for the cruel adventurer
Blow to side - strike through eye
A battle-axe wields to charge
And separates head from body
Darkest blood flowing free
My eyes are filled with pleasure
Blow to side - strike through eye
A hunt for an ancient treasure
No herbs to restore his life
To die by an orchish arrow
Victorious the olog-hai
Slow you'll die - the dark one smiles
Into Glory Ride
Once upon
An evil time
Up in the north
Mighty men
Fought and died
By the sword
...Onward into glory ride
Into battle
Sign of the hammer
Be my guide
Standing proud
In victory
Into glory ride
...Onward into glory ride
To Birka we sail
(Birch Island)
And celebrate
Hail Thor
And the fallen
Join with Odin
At slain hall
(Valhalla)
...Onward into glory ride
...And The Laughter Has Died
Man of fashions flow - die
Time has come to say - goodbye
We spit on your - grave
Slay all in sight - rage
All their power's gone
A battle we have won
No more trust to them
This is the end
So is the utterdark - revenge
And now the laughter has - died
Unleashed
When they bring us holy water
We'll tear 'em down to the core
The cross of weakness burns to ashes
And Jesus Christ is no more
This is the way - we're unleashed
So they named us evil men
Evil minded yes we are
Living proud by the law of nature
By the hammer into war
This is the way - we're unleashed
...Join our side and we'll crush the enemy
When they bring us holy water
We'll tear 'em down to the core
The cross of weakness burns to ashes
And Jesus Christ is no more
Tsirhcitna - he's unleashed
...Beware...
Violent Ecstasy
I - am my own god and master
No one - will take my soul away
I - will rise in stern invasion
Die - the enemy I slay
Choose side, follow mine - take his fuckin' life
I - will enter no path of decay
Stabbing the dagger in their eye
I - will tear 'em down, for all to see
My revenge of all the false in mind
Choose side, follow mine - take his fuckin' life
I will set it free
Violent ecstasy
I will set it free
Violent ecstasy
I - am my own god and master
No one - will take my soul away
I - will rise in stern invasion
Die - the enemy I slay
Choose side, follow mine - take his fuckin' life
Where Life Ends
God of lies,
Slaughter and sacrifice
We spit in his face
And laugh as we die
...Where life ends
Mother Christ -
Your son we crucified
On a path to hell -
We choose to live our lives
...Where life ends
Where is the gate
To heaven of glory bright?
Vanished in the dark,
Where is the promised light?

The Final Silence
No more shall we pray for peace
Never ever ask them why
No more shall we stop their visions
Of selfdestructing genocide
Dogs on leads march to war
Go ahead end it all...
Blow up the world
The final silence
Blow up the world
I don't give a damn!
Screams of terror, panic spreads
Bombs are raining from the sky
Bodies burning, all is dead
There's no place left to hide
Dogs on leads march to war
Go ahead end it all...
Blow up the world
The final silence
Blow up the world
I don't give a damn!
(A voice was heard from the battle field)
"Couldn't care less for a last goodbye
For as I die, so do all my enemies
There's no tomorrow, and no more today
So let us all fade away..."
Upon this ball of dirt we lived
Darkened clouds now to dwell
Wasted years of man's creation
The final silence now can tell
Dogs on leads march to war
Go ahead end it all...
Blow up the world
The final silence
Blow up the world
I don't give a damn!
The Immortals
Rise - my armies - with power - from Hell - we march...
When all their power's gone and nothing's left but shame
We are the evil ones, a pestilence they say
We tear their souls apart by just being what we are
...And to forever be the ones to blame
There's nothing here for us in their world of love and trust
We vomit in their eyes and face them with disgust
We are the tyrants of the darkness as they say
...And we will never obey
So rise - my armies - with power - from Hell - we march...
We leave your god behind, he's shaking with fright
See the hatred in our eyes shining so bright
Possessed by Hell itself we stand up to charge
...And rise from the flames
This is the time for vengeance, now their end is near
We strike with hateful power, we have no fear
We are the immortals of a never ending race
...And we shall fight 'til the end
Now the time has come
For all the fools to pray
Come on, face the slayer
Now's your time to pay
So rise - immortals - with power - and might - we slay...
A Life Beyond
A life beyond reality, a must to reach the only way out
So distant to this rotten world and I know - it isn't for me
I don't care of what they say, I am myself and live my own way
Like rats they run in life's eternal wheel - but they'll never
get me
Hear the silent whispers, all the talking heads and see all
their fake smiles
Protected by a wall of laws they hide - they dare not face me
Talking in circles to start confusion
(but empty words they fly through my mind)
With all their lies and prophecies they try - but they'll
never get me
... They'll never get me
With staring eyes they follow me
(it seems to be the peak of their lives)
I hate you all, why can't you fuckin' see - you cannot scare
me
Like an image passin' by I see it ends the day that I die
Until then I'll have powers left to fight - they'll never get
me
... They'll never get me
All that's left to say... as I turn away
I hate you all... and I will 'til I fall!!
A life beyond reality, a must to reach the only way out
So distant to this rotten world and I know - it isn't for me
I don't care what they say, I am myself and live my own way
Like rats they run in life's eternal wheel - but they'll never
get me
... They'll never get me
Shadows In The Deep
Shadows in the deep, once flesh and blood
Promised to finally see the light
Taking farewell of this life's mortal Hell
Hope to face the master, his blessings to tell
But lost are the souls who gaze into void
In search for a life beyond the grave
Still shadows bleed... eternally
Shadows in the deep, longing for life
Endlessly regretting the search for the light
The mortal life is gone but still shadows bleed
Tortured are the souls from a life without sins
An eternal wait for bodily ecstasy
To revel in lust, anger and greed
Still shadows bleed... eternally
Shadows in the deep, not for man to see
Captured here forever, never to be free
Taking farewell of this life's mortal Hell
Hope to face the master, his blessings to tell
But lost are the souls who gaze into void
In search for a life beyond the grave
Beyond the grave... shadows still bleed... eternally
Countess Bathory
Wellcoming the virgin's fair,
to live a noble life
In the castle known to all
The Count's infernal wife
She invites the peasants
with endless lavish foods
But, when evening spreads its wings
She rapes them of their blood
Countess Bathory
Countess Bathory
All day long the virgins sit
Feast on endless meals
The Countess laughs and sips her wine
Her skin both crack and peel
But when nighttime fills the air
One must pay the price
The Countess takes her midnight bath
with blood that once gave life
Countess Bathory
Countess Bathory
(Countess)
Countess Bathory
Countess Bathory
Living in her self-styled hell
the Countess dressed in black
Life so distant, death so near
no blood to turn time back
The castle walls are closing in
She's crippled now with age
Welcomes death with open arms
The Reaper turns the page
Countess Bathory
Countess Bathory
Never Ending Hate
Mindless people without a face
Cannot stand our human race
So they call us left behind
We laugh with pride, stand and fight
Never ending hate
Politicians in the lead
Empty brains they will feed
Never trust'em not a sound
Slay'em down to the ground
Never ending hate
Try to make us compromise
Listen fast simple minds!
No pretending, we don't care
Bangin' heads everywhere
Never ending hate
Try to push us off the way
Here and now is the time to slay -
The lowest form of human life
Are fashion wimps with lying eyes
With crushing power from within
Every battle we shall win
Man of clay say goodbye
We're unleashed step aside!
Never ending hate
Onward Into Countless Battles
Off we sail from Svea shores
To test our steel through out the world
Soon to come a raging battle
The strong will join and the weak shall fall
The army of immortals rise
To seek revenge of all the false
So we raise the hammer high
And call to Odin for a sign...
Join us in this holy war
Against the world and all it stands for
Crush the men of fashion's flow,
The slaves of Christ and the thrells of Islam
Riding on the blackest wind
We can't be stopped, we cannot fail
So we raise the horn of pride
And drink to glory and victory...
Onward into countless battles
We took the crown from sacred land
Soon return to Birka shores
Through storm, rain and hellish waters
Men of power, strength and might
Were born to live forever more
So we raise the hammer high
And call to Thor for a sign...
Crush The Skull
Preachers of the ancient lies
Hypocrisy the golden rule
I'm laughing with sardonic wrath
At each of your ten commands
Crush the skull - sacrifice
Crush the skull - die Christ
Cursed are the poor in spirit
For they shall be spat upon
Cursed are the weak in mind
For they shall inherit the yoke
Crush the skull - sacrifice
Crush the skull - die Christ
I gaze into his glassy eyes
And pluck him by the beard
I uplift a broadaxe
And split open his worm eaten skull
Crush the skull - sacrifice
Crush the skull - die Christ
Blessed are the strong in mind
For they shall possess the earth
Blessed are the evil ways
(the sins of life)
For they shall enlight the blind
Crush the skull - sacrifice
Crush the skull - die Christ
Bloodbath
Eyes cry
How nice
Screams of pain
Am I insane?
...Bloodbath
To hunt the prey
Makes my day
Break the bones
Blood flows
Torn apart
Sliced heart
Stench from Hell
I can tell
...Bloodbath
Cries - I hear nothing but - cries
Blood - I see nothing but - blood
...Bloodbath
Night fall
Victim crawl
Once again
I demand
...Bloodbath
Pain - I give nothing but - pain
Joy - I feel nothing but - joy
...Bloodbath
Land Of Ice
Silent nights
Under the winter sky
In the land of ice
Where the snow is white
Silent nights
And the northern breeze
In the land of ice
Where my soul is free
...My land of ice
Silent nights
On my ancestors ground
In the land of ice
Where the hooves of Sleipnir pound
Silent nights
And the oath is sworn
In the land of ice
As my son is born
...My land of ice
Silent nights
Where all shadows lay
In the land of ice
Oh, so far away
Silent nights
Where my eyes can see
In the land of ice
I shall rest in peace

Tearing apart the ground
Bursting, crashing, slashing
Black clouds fill the once blue sky
Everything set ablaze

Bodies burned and ripped apart
Ashes and blood remains
Screaming, crying, dying
Agonizing repulsive screams
From all life that is left

Eating through the skin
Of all the innocent
That areleftto die
In this meaningless war
There's nothing more
Than those who pay
Welcome to doomsday!

The Defender
Down he rode from the hills where he was born
With sword and shield and baatle axe in hand
Young and strong he was the chosen one
To lead the armies and to defend his land
The day had come to kill the intruders
By the shore, the enemies now stand
ODIN GUIDE MY SWORD
AND I'LL SLAY THE ENEMY
ODIN GUIDE MY SWORD
TO ETERNAL VICTORY
Strenghtened by the words of his own father:
Son, you must be merciless and brave!
Never let them take an inch of land,
No, he'd never let his family be raped
Never let them march upon his fields,
No, he's never let his people be enslaved
ODIN GUIDE MY SWORD
AND I'LL SLAY THE ENEMY
ODIN GUIDE MY SWORD
TO ETERNAL VICTORY
Thor of might now throws his hammer in wrath
Thunder roar the lightning strikes the sky
Now the battle rages into chaos
Blood is running strong and the valkyries fly
Finally the defender stands victorious
And Vlahalla awaits for the brave who died
ODIN GUIDE MY SWORD
AND I'LL SLAY THE ENEMY
ODIN GUIDE MY SWORD
TO ETERNAL VICTORY

In The Name Of God
In the name of God
A preacher rapes a child
He puts his hand
On top of his little head
He says: My son
You mustn't be afraid
I am your friend
In the name of God
He now takes off his clothes
Caresses his legs
So gently with his hands
He says: My son
You mustn't be afraid
I am your friend
(You have to trust me)
He says yeah
SUCK ON THIS OR ROT IN HELL
In the name of God
He now pools out his tool
And smiles, it hurts,
He enters from behind
He says: My son
You mustn't be afraid
I am your friend
In the name of God
When the blood is flowing free
And on the floor
The helpless body lies
He says: My son
There is the will of God
(You must have a faith)
HE SAYS YEAH
SUCK ON THIS OR ROT IN HELL
Religious harmony fills the air
Where the helpless bodylies
The erected member now was satisfied
God's messiah have had this way
Precious Land
Be hailed oh precious land
That in greatness and glory stands
Here where ancestors walked
Forever be my heart
PRECIOUS LAND

Oh, as the inter fades
Behold, the nature awakes
Oh, feel the wind caress
Here where my soul can rest

And bring forth life
Where spirits dwell

Come morning, day and light
Embrace the silence at night
Come lust and beauty great
Oh, precious land ba hailed

Berserk
One thousand years ago
In this land of ice and snow
Man lived with hatred just like me
The wrath lives on eternally
BERSERK
Feel no pain, there's only hate
No regret, it's all too late
I see your face, it's all I need
To grind you down and watch you bleed

My mind is blank, I am insane
You cry for mercy, cry in vain
I leave you trashed, for all to see
Berserk in me, eternally

Against The World
AGAINST THE WORLD
He was alone against the world
An outcast ever since birth
On and on night and day
They told him to behave
You must fit into society
Oh, how he tried but could not agree
Be like us and follow trends
No, he'd rather fight 'till the end
AGAINST THE WORLD
AGAINST THE WORLD
He was alone against the world
Every day a slave at work
Be a man don't make a sound!
Oh, he tried to tear him down
So he was one of a kind
But theycould not control his mind
And he knew the day will come
To take revenge on every one
AGAINST THE WORLD
Revenge
Doomed for all eternity
Cause I never could agree
A normal life I will deny
Do not bother asking why!
From the shadows where I dwell
Here's my way to give you hell
REVENGE
Years have passed and I'm still alive
Censorship is a fascist lie
A thousand times I'll rise again
You can't escape my last revenge
For all the times you've let me down
I'll crush your face into the ground
REVENGE
REVENGE
Come forth on precious hate
My vengeance is your fate
Come feel my last revenge
So painful until the end
REVENGE
REVENGE

To Asgaard We Fly
Guided by my father's call
End of search, I hear them all
Now my quest is to live your dream
Land of the free passed on to me
I hail to thee on precious land
Brave & grand so strong she stands
Reaching from the mountains high
Down to the woods where the ravens fly
To asgaard we fly
The spirit will never die
I gaze across the open sea
Ships return but soon to leave
For all the men in battle slain
Let their spirits guide the way
Warrior of faith and pride
A spirit that can never die
With sword & shield I stand on guard
I'll fight til'death, we'll never part
To asgaard we fly
The spirit will never die
Guided by my father's call
End of search, I hear them all
Now my quest is to live your dream
Land of the free passed on to me
I hail to thee on fatherland
Brave & grand so strong she stands
Reaching from the mountains high
Down to the woods where the ravens fly
To asgaard we fly
The spirit will never die
Open Wide
Evil wrath
Live forever
Deep inside

Growing hate
Rising higher
Open wide
Spit forth fire

As endless force
Silent churning

Dark desires

Evil wrath
Live forever
Deep inside
Strong as ever
Growing hate

I Am God
I am Jesus Christ
Hear my holy lies
I fool the poor & weak
To the light they seek
I sell the blessings for
dollars more
I am god
I kill people just for pleasure
I love to see them cry
And watch them slowly die
I lead every war
Trust in me for a better score
I don't care at all
If they stand or fall
I am God
I kill people just for pleasure
I plot a way for the destruction
Of the earth
To plague, starvation and diseases
I gave birth
I let them all die, cause my will
Is the law
The bullets of war are all mine
Yeah, I am God
I am Jesus Christ
Can't tou see the light?
I preach the holy way
Join or be my prey
I am god
I kill people just for pleasure
The One Insane
I am the psychopath
I live in my own world
I'll be the one you fear
...the one insane
People say I'm mad
And the one insane
I mustn't speak my word
And never to complain
They say I have the change
Cannot be this way
Must stay out of range
Now what can I say?
I am the psychopath
I live in my own world
I'll be the one you fear
...the one insane
So a doktor said
It was the best for me
To give me coloured pills
and neurosurgery
So I hit him with a hetchet
And ran from my cell
Need no special cure
To try keep my well
I am the psychopath
I live in my own world
I'll be the one you fear
...the one insane
Yes I migth be mad
And I am insane
But I'll speak my word
And I'll never change
I don't need to hear
All the things they say
Now what do I care
I'd never walk their ways
I am the psychopath
I live in my own world
I'll be the one you fear
...the one insane
Across The Open Sea
In The Northern Lands
Gods on high, behold...!
To thee I reach for might
Long ago in the northern lands
They sacrificed for might
Brothers Three who killed to give
Mortals land and sea
Midgaards rose from giant's flesh
Slaughtered to give life
Hail to the allseeing,
He who for wisdom gave his eye
Gods on high, behold...!
To thee I reach for might
The ravens flay across the plains
TO tell their master's tales
Tales beyond narrow minds
Weak lambs led astray
Our gift of blood & life to thee
O ancient heathen gods
Therefore now to thee we give
This human sacrifice
Gods on high, behold...!
To thee I reach for might
Long ago in the northern lands
They sacrificed for might
Brothers Three who killed to give
Mortals land and sea
Midgaards rose from giant's flesh
Slaughtered to give life
Hail to the allseeing,
He who for wisdom gave his eye
Forever Goodbye (2045)
Memories of a troubled past
Appears before my eyes
It seems to be the very last
I see before I fly
High above the earth and soon
To reach another day
The good old 1995
Is now just a memory
...goodbye
Flying high above the sky
As the planet burns
A journey to another world
There is no return
Visions are dancing in my mind
Of pictures never seen
Where the day and night are one
And life just cannot be
...goodbye
From the end of the universe
I scream in endless vain
I've realized I never will
See the sun again
I wonder as the hours pass
If someone will ever find
This message from another time
2045...
...forever... goodbye
Execute Them All
As my final call
Sounds the charge
...to war
I hate the universe and everything inside
I detest all I see, nothing pleases my mind
Execute them all
It's my final war
I hate the sight of you, fashion fake
Joke
I detest every man who cannot stand
Alone
Execute them all
It's my final war
As my final call
Sounds the charge
...to war
I hate the tales you tell, I don't
Believe a word
I detest the stuf you sell, I'll hunt
You around the world
Execute them all
It's my final war
When my days are numbered you'll hear
My final call
I'll take their lives away, I'll execute
Them all
Execute them all
It's my final war
Execute them all
It's my final war
Captured
I see the morning light breaking in
Another day, another hell within
Yesterday's sorrows come creeping by
Soon to remind my of tomorrow's lies
I gasp for air I scream for sight
Haven't seen anything yet that seems
To be right
I see the rats run their endless race
As I wake up to face another day...
(I must get... out)
...I'm captured
I see the darkness slowly fall
Into my room as I tear at the walls
And as a million dreams come sweeping by
Soon they will vanish like scattered lies
I reach for light but I cannot flee
An empty reality as all I see
I watch the mutants run their endless race
As I try to forget yet another day...
(I must get... out)
...I'm captured
I see the morning light breaking in
Another day, another hell within
Yesterday's sorrows come creeping by
Soon to remind my of tomorrow's lies
I gasp for air I scream for sight
Haven't seen anything yet that seems
To be right
I see the rats run their endless race
As I wake up to face another day...
(I must get... out)
...I'm captured
Breaking The Law
The road was completely wasting
Out of working down
All inside it's so first rating
As I turn in town in town
Fill that nobody care
Is darling watch out
Nothing could begin
To put action in my wife
Breaking the law
So much further don't do future
I kept it even start
How on break promise broken
Aching my heart
You don't know what is life
You don't have a clue
If you need you be yourself
Do the same thing too
Breaking the law
You don't know what is the life
The General
Up he rose & forth they went
Into the battleground, fortress, tent
Mountains, wilderness, fielsd & farm
The soldier & the general arm in arm
Off they ride
Side by side
"Through the travail of ages
Midst the pomp & toils of war
Have I fought, strove and perished
Countless times under the stars
As it through a glass and darkly
The ageal stripe I see
I fought in many guises, many names
But it was always me..."
Off they ride
Side by side
I was there in...
Lived & died...
So up he rose & forth they went
Into the battleground, fortress, tent
Mountains, wilderness, fielsd & farm
The soldier & the general arm in arm
Off they ride
Side by side

Blood Of Lies
A life in denial
Mindless and bleak
Herded as cattle
A sign of the weak
Heavens Sons
Now you bow
For the ones
To rule you now
Blood of lies
Spilling Forth
Feeble Flies
Say goodbye
Blood of lies
Blood of lies
Impotent, holy
All but a wraith
Cursing your idols
I spit on your faith
Ravage your angels
Crushing your gods
Gutting your prophets
I'll tear down you all
Heavens Sons
Now you bow
For the ones
To rule you now
Blood of lies
Spilling Forth
Feeble Flies
Say goodbye
Blood of lies
Blood of lies
This Is Our World Now
Too long you've slandered our name
And dragged us all in the dust
Arguments of incompetence
Are easily returned and crushed
We will hunt you down
This is our world now!
We will hunt you down
This is our world now!
Hunt, hunt, the battle rages
The legions of Hell are here
You can run but you can't hide
There's not even time for fear
We will hunt you down
This is our world now!
We will hunt you down
This is our world now!
The time of the common man is over
The age of the warrior has come!
We Must Join With Him
Smoke is rising from the mountain
The mountain of doom
A great eye, lidless, wrapped in flame
On the tower of Barad-Dûr
We must join with him
We must join with Sauron
Or we have chosen death
We must join with him
We must join with Sauron
His gaze goes through
Cloud and shadow
Earth and through flesh
The lord of Mordor sees it all
Gathering all evil without rest
We must join with him
We must join with Sauron
Or we have chosen death
We must join with him
We must join with Sauron
We must join with him
We must join with Sauron
We must join with him
We must join with Sauron
Or we have chosen death

In Victory Or Defeat
On the endless path of war
We may be torn and beat
But we have sworn to stand as one
In victory or defeat
We are the immortals
From Hell we rise
We are the immortals
Death Metal - No compromise!
Others follow the winds of change
You came to swear allegiance
No conformity at all
We didn't come to reason
We are the immortals
From Hell we rise
We are the immortals
Death Metal - No compromise!
We are the immortals
From Hell we rise
We are the immortals
Death Metal - No compromise!
Triumph Of Genocide
Civilian killing squads
With clubs and machetes
So the killing starts
There is no escape
From the interahamwe
Clubbed, burned and raped
The triumph of genocide
The United Nations stood aside
And watched the triumph of genocide
Bodies floating down
The Kigara river
Tied, hacked and drowned
Average killing rate
Thousands by the day
The UN evacuates
The triumph of genocide
The United Nations stood aside
And watched the triumph of genocide
The Avenger
Upon this land his forefathers walked
The call from the past
That warms his heart
Decades pass by, the changing of time
Still there's a fire that burns inside
Odin... Hear my call!
Odin... Hear my call!
The struggle to survive
The seeds he has sown
All he has built can soon be gone
The deeds of white Christ
Which must be avenged
He summons the Gods,
for courage and strength
Odin... Hear my call!
Odin... Hear my call!
The cold wind blows
And the hour draws near
He must stand his ground
With shield and spear
Its time for the warrior
To defend his kin
For a new dawn to rise
Its a battle he must win
Odin... Hear my call!
Odin... Hear my call!
Odin... Hear my call!
Odin... Hear my call!
Salvation For Mankind
Stolen from a Roman cave
By a follower in need
Of a selfish holy tale
To plant the Christian seed
Took the bones and ran away
Resurrection is the sign
Soon he'll come to us again
It's salvation for mankind
Yeah, resurrect so I can vomit on the
The body of Christ
Yeah, resurrect so I can vomit on the
The body of Christ
Don't you see the holy sign?
Its an act of God you've seen
Here's the proof, an empty tomb
Not a thing to be revealed!
Millions praying all in vain
For the secret to unwind
Waiting for the second coming
It's salvation for mankind
Yeah, resurrect so I can vomit on the
The body of Christ
Yeah, resurrect so I can vomit on the
The body of Christ
Psycho Killer
I'm all that you want me to be
Yeah, read about me soon
I drink the blood of babies fresh
I am impending doom
I kill for pleasure yes I do
Or is it out of greed?
Another day, another death
I'm what the public needs
I am a psycho killer
I am a psycho killer
The politicians love me too
I am a human shame
For unemployment and inflation
I am the one to blame
I'm a star in the evening news
A lamb left to die
Another story covered up
Some other fucking lie
I am a psycho killer
I am a psycho killer
I drink the blood of a newborn child
I'm all about death
I kill for pleasure yes I do
I confess
I am a psycho killer
I am a psycho killer
The Witch
Dressed in black, a flame from Hell
You feel her presence all too well
She'll take you for a magic ride
To Hell and back with legs astride
She'll take all that she needs
Leave your mind and soul to bleed
Dressed in black, a flame from Hell
The witch has casted her spell
Domination, lust will reign
Her lions are aflame
The nectar mixed with sweat
Dripping from her eager cleft
Shall act as pollen rain
To your slumbering brain
Dressed in black, a flame from Hell
The witch has casted her spell
I Have Sworn Allegiance
Welcome warriors of Unleashed
Tonight is our time to feast
You know its always worth the wait
Lets drink to Thor and celebrate
I have sworn allegiance

We've traveled far to prove our faith
No sacrifice can be too great
Our home is this Viking hall
United we shall stand or fall
I have sworn allegiance
I have sworn allegiance
I have sworn allegiance
Odin bade me his welcome
Into his hall of the slain
To reserve a place for the faithful ones
The immortals - The warriors of Unleashed
Who all swore to stand as one... forever
To you I have sworn, to you I have sworn
I have sworn allegiance eternally
Age Of The Warrior
Decades of despair, Christian decadence
And human defeat
Where no life dwells a new power grew
Like shadows in the deep
Immortal spirits bred in Hell
In time, all will see
It's the age of the warrior

The age of the warrior
Across the open sea, from land to land
It was time for victory
They fight so proud, with a warrior spirit
As Hell's unleashed
The have sworn allegiance,
With loyalty and pride
In time, all will see
It's the age of the warrior
The age of the warrior
The age of the warrior

A man of the ancient way
From a barren land he came
With a spirit forged of steel
To become a man that never kneels
To anyone or anything

The Hammer is his sign
The mark of faith

Brave men died this day
Oh the Valkyries fly
To choose from those who died
Oh the Valkyries fly

Forest silent waiting
Frozen winter breeze
Snowfall ever lasting
Covers mountains and fields

The triumph of nature & death
Ice... cold... winterland

Destruction (Of The Race Of Men)
Saruman commands his army
An army of 10strong
To march upon the land of Rohan
A war on man that must be won
From Isengard the Uruk-Hai march off to war
For destruction, destruction
For destruction of the race of men
Isengard has been unleashed
The Uruk-Hai march to war
They will leave no one alive
Helm's deep is soon to fall
From Isengard the Uruk-Hai march off to war
For destruction, destruction
For destruction of the race of men
Destruction, for destruction
For destruction of the race of men
"A new power is rising
It's victory is at hand"
"There will be no dawn of men"
Destruction, for destruction
Of the race of men
Destruction, for destruction
Of the race of men
Only The Dead
Only the dead
You open wide and prepare to receive
A hunger sex unseen
You crave hard penetration
And order me to come deep
You'd be all right just to suck me dry
But you can beg and plead...
I only fuck the dead
I only fuck the dead
Only the dead
This ain't no game, it's about life & death
To satisfy you needs
You demand a sensation
And crave my anal feed
You'd be all right with just a "golden rain"
But you can beg and plead...
I only fuck the dead
I only fuck the dead
Only the dead
The Longships Are Coming
Lindisfarne, holy land
Of pilgrimage for the christian man
Church of god, and monastery
8th of June, in the year of 793
The longships are coming
The longships are coming
The longships are coming

Helljoy
There is no holy land
No better place to dwell
Here is our day of joy
Here and now is our hell
I am my own god

There is no redeemer
To see me through the day
Helljoy - pressure of the flesh
Helljoy - indulgence 'til death
Helljoy - pressure of the flesh
Helljoy - indulgence 'til death
There is no glorious heaven
But the one you create
Live your life in sin
Live before it's too late
You must take control
Pleasure of the flesh
Cut the moral leash
Indulgence 'til death
Helljoy - pressure of the flesh
Helljoy - indulgence 'til death
Helljoy - pressure of the flesh
Helljoy - indulgence 'til death
Insane For Blood
Insane hunger, cold heart beating
Intense bloodlust, pressure increasing
All excited at every reek of death
Stop at nothing, must feed from human flesh
Insane for blood
Insane for blood
The frustration keeps on peaking
Internal torment pain comes creeping
The night's falling must seek another prey
A new source of blood to live another day
Insane for blood
Insane for blood
I Bring You Death
Once a friend
With open arms
A moment black
Now dagger sharp sits in my back

Before my eyes the veil of hate
You took my soul, I'll take your flesh
So filled with rage I bring you death
I bring you death

To be the one to be deceived

Your filthy pleas jusr pass me by
You took my soul, I'll take your flesh
So filled with rage I bring you death
I bring you death
I bring you death

Na djust bribe another cop when you get caught
You whine out loud 'bout the income tax
Because the monthly 5Euros never last
What a leader the CEO!
His big secret just doesn't show
He pays a girl to get him through
Puts on his diaper and feed him gruel

Slaves and fur they would trade for silver and silk

Around Kiev, tribes and folk were gathered
And the new master's name was the infamous Rus!
Two thousand ships that sailed the Black sea...
Forward to Miklagård
Forward to Miklagård

Cannot mix with the working man
Oh so proud, but you need it so bad

And you're switching fast
Mrs. Minister, becomes the dildo queen
Mrs. Minister, you jam it up
Then suck it clean

Dissection Leftovers
Flesh... cat... flesh
I wake up at night so hungry for blood
The taste of a new corpse I feel
Illusions of bodies dismemberment fresh
Dissection leftovers for me
I break into a morgue or a hospital near
My organ erects eagerly
I search for the dishes the surgeon has left
Dissection leftovers for me
Flesh... cat... flesh
I revel in blood and I revel in flesh
There's never enough for my needs
I carve on the limbs and I chew with delight
Dissection leftovers for me
Flesh... cat... flesh
Peace, Piece By Piece
I am the one, the man, the myth with a knife
Destined to take your life
I am Mr. Insane
Now let me taste your pain
I'll cut you piece by piece
Oh man I feeled so pleased
Only death can end this show
Peace for my restless soul
I'm the god and I'm here to seal your fate
You'll suffer my evil hate
I am the Mr. Insane
Killing is just a game
I'll cut you piece by piece
Oh man I feeled so pleased
Only death can end this show
Peace for my restless soul
Peace, piece by piece
Burnt Alive
Burnt Alive
She was burnt Alive
Before the holy cross
The priest of christ he knelt
Oh help me mighty god
And save me from this hell
She still rejecting me
Oh god why can't she see
Tell me it's your will
To set my seed free
And god said:
In fire... you tie her...
To the stake... you witch
She was burnt alive
She was burnt alive
...burnt alive
Before the holy cross
Again he knelt and grinned
Oh help her mighty god
And save her from this sin
She cares not for my right
To take her when I please
It is the will of god
To set my seed free
And god said:
In fire... you tie her...
To the stake... you witch
She was burnt alive
She was burnt alive
She was burnt alive
She was burnt alive
...burnt alive

Hero Of The Land
LONG AGO WHEN THE CENTURY WAS YOUNG
LIVED A MAN WHO PASSED HIS LAND ON TO HIS SON
LONG AGO WHEN THE MORAL OF MAN WAS HIGH
LIFE WAS A BATTLE JUST TO SURVIVE
EVERY DAY A STRUGGLE AND A TOIL
TO HARVEST THE LAND AND TO SEED THE SOIL
HE WORKED IN THE FOREST AND HE WORKED IN THE FIELDS
WORKED DAY AND NIGHT TO FEED HIS FAMILY
BEHOLD THE OLD MAN - STRIVING ALL HE CAN
BEHOLD THE OLD MAN - FOR HE IS THE HERO OF THE LAND
HE NEVER CARED MUCH FOR FORTUNE AND FAME
HE NEVER CRIED AND HE NEVER COMPLAINED
HE BUILT HIS DREAM WITH HIS BARE HANDS & MIND
A SIMPLE MAN BUT AN ARTIST OF LIFE
AND STILL TODAY AS I BEHOLD THE OLD MAN
I SEE HIM STRIVING ALL THAT HE CAN
ONE OF THESE DAYS HE'LL PASS HIS LAND ON TO HIS SON
LET HIS SPIRIT GUIDE US WHEN THIS CENTURY IS GONE...
BEHOLD THE OLD MAN - STRIVING ALL HE CAN
BEHOLD THE OLD MAN - FOR HE IS THE HERO OF THE LAND
ONE OF THESE DAYS... I'LL BE THE OLD MAN
AND I'LL WILL  FIGHT FOR MY FAMILY AND LAND
BEHOLD THE OLD MAN - STRIVING ALL HE CAN
BEHOLD THE OLD MAN - THE HERO OF THE LAND
BEHOLD THE OLD MAN - STRIVING ALL HE CAN
BEHOLD THE OLD MAN - FOR HE IS THE HERO OF THE LAND

UNLEASHED LYRICS
Courage Today, Victory Tomorrow!
At the ends of all things
Behold what nature brings
For what comes on the final day
You must be brave
Oh heed my call!
Courage today, victory tomorrow!
Courage today, victory tomorrow!
The great war of our time
Gods and men side by side
Like in the past as they fell
Some must survive to tell
The old tales without end
The legacy passed on again
In a new time, a new place
We shall live the ancient way
Oh heed my call!
Courage today, victory tomorrow!
Courage today, victory tomorrow!
Oh heed my call!
Courage today, victory tomorrow!
Courage today, victory tomorrow!
...and so it begins...
So It Begins
All that was the past
Comes to an end
Survive and evolve
Or die again
The hour of change
So definite in sight
Indiscriminately
The unprepared will die
So it begins
The unprepared will die
It is the dawn of truth
And it dominates
Like a pestilence
With no cure but fate
Rejuvenating death
The seeds of a new time
Induscriminately
The unprepared will die
So it begins
The unprepared will die
So it begins
The unprepared will die
It is the dawn of truth
...as Yggdrasil trembles...
As Yggdrasil Trembles
What troubles the earth, wind and sea
What powers will be unleashed
Is the age of mankind soon gone
Are we prepared for what will come
Whatever stirs beyond the dark has no shame
Nothing will ever be the same
Battalions of the world are you ready?
For the lasting cold and the darkness
Battalions of the world are you ready?
What will the future hold
What horrors are yet to unfold
Is this our way to Odin's hall
Are we prepared for the final call
Whatever stirs beyond the dark has no shame
Nothing will ever be the same
Battalions of the world are you ready?
For the lasting cold and the darkness
Battalions of the world are you ready?
As the mighty Yggdrasil trembles
Battalions of the world are you ready?
Our loyalty will be tested
Allegiance to Midgard we have sworn
As the mighty Yggdrasil trembles
We stand to face the new dawn
Battalions of the world are you ready?
For the lasting cold and the darkness
Battalions of the world are you ready?
As the mighty Yggdrasil trembles
Battalions of the world are you ready?
As the mighty Yggdrasil trembles
Battalions of the world are you ready?
Wir Kapitulieren Niemals
Wir kapitulieren niemals
(We will never surrender)
Face the fact here we are
You said we'd never come this far
Viking death metal
Viking death metal
We took you all for a ride
As years were passing by
Viking death metal
Viking death metal
Was andere sagen ist uns scheissegal
Wir kapitulieren niemals
(We will never surrender)
Risen from an ancient force
To the hammer we are sworn
Viking death metal
Viking death metal
Listen up and listen fast
We are the future and the past
Viking death metal
Viking death metal
Was andere sagen ist uns scheissegal
Wir kapitulieren niemals
(We will never surrender)
All the world against us
The enemy is great
But this is our life, this is our fate
We drink to Odin, we drink to Thor
With swords drawn onward into war
Was andere sagen ist uns scheissegal
Wir kapitulieren niemals
(We will never surrender)
This Time We Fight
So many years
He struggled hard
And stood against the oppression
He saw the fall
Of all his kin
In a dark premonition
As the battle rages
Will this be his day to die?
He holds his hammer toward the sky
This time we fight!
Now is the day
For the justice
So rightfully claimed
He called to arms
Sharpened his axe
And put on his chain
The call to rise
And be strong
As the hour grows near
A blot to Thor
For protection
And against all fear
As the battle rages
Will this be his day to die?
He holds his hammer toward the sky
This time we fight!
He holds his hammer toward the sky
This time we fight!
Master Of The Ancient Art
I rule the living
I claim the dead
Bringer of good and evil
As mankind will be led
I tame the winds of time
And decide all fate
The creator of purpose
Teacher of the ways
I am the master - master of the ancient art
I am the master - master of the ancient art
I am the warrior
Of the glory and the might
Tyr armed me with his sword
For the battle of life
I rule the kingdom of beasts
Oppose me and fall
Behold the most vicious animal
Of them all
I am the master - master of the ancient art
I am the master - master of the ancient art
Chief Einherjar
In a world of black and white
His colours blazed
A heart that burned like a thousand fires
With the passion to create
Every day a new challenge
Was taken by storm
Not a chance for a dampened spirit
As new ideas were born
I think you know...
You have my sword
Chief Einherjar
You have my sword
Chief Einherjar
All against the odds as trouble came
But no task to great
Gave us courage to stand the ground
Put no trust in fate
A true warrior, yes he was
Right until the end
In the halls of Valhalla
We shall meet again
I think you know...
You have my sword
Chief Einherjar
You have my sword
Chief Einherjar
Return Fire
You're think we're easy prey
A battle without losses
So load your guns and aim
Come at us anytime
With everything you've got!
Be the next in line (as we...)
Return fire, return fire...
Your chances will decrease
As Odin chooses side
Attack us and you'll see
We were born to fight
No mercy will be given
Target now in sight
Return fire, return fire...
Battalions lock and load
Guns ready, aim, fire!
Battalions on my command
Guns ready, aim, fire!
We rise against you all
In every town and nation
Until you flee or fall
The warriors of the brave
Now standing firm and strong
Will win or die this day
Return fire, return fire...
Better listen fast
This is our final warning
You cannot hope to last
Against the rapid fire
From one of our battalions
There will be no survival...
Return fire, return fire...
Battalions lock and load
Guns ready, aim, fire!
Battalions on my command
Guns ready, aim, fire!
Far Beyond HellDead To Me
The time is up, the dices are cast
So it came to this at last
The words you spoke were all too grand
No turning back you little man
And since you lack common sense
Suffer now the consequence
Suffer the consequence
Suffer the consequence
What you will experience is far beyond hell
So far beyond hell
A second chance you beg for me
Oh, i have ways to set you free
Your praying death comes without pain
Well killing isn't quite my game
I see now that you understand
For you i have this special pain
Suffer the consequence
Suffer the consequence
What you will experience is far beyond hell
So far beyond hell
What you will experience is far beyond hell
So far beyond hell
Dead To Me
Tied up in a moral life, made up like a play
Systematized and tamed
Play a role in every part, never step aside
Too boring and too lame
So you kneel...
And come crawling at my feet
You're dead to me
I'm not the one you seek
You're dead to me
Always living in the past and in lack of words
Searching for a fate
Waiting for the peak of life, it is all a dream
And it's getting much too late
Wake up to another world, all the same but new
The needs you cannot meet
Look around and face the fact, your time is running out
Christ is obsolete
Yet you kneel...
And come crawling at my feet
You're dead to me
I'm not the one you seek
You're dead to me
Yahweh And The Chosen Ones
You are a holy people to your god
And god has chosen you, this is your call
For all the earth is mine and you shall be onto me
A kingdom of priests and a holy nation above all
Our king is truth, and nothing else compares
Bow to the holy one
Blessed is he
Now to the holy one
Down on your knees
Praised are you, Lord our God, King of the universe
Who has chosen us out of all the nations on earth
Raised us above all tongues and made us holy
Through his commandments, we are holy from birth
Our king is truth, and nothing else compares
Bow to the holy one
Blessed is he
Now to the holy one
Down on your knees
For god did not make us like the nations of other lands
And did not make us the same as other families of the earth
God did not place us in the same situations as others
And our destiny is not the same as anyone else's
Bow to the holy one
Blessed is he
Now to the holy one
Down on your knees
Cannibalistic Epidemic Continues
O taste the goodness
Of our god
And eat his flesh
And drink his blood
Come and partake
In the gospel feast
Be saved from sin
And feel at peace
Cannibalistic epidemic continues
Cannibalistic epidemic continues
Embrace the holy communion!
Eat - this is my body
Drink - this is my blood
Give not that which a holy
To the dogs
Honour me as i die
Don't share me with hogs
Cannibalistic epidemic continues
Cannibalistic epidemic continues
Embrace the holy communion!
Eat - this is my body
Drink - this is my blood
Cannibalistic epidemic continues
Cannibalistic epidemic continues
Embrace the holy communion!
Eat - this is my body
Drink - this is my blood
Eat - this is my body
Drink - this is my blood
The Greatest Of All Lies
Oppressing the poor, mocking the sick
Crusader of virtues, your holy fire lit
Blessed be the ones who will not fight
Against the words of the moral tyrant's might
The empty prayers of absolution that dies
Obedient souls bow to the passion of the Christ
The passion of the Christ
The greatest of all lies
The greatest of all lies
The Christian values a marketing game
Through holy wars and terror in your name
Upon this rock your church has been built
For all mankind, to live in fear and guilt
The empty prayers of absolution that dies
Obedient souls bow to the passion of the Christ
The passion of the Christ
The greatest of all lies
The greatest of all lies
Nailed to the cross, as death sets in
The blood of Christ spilled for all human sins
The great illusion of his final sigh
Obedient souls bow to the passion of the Christ
The passion of the Christ
The greatest of all lies
The greatest of all lies
My God, why hast thou forsaken me?
Long Before Winter's Call
Now it came to pass in those days
There went out a decree
From Caesar on his throne
That all the world should be enrolled
So Joseph took Mary to the balls
And from Nazareth they went
To the city of Bethlehem
For registration and taxing, right on then
The bastard child was born
Long before winter's call
The bastard child was born
Long before winter's call
And it came to pass, while they were there
That she was great with child
Lived in a stable 'til it was done
She brought forth her bastard son
And as the shepherds in the field
Were keeping watch over their flocks at night
An angel of the lord
Said unto them a saviour has been born
The bastard child was born
Long before winter's call
The bastard child was born
Long before winter's call
Your Children Will Burn
Religious filth, spreading like the plague
Bombs and prayers
The damage you've done, will not be gone
In a thousand years
The world had been a captive
I bring you
Destruction,hatred and terror
You will bleed for me
Destruction,hatred and terror
You children will burn
I laugh at your faith, you are all the same
Maggots of God
Prophets and priests, and their fascist beliefs
Will be torn apart
The world will be mine again
Destruction,hatred and terror
You will bleed for me
Destruction,hatred and terror
You children will burn
Hammer Battalion
Onward pounding war machine
The hammer battalion Unleashed
Warheads armed with nuclear hate
Using humans as our bait
The order is to kill
Fire at will
The order is to kill
Fire at will
Hammer battalion Unleashed
Smashing through like rabid hounds
Walls they built fall to the ground
Those who oppose is flee or die
Death is marching on our side
The order is to kill
Fire at will
The order is to kill
Fire at will
Hammer battalion Unleashed
Join the battalion!
This Day Belongs To Me
Through mist and shadows dim
Stained with life ever so grim
Timeless travails in the utter dark
In the valleys of death i have walked
Now, is my time!
Odin, set me free
This day belongs to me
Face down in piles of human dirt
Endless pain that doesn't hurt
Torn apart yet physically whole
By the filth of man nothing grows
Now, is my time!
Odin, set me free
This day belongs to me
Marching Off To War
Free from their boundaries and chains
We march for revenge again
With our legions prepared by our side
To fight, to live and to die
The hour of truth is here
So we rise to the challenge everywhere
Marching off to war
Join or fall!
Behold as we march off to war
Cities shall burn and fall
Nothing can stop us now
By the hammer of Thor they shall bow
For the masters of art have returned
Our enemies' flag will be burned
The hour of truth is here
So we rise to the challenge everywhere
Marching off to war
Join or fall!
Behold as we march off to war
Cities shall burn and fail
Entering The Hall Of The Slain
Burning illness deep within
Demons haunt my every breath
All the years in agony
Staring into the eyes of death
....into the eyes of death
The time that was given to me
Alone with the thoughts some would dread
Staring into the eyes of death
Entering the hall of the slain
Entering the hall of the slain
I fear no God
I fear no pain
As my time has come
Entering the hall of the slain
Leave it all behind me now
Soil, wind and fire
No regrets as i bid farewell
Valkyries, come take me higher!
....come take me higher
The hour has struck for me
At the end of my conscious desire
So come, come take me higher....
Entering the hall of the slain
Entering the hall of the slain
I fear no God
I fear no pain
As my time has come
Entering the hall of the slain
Open wide the gates of Valhalla!
Black Horizon
Towards a black horizon
Our brothers are avenged, the battle is won
The longships set sail in the night
On the raging sea, with the stars as guide
Thoughts of those we could not sail,
The wounds i received and blows i gave
The darkness before my eyes
The freezing wind that chills my spine
Black Horizon....
Towards the black horizon
The waves that clashes to the side
The hunger and pain i must survive
Still i can feel the smell
Of my enemies blood and hear their cries for help
A glance from an axe blade shines
As memory of those i slayed this time
Long is our voyage at sea
To Birka shores, to the land of the free
Black Horizon....
Towards the black horizon
Thor, give me the strength
Like so many times before
Thor, give me the power
To bring us home to Birka shores
I raise my hammer in honour
Of those who'll never come home
I swear an oath to their fathers
I carve their names in stone
Black Horizon....
Towards the black horizon
Black Horizon....
Towards the black horizon
Carved In Stone
Gone, is the black horizon
But not the images of passed time
Dead are the many brave warriors
Who fought by my side
Who fought by my side
Now as i carve the names in stone
Of those who dies so far from home
I mean for these words to bring them pride
As time will pass, their deeds will never die
Accept this gift of eternal remembrance
For the courageous and bold
Thor, give these runes your blessing
As time will unfold
As time will unfold
Now as i carve the names in stone
Of those who dies so far from home
I mean for these words to bring them pride
As time will pass their deeds will never die....
Warriors Of Midgard
Politicians and employers
Lack of needed future knowledge
Protectionism is what they grow
Scared to death by the things we know
Never fall into their trap
Never buy their empty crap
Their institutions will fail
Our way of life prevail
The new breed that won't be led
Warriors of Midgard
we define the road ahead
Warriors of Midgard
Society of imitation
No place of innovation
Vassals of conformity
Want to end individuality
It's a zombie's dance all the way
And become just another prey
Their institutions will fail
Our way of life prevail
The new breed that won't be led
Warriors of Midgard
we define the road ahead
Warriors of Midgard
The new breed that won't be led
Warriors of Midgard
Midsummer Solstice
Nature stands erected
The season of the Sun
Gather around the stones
The time for blot has come
Light the fires of the north
Bring forth the goblets
A toast to our fortune
To Freya, Frey and fortune
Come lust for ecstasy
Unleash the seal of man
Come lust for ecstasy
It is Midsummer's Eve
Morbid spirits rising
Essence of the night
They sing a song of blasphemy
The demons dance tonight
Light the fires of the north
Bring forth the goblets
A toast to our fortune
To Freya, Frey and fortune
Come lust for ecstasy
Unleash the seal of man
Come lust for ecstasy
It is Midsummer's Eve
Home Of The Brave
As Gungir has beed thrown
Over the battle field
Brynhilde chooses her price
Among those with sword and shield
Home of the brave
Home of the brave
Where Odin awaits
Preparing for the final day
In the blood of every warrior
In the heart of honest men
In the souls of those who are dying
There is comfort at the end
Home of the brave
Home of the brave
Where Odin awaits
Preparing for the final day
....home of the brave
Welcome to Valhalla!
I Want You Dead
Common man you make me sick with hate
Nothing about you is real
Talk in circles to avoid the truth
All the things you must conceal
Prove your point just once and I'll give in
All the crap you need to say
Point your finger at us, brave like few
Standing safely miles away
I want you dead
I want you dead
Sacred son of yet an ugly bitch
Comprehension ain't your game
Christian looks - it is the look of your face
Lack of knowledge is your name
As i vomit in your general direction
Tears are falling as you flee
Walk the roads without a spark
I'll help you die as charity
I want you dead
I want you dead
So fucking dead
A New Day Will Rise
In the far distance
Under an unknown flag
A vast army appears
Will the great war end at last?
Overwhelming power
Hammer battalions on retreat
Overwhelming power
White Christ now flee
Our time will come
A new day will rise
Our time will come
A new day will rise
Our time will come
A new day will rise
Thousands of soldiers
Lying dead in the fields
Fires across the plains
Again the Folklands bleed
We await the return
Of the avanger of Odalheim
Our time will come
A new day will rise
Our time will come
A new day will rise
Our time will come
A new day will rise
Our time will come
A new day will rise
Our time will come
So stand proud...
A new day will rise
(Have faith my warriors
And stand strong, for a new day will rise)
Our time will come
A new day will rise
Our time will come
So stand proud...
A new day will rise
They Came To Die
In this cold aftermath
Where the blood has dried at last
Soldiers lay scattered around
In the fields of death, a fading sound
They came to die
They came to die
They came to die
A shameful march without a sound
With weapons pointed at the ground
They came out of the mist
So it all came down to this
Now approaching our lines
Heavens cry, their souls have died
Christ is dead or so it seems
Death before loyalty
They came to die
They came to die
They came to die
In nomine Patris et Filii et Spiritus Sancti
Death before loyalty
They came to die
They came to die
They came to die
In nomine Patris et Filii et Spiritus
They came to die
Defenders Of Midgard
Through the dark, dark caves
That was once built
By our fathers determination
Strength and will
But we will rise again
And fight, fight to defend
Our Midgard 'til the very end
Fight to defend
Our Midgard 'til the very end
A time to heal and prepare
For tomorrow
As we march with our minds
Black with sorrow
But we will rise again
And fight, fight to defend
Our Midgard 'til the very end
Fight to defend
Our Midgard 'til the very end
Through the dark, dark caves
That was once built
By our fathers determination
Strength and will
But we will rise again
And fight, fight to defend
Our Midgard 'til the very end
Fight to defend
Our Midgard 'til the very end
Fight to defend
Our Midgard 'til the very end
Fight to defend
Our Midgard 'til the very end
Where Is Your God Now?
Here we are alive again
In a battle without end
So we rise from the caves
And march until sol descends
Here we are. Who could tell?
We will all be unleashed from Hel
We will have our revenge
On the soil where our fathers fell
Where is your god now? 
Here we are, but he is gone
The search is on for the sacred one
Hiding out, a cowards game
White Christ in on the run
Here we are. Come out and play
Take his place, die in vain
Or send him out and he shall meet
The bolt thrower on the open plain
Where is your god now? 
Behold the crucifix.
What does it symbolize?
Pallid incompetence
Hanging on a tree
Here we are alive again
In a battle without end
So we rise from the caves
And march until sol descends
Here we are. Who could tell?
We will all be unleashed from Hel
We will have our revenge
On the soil where our fathers fell
Where is your god now? 
The Bolt Thrower
He was born of the northern wind
With a spirit of steel, destined to win
A master of war
A master of war that feels no pain
That feels no pain
Forged in the fires of Muspelheim
His will stood the test of time
A master of war that feels no pain
His loyals calling out his name...
The Bolt Thrower
The Bolt Thrower
A master of war
A master of war that feels no pain
That feels no pain
Long was our wait this night
As he called out White Christ to flight
Their time is up, no more hiding in shame
His loyals calling out his name...
The Bolt Thrower
The Bolt Thrower
He was born of the northern wind
With a spirit of steel, destined to win
A master of war that feels no pain
His loyals calling out his name...
The Bolt Thrower
The Bolt Thrower
Let The Hammer Fly
Onward into battle now
Fearless rage, gun them down
Some will fight, some will flee
Shoot them dead, watch them bleed
Thor rides his chariot
Rides across the sky
Let the Hammer fly
Kill them all
Leave none alive
Kill them all
Let the Hammer fly
Headless bodies on their knees
Upright as their torsos freeze
Falling down onto the snow
By the firing squads' massive blow
Vengeance now taken for their deeds
In the battle at Uppsala fields
God is still nowhere to be found
Did he flee to higher ground?
Thor rides his chariot
Rides across the sky
Let the Hammer fly
Kill them all
Leave none alive
Kill them all
Let the Hammer fly
Let the Hammer fly, let... the Hammer... fly
(Tyr draws his sword
The Spear of Odin is thrown
Thor rides his chariot
Hel will take her share)
Let the Hammer fly
Kill them all
Leave none alive
Kill them all
Let the Hammer fly
Where Churches Once Burned
The battle is over and we march again
Across the northern lands so grand
We take back all that once was given to us
Village by village, land by land
The cross of terror shall be set on fire
And burn like so many times before
Where churches once burned by our fathers' Vengeance
Again, behold the rule of Thor!
...behold the rule of Thor
Where churches once burned
Now behold the rule of Thor!
Ans so we're chasing White Christ off our lands
And burn their churches to the ground
We take back all that once was given to us
And reinstate the Hammer Now!
...reinstate the Hammer now
Where churches once burned
Now behold the rule of Thor!
Where churches once burned
Now behold the rule of Thor!
Land Of The Thousand Lakes
Behind us churches burn to ashes
The quest continues across the Baltic sea
(The Gulf of Bothnia)
To the land of the thousand lakes
Where the forest gives us time to rest and breathe
In a warrior's mind
His father's words from another time
Ride out my son
Ride forth tonight
Warriors so proud
Will fight by your side
We reached the clan of the wilderness
Our forces join in a blot for the dead
Together in the endless war
We speak of the past and what lies ahead
In a warrior's mind
His father's words from another time
Ride out my son
Ride forth tonight
Warriors so proud
Will fight by your side
And defend the helpless ones
So hold your head up high
Stand strong for your kin
And face the world with the nine...
In a warrior's mind
His father's words from another time
Ride out my son
Ride forth tonight
Warriors so proud
Will fight by your side

Welcome The Son Of Thor!
Our ships return to the shores of our Folklands
The sky is blue, a northern wind, it's a day so grand
He has returned!
He has returned!
Welcome the son of Thor!
The new age is born
Welcome the son of Thor!
The new age is born
Warriors standing proud, with raised fists, yelling hails
This is your day of truth, reckoning and prevail
Freedom from fascist Christ, his holiness is forever banned
Hope has now finally come to these forsaken lands
He has returned!
He has returned!
Welcome the son of Thor!
The new age is born

The new age is born
Our time has come
A new day has risen
Our time is now
Welcome the son of Thor!

Welcome the son of Thor!
The new age is born
Fimbulwinter
In a time not far from ours
The lasting cold will prevail
The utter darkness will cover all
Nothing will ever be the same
The great ice will lose its grip
Its water will flood the earth
Like an ever flowing stream
Death and rebirth
The Fimbulwinter
The Fimbulwinter
The Fimbulwinter
Come Ragnarök...
Continent by continent
The black storms invade
And destroy everything
That comes in its way
Mother Nature takes back
What's rightfully hers
Ragnarök the liberator
Death and rebirth
The Fimbulwinter
The Fimbulwinter
The Fimbulwinter
Come Ragnarök...
Three years of lasting cold
Three years of darkness
Odalheim
From the ashes of the old world
A new one begin to take form
At the end of the great winter
The new age was born
Black is the dawn
As the new world appears
The air is all silent
We are still here
Rise Odalheim
Rise Odalheim
The winds of the aftermath
Sweeping the shores
Of our ancestor's land
Where we shall build once more
Rise Odalheim
Rise Odalheim
We are the warriors of Midgard
A kindred of mental bloodline
Hammer Battalions of the world
Stand up! This is our time!
Rise Odalheim

Rise Odalheim
As the new dawn is rising
The age of the warrior is here
Raise your hammers high
For Odalheim everywhere
White Christ
Rape, pillage, burn
As White Christ returns
Women scream in pain
Gutting children is a game
I have seen it before
I see the death
All that is left
Is their blood of lies
And the terror of White Christ
Death is slow
Burned eye sockets glow
With the light of Christ
Shining, oh so bright
Sawed-off limbs fouund
Scattered on the ground
Bodies without heads
Cut off as they fled
I have seen it before
I see the death
All that is left
Is their blood of lies
And the terror of White Christ
The blood of lies
The terror of White Christ
Rulers of the earth
Their message will be heard
Kneel to the cross
All will be lost
Rape, pillage, burn
As White Christ returns
Women scream in pain
Gutting children is a game
I see the death
All that is left
Is their blood of lies
And the terror of White Christ
The Hour Of Defeat
Healing the wounds
From the attack
Rest assured they'll be back
Time to prepare
And bury the sorrow
Our retaliation must follow
The hour to defeat, the hour to defeat
Blasting, bursting, will this be our time to retreat?
Blastint, bursting, the hour to defeat
Arming the forces
Now ready to fight
Odin, guide us tonight!
Grand is the view
Of our ships of war
Closing in at enemy shores
Sounding the charge
Fire at will!
The enemy standing still...
All against the odds
Their guns are too great
Outnumbered it is all to late
The hour to defeat, the hour to defeat
Blasting, bursting, the time has come for retreat
Blasting, bursting, the hour to defeat
Gathering The Battalions
Fled the guns blasting death
Through forest, field and sea
Decimated to extinction
The last of our kin yet free
Through a darkened land, once so proud and grand
Gathering the battailons, gathering the battailons
Terror now rule the lands
Where free men one walked
The ALthing council now decides to gather
The battailons of the world to a final war
On the ancient rrails of Norrland
We start journey to be free
Struggling through the Norwegian forest
Raching the coast finally
Through a darkened land, once so proud and grand
Gathering the battailons, gathering the battailons
Vinland
Left the coast of Norway behind
With the vengeance burning in our minds
All determined to return one day
As Soll will shine
Across the open sea, to Vinland and test our steel
Longships towards a black horizon
Like our fathers in the past
We shall have our victory at last
Rubble, chaos, death and decay
Through dead cities on our way
From the east coast to the west
Our forces grow by the day
Across the open sea, to Vinland and test our steel
Longships towards a black horizon
Like our fathers in the past
We shall have our victory at last
Fearless with swords drawn into battle
Like our fathers in the past
We shall have our victory at last
Rise Of The Maya Warriors
Over the mountains we travelled far
Over the sierra madre occidental
We have come to join
The rise of the maya warriors
The rise of the maya warriors
Join the rebellion and the ancient rites

Let the drums of war begin

The rise of the maya warriors
El ascenco de los guerreros mayas
El ascenco de los guerreros mayas
By Celtic And British Shores
We shall fight on the seas
We shall fight on the beaches
Disembark and make them flee
We shall never surrender
Rule battailons, battailons rule the waves
Midgard Warriors never will be slaves
We shall fight in the fields
We shall fight in the jills
Marching fast in firm belief
We shall take back what's ours
We shall fight to the last man
We shall fight in the streets
Hunting White Christ off our land
We shall never surrender
Rule battailons, battailons rule the waves
Midgard Warriors never will be slaves
Hammers of Thor held high
We stand victorious, watching our enemies die
The Soil Of Our Fathers
Onward through the land of Gaul
Over the Pyrenees
Warriors are joining our quest
From the desolate cities
We shall struggle and toil
We shall fight again on our father's soil
March my warriors, march!
To reclaim our land
Fight proud my armies, fight!
On our way to the final stand
Gather with the Iberian battailons
Crossing the Ebro river again
Each day our numbers grow
Odin guide us to the very end
Marching to the Roman kingdom
Where the thirteenth legion rule supreme
Our forces now band together
And march against the tyranny
We shall struggle and toil
We shall fight again on our father's soil
March my warriors, march!
To reclaim our land
Fight proud my armies, fight!
On our way to the final stand
...the final stand
Germania
We march across the land
Over the mountains grand
And forests of fire
The black winds of death that sweeps
Through the empty cities
And deserted barbed wire
In this forsaken land
Once ruled by the pagan man
This is the hour!
Here where no life dwells
Where our fathers fell
We'll taje back what is ours
Through Saxon land
For the pagan man
Germania, Germania
Rebuild the Irminsul
Behold the Saxon rule
With reborn glory
Onward through heathen lands
For the pagan man
This is our glory
We shall build again
A kingdom without end
The old rule dying
Our future lies beyond
In history to come
Our dawn is rising
Through Saxon land
For the pagan man
Germania, Germania
The Great Battle Of Odalheim
Our journey has come to an end
The svithiod we have returned 
As Sol descends
On the winter solstice night
Our forces now prepare
For the final fight
A blot to Thor and Odin
As the morning breaks
The battle begins
The battailons of the world
At Uppsala fields
Their call is heard...
This is our world now!!!
The great battle of Odalheim
The great battle of Odalheim
The armies of White Christ
Now fire upon us all
Blitzkrieg light the sky
Warheads that explode
Shreds that burn their way
Into flesh and bone
Men cut in half
Blood rains from the sky
Breaking through enemy lines
Now close to victory
In the great war of our time
The great battle of Odalheim
The great battle of Odalheim
The armies of White Christ
No mercy behind enemy lines 
So close to victory
In the great war of our time
The great battle of Odalheim
The great battle of Odalheim
In the far distance 
Under an unkown flag
A vast army appears...
