The Quickening
Heart Of Storm
Rising from the ruins
Yet my mind is burning
Flames reflect those years of torment
Life that drowned in fire
Death was my desire
Path of hate was a relief for me
And then we stood there eye to eye
The darkest grief against a pure heart
Life baptised in metal By the secret of steel you are blessed, hail!!!
Gift of power helps you vanquish All the mortal's plagues
Heart of storm - I feel... the force is clean again
Heart of storm - deep inside of me
Heart of storm - and when I tear all roots of pain,
Heart of storm - grief and agony, then I'll be free
Hey! Ride on the wind!
Lightning pierced my body
Back again I'm rising
Now you hear my primal calling
Shout out even higher
War's now our revival!
Voice of truth is cryin' out for me
And now we're standing side by side
The tamed old hatreds next to mine
Watch me ride on the thunder
Followed by the warriors of steel, hail!!!
Strive for justice, fight for freedom
Yeah! This war is real!
Heart of storm - I know... the force is clean again
Heart of storm - all inside of me
Heart of storm - and now I kill all grief and pain
Heart of storm - Hey! And I kill the misery!
Now the force is clean again
All inside of me
And as I've killed all grief and pain
I crushed the agony, and now I'm free
And my heart of storm
I know... I know everything
I am everything
I'm alive
Sworn In Metal Wind
Walking in the shadow of life's dreary side
Fallen down memory lane
Winds whip the world, just like the woes whip my mind
Where is that time when "right now" was The words
When the heart burned with will like a flare
All I now keep is just damned commonplace misery
Hey man! What is this?!
Sounds like wail of a wimp
Did you let loser side take command?!
Where's the warrior in you
And the spirit he got
You say - "lost"
No! It's somewhere inside
And you know there's a force that unites all of us
Leave the wasteland we together will!
If you're broken, remember, you got faith within us!
Take now your next deep breath and revive
your old strength
Facing the abyss of heart's lonely grief
The bitch has polluted my soul
Rains flood the earth, just like the tears flood my eyes
Never again will my life be the same
Nothing can heal up my wounds
Guile and disgrace shall now follow me into the end
I just can not believe it
It's too weak to be true
Have you really forgotten your worth?!
Can't you see victory!?
You are now free again!
Look at me!
Yeah! I live my own life
If you once tasted treason from a female - leave that!
Every warrior has a gash on his sword
Don't forget you are metal, not some ass-kissing whore
Take some under your wings, but she must kiss the ring!
Winds of metal, make me once again
feel clear air's breath blowing in my wings!
I possess magic force
I am free in my words
Whole the world lays right below my feet
Life of duties and dogmas are just frames formed by rats
How'd I know?
Hey! I'm a guardian of truth
Now! Is really the time to wake up you old jade
Such as Phoenix spreads his firewings
I will help you remember by kicking your ass
And the will shall return
And again hearts shall burn
All the horns now will sing
Leading you back to the metal winds
The Song Of Air
World Through My Fateless Eyes
In the dawn of me, back at my spring of life
A mystic cry touched my soul
Just like a dream... a shine filled up it's sphere
My mind it was free and the secret's key was for me there
Magic voice that came... strain from another world
Of beauty not to believe
All then I heard was for me like a soul's reverie
And the voice... it sang my name
And through the all painful years that should come
That magic was there by my side
Power that led to I lost fear of death
Hatred that covered its meaning
I hail my senses that help me to see
so clear in my mind
All rotten "truth" and the doctrines which words
make us blind
I see the world through my fateless eyes
Pain be the sign, and the insight the guide
On this journey of unforeseen end
Enlightened by force of the unflagging faith
Through these wastelands I walk my own path
Damn the fate! You're one with your soul
and you must pave it's way by yourself
Out of nowhere the storm is coming on
The blare that surrounds helps me dream in
Enchanting me, while the spirit is rising again
And the storm... it sings my name
So as I walk on the path I believe
The force's always gracing my steps
Now in the name of the new risen will
I shall discomfit my fear!
And when the pinions of knowledge
like thunder, so mighty, will carry me on
All pain and grief and the weakness in me
shall be gone
I see the world through my fateless eyes
Perfect Warrior
I was falling into the boundless sea
I'm the sacred one who chose to change this world
Everything I hate to see...
Everyone I hate to hear...
Raise your sword and never fall again
I was calling, world never answered me
Time was standing still and life plunged into ruin
Everything I hate to see...
Everyone I hate to hear...
Hold your head up high and spread your words
Mob of "right", I despise your way of life!
I'm a "sinner", yet forgive me nothing
I'm a "heathen", but forever free
Remember!
If you try to break my wings
If you dare to watch my dreams
You'll forever bare your blame
In the name of pain
Remember!
If you try to break my wings
If you try to steal my dreams
You will never free your name
From the chains of pain
If you try to break my wings
If you dare to touch my dreams
Then my curse will be your pain
Denial Of Fate
Tribunal of senseless rabble
Built on fear and congruous prophecies
Twisting minds with planned hypocrisy
By the fools the clear're surrounded
Blind are deaf and deaf are blinded
Grant themselves the dream of destiny
Eternal path has not been "meant" for thee
The myth of fate you must tear by force
Get away!
Feel the taste of freedom, ride on wind
Let your mind see things world never seen
As you weed your life from the hope of fate
Find the way you shall within yourself
Clouds of might eclipse the horizon
Darkened sky as long as eye can see
Winds arise in wrath released by me
Now I spread the wings of fire
Flames of rage arise in power
The time has come to shed my burning will
Eternal path has not been "meant" for thee
The myth of fate you must tear by force
Get away!
Feel the taste of freedom, ride on wind
Let your mind see things world never seen
As you weed your life from the hope of fate
Find the way you shall within yourself
Feel the taste of freedom, ride on wind
Let your mind see things world never seen
As you weed your life from the hope of fate
Find the way you shall within yourself
Feel the taste of freedom, ride on wind
Let your mind see things world never seen
As you weed your life from the hope of fate
Find the way you shall within yourself
Welcome Back
Out of the sun, out of the night
Comes the morning light
Just another day breaks
Under the same sky
As the misty dawning fades away to its lair
Silence and peace fills the air
While this placid day reflects its calm
Feeling the chill of a distant zone
Hear the lost ones' cry from miles away
Wishing they were gone to another day
But the wishes give no hide
And the beasts you dread dwells in disguise
As the smoke covers my eyes
Mystic sight reveals
A doleful land among the shadows
Where only lost men go
Struggling in the night
Grief I see in their eyes
The sun is blackened while they fight
But the fire of hatred's rising high
The commands were only lies
Around me young men die
Welcome back, to the days of thunder!
Welcome back, to the days where you were born!
Welcome back, to break the spell you're under!
Welcome back, to the days of thunder!
Welcome back, to the days where you were born!
Welcome back, to raise again your honour!
What about the life...
that shined so bright once in your eyes?
What about the death... faith you lost...
so that was your quest?
What about the dreams...
there where no visions in your grief?
What about the fight...
that graced your life?
Water, fire, wind and soil
My soul came to be reborn
As the lightning thrashes black skies
The spirit fills my mind
Welcome back, to the days of thunder!
Welcome back, to the days where you were born!
Welcome back, to break the spell you're under!
Welcome back, to the days of thunder!
Welcome back, to the days where you were born!
Welcome back, to raise again your honour!
What about the life...
It shines so bright now in my eyes!
What about the death...
Faith I found, now life's my quest!
What about the dreams...
There're new visions in my grief!
What about the fight...
It graces my life!
Out of the fire
Out of the wind
Out of the water and soil
I'm reborn
The Kingdom Of My Will
Riding from wastelands
Black were their skies
My armour's still bleeding
Ripped by fire and ice
Watch the horseman wing out of the night
He's coming to save you, prepare! For now he arrives
Mounting through stormlands
With the wind in my hair
The spell I've broken...
...like the chains of despair
Share this flame that guides me in the dark
The spirit of metal, the legacy of our kind
To the kingdom of my will
From dungeons of emotions
Wisdom's voice is guiding me
Leads me through all tortures
Eyes of faith for me to see
The rotten deeds of liars
World that've turned to misery I brave
And the pure shall prevail
The misery I brave! Hey!
Led by that golden voice
Slaves of corruption
You'll fall by my hand
And all mindoppressors
Will be chased to the end
Fear the steel that's meant for all you rats!
The essence of insight, the truth,
that longs for your heads
To the kingdom of my will
From dungeons of emotions
Wisdom's voice is guiding me
Leads me through all tortures
Cross the life's unflagging sea
Through air I fly on thunder
Gift of force is meant for me
Refills my desolate shell
To the kingdom of my will
From dungeons of emotions
Wisdom's voice is guiding me
Leads me through all tortures
Forced to yield the hypocrites
But orders I'll not follow
Worms of lie surrounding me
Now see my wings of war!
The battle's confronting me
And for me... the battle has started again
Now see!
If you think I rest in wait
Until the fame will shine on me...
Through the mist I led myself!
The peak of dreams I reach by will!
Today is The Day!
Today is The Day!
Today is The Day!
Today is The Day!
Today is The Day!
Today is The Day!
Today is The Day!
Hey! You!
Hey!
If you think I rest in wait
Until the fame will shine on me...
Through the mist I led myself!
The peak of dreams I reach by will!
To the kingdom of my will
From dungeons of emotions
Wisdom's voice is guiding me
Leads me through all tortures
Cross the life's unflagging sea
Through air I fly on thunder
Gift of force is meant for me
Refills the chambers of my heart
On virgin soil serpents are born
Blind are their eyes, blinding's their bane
Feigned happiness real is as death
Hypocrites' plague infects the mind of man
There is that fear like a curse extending in veins
There is that torment that impairs thee
Roving in shadows
Yet with flame that glows in my heart
There on my way all alone, so alone, not alone
Only with eyes of a pure heart
Maybe some day you can see me
Faith be your guide when the sorrow encircles your self
Walking the path of a pure heart
Maybe someday you can meet me
Faith be your shine if the anguish eclipses your sight
Under the skin innocence breathes
Inherent grace, free from this waste
Insight and pain - sacred romance
Freedom not greed - a doubtless choice for me to make
There is a pureness that so real reveals in my dreams
There is a beauty that I long for
Covered by shadows, yet it's there so close in my sight
Waiting till shades are gone
Waiting till shades are gone...
Hailed shall be the ones who see what others can not
For no assumption I will waste my reason
The promised lands of sand are raised and troths build on tales
From heights I now behold the circus' credo
Solo: Equilibrian Epicurius
Solo: Trascendental Protagonist
Hailed shall be the ones who see what others can not
For no assumption I will waste my reason
The promised lands of sand are raised and troths build on tales
From heights I now behold the circus' credo
Only with eyes of a pure heart
Maybe some day you can see me
Faith be your guide when the sorrow encircles your self
Walking the path of a pure heart
Maybe someday you can meet me
Faith be your shine if the anguish eclipses your sight
Lost In The Depths Of Me
Down in the ashes wounded I crawl
Pray shall I not - god is gone
Lonely, but mighty, insight's my home
Into that shine now and again I will go
Stars gleam on my way, darkness chants for me
Into the depth I can see
Frozen, but conscious, spirit is my warmth
Wings of true will are carrying me through this world
But the world still is drowned in ecstasy
Of the fate and the myth of gods
But I doubt there's a journey planned for me
As I own every moment of my life
And the blessed they shall call it blasphemy
But I know what I think is right
Still the sun and the stars whill shine for me
For the pure I will fight
For no king I will die
For my thoughts I will live
Rambling in pain, drowning is sorrow, burning in hate
Why all this grief...
Chains not on me! I'm not a chosen one!!!
Fate for the mortals
Eyes for the searching ones
Don't dare you pray for me
When the faith is gone!
Lost in the depths of me
For the mind of the world I share my eyes
Truths' arms embrace these words
All the ones who lost their hope
Look deep in your ego - you'll find it there!
For the mind of the world
I share my breath
In mystic empathy
From the awe I healed my heart
And now as I tell this
I don't fear no more!
Rambling in pain, drowning is sorrow, burning in hate
Why all this grief...
Chains not on me! I'm not a chosen one!!!
Fate for the mortals
Eyes for the searching ones
Don't dare you pray for me
When the faith is gone!
Lost in the depths of me
Again Will The Fire Burn
Voices like wind...
Wordless their whispers...
I hear them!
Wandering alone, strayed form the path
Lost in the gales of despair
I see the shades wasting their last dreams
Hiding their woes... just for themselves
Only with fear as remains
Yet free you always can be
And dreams like ravens return
Some minds like diamonds survive
Again will the fire burn
Strain in the air...
Like crystal bells...
Now listen!
Deep in your mind search once again
Magical essence is there!
I brought my flame back from the shadows
Lost in the cold darks of this world
Will is the power I hail!
Yet free you always can be
And dreams like ravens return
Some minds like diamonds survive
Again will the fire burn
The Song Of Earth
Cry Of A Restless Soul
Hail to thee, Oh force of will
For awakening minds!
There for me from earliest days
Made this tale so mine
Storm...you almighty, earth, seas and flames
Here I am standing
Bare in my honesty
Calm in the moonshine
Starlight rests my eyes
Pain wakes me conscious
Truth guides my mind
Shine in my heart... strange colours embracing me
I'm not alone in a way
Wrath in my depths brings me to see I'm a warrior soul
Tortured minds... like a cloud they swarm around me
If I said my soul is screaming - would you believe in me!
Secret cry... hear the souls there howling, howling
While their salvation is so near
Deep inside it's always my time
All around it's only a world no one owns
Deep in heart it's always my time
Grief is nothing life should be
Never bend for misery!
Always standing
Always searching
Always free
Will is the power!
Strayed spirits before me, I see flames still burning
Hearts wounded, transformed
Yet not into grey, cold stones
Innocent days, life full of breath
That is the time I am crying for
Fly free again through virgin lands
That is the life I will fight for to regain
Turn around! All the founts you'll find behind you
If I said my heart is burning - would you believe in me!
Years flow by, still you drown is caustic memories
Embrace the best and face old grief
Deep inside it's always my time
All around it's only a world no one owns
Deep in heart it's always my time
Searching for a true relief
Finding life will be your first
Last one'll be your death
Cry of a restless soul
Hunting breeze of wasted bliss I am
For me and you I will catch it
In the dusk of banished mist you'll hear a waning moan
Cry of a restless soul
Think Not Forever
Waking up from a nameless decay
My life was is dream and my faith was in chains
Hypocrites kept me blind, still the Force is mine
Would it be in my heart to efface
Emotions for flesh and to stay out of doctrines' range
I am caught in a veil of illusions that haze my sight
If you think forever
Things will never change
When you find your sense again
You should follow its way
If you think forever
It is hard to see
When you find you truly believe
You should follow your spirit as your guide
Evolution in mind, heart and soul
Has brought me to see and to reach to my virgin glow
I have changed how to be, but it still is me
There is no one to stop my every strife
And all of my dreams now can be lived in life
I have learned how to see and believe in me, all time
If you think forever
Things will never change
When you find your sense again
You should follow its way
If you think forever
It is hard to see
When you find you truly believe
You should follow your spirit as your guide
Highlander (The One)
He's the one, pure in his heart
Shining fair in the bliss never lost
Noble grace, innocent faith
Running throughout the fields immense
Shouting free in the air again
Dancing there with the wind
Sudden gust hit my face, burning rain tore the clouds
From depth of the gloaming thunder came
On a mountain I saw it
When lightning reached out for him
Enchanting my eyes... in magical rhapsody
On a mountain I watched him
As power filled up his veins
Surrounded by dusk
As the rain from the heavens was falling, falling...
And lone he might be on the ways of this world
His sword, sole companion, always there
On a mountain I watched him
When proudly he swung his steel
Entracing my heart... in mystical harmony
On a mountain I saw it
When knowledge aroused his sense
Encircled by clouds
In the gales now enlightened reborn
Wish I could fly through the land beloved
Not in my dream, nor by spell then bound
Paradise's here in the fields immense
Here is my life, not above!
How could I leave this place...
Wish I could fly through the land beloved
Not in my dream, nor by spell then bound
Paradise's here in the fields immense
If I return to this world here I will live again
Straightened by fury, I feel no fear
Fire inside, it keeps me awake
For no blind I ever shall bend!
This is my law! This is my way!
Hey!
Insight's my power, truth is my breath
Free in my thoughts I always remain!
Choose to take a different path
Strong in the storms, pure through the waste
Stand up, Oh brothers over the world!
Enemies are there and mostly the same
We are a kind that never gives in!
We are a flame born in the wind!
Hey!
Time's of no matter, it never was!
World is the same, just different form
Freedom is something one doesn't earn
Always your own! Graced by the will!
He's the one, pure in his heart
Shining fair in the pride never lost
Noble grace, unbroken faith
Running throughout the fields immense
Shouting free in the air embraced
Dancing there with the wind
