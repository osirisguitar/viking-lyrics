The Forlorn Knight
Following Avon's crystal path
I pass'd by Warwick by chance
Where I came across a mansion
Standing gauntly on a low bluff...
He was brave and he was bold
He was in love with the daughter of his lord
She would not have him
She would not care
So he went afar to win her hand...
Germania's rose he set free
And put Saracens to the sword
He laid low monstrous beasts
Yet love he did not win...
He faced the Danes
And saved the day-King Athelstan
Did praise his name...
But bereft of love
He turned to god
And shut himself away from men...
Then I awoke and realized
I had slept in his death-bed...
The Purest Breed
Summer's breeze blowing through their mane
Wild horses of the purest breed! Ride!
Onward to battle, onwards like the wind
Cozak warriors of the purest breed! Hail!
Spurs to the side, a lash of the reins
Foam in the mouth, A' glistening the eye...
Bloodlust is nigh, for a rider and steed
Alike as they ride, pressing to the fight!
The banners are high and so's the battle cry,
The trampling of hooves of the purest breed! Ride!
Onwards to battle, onwards like the wind
Cozak warriors of the purest breed! Hail!
Spurs to the side, a lash of the reins
Foam in the mouth, A' glistening the eye...
Bloodlust is nigh, for a rider and steed
Alike as they ride, pressing to the fight!
Wild horses of the purest breed
Born to the steppes defiant to the cold
Cozak warriors of the purest breed
Loyal to the Czar, they defy death!
Summer's breeze blowing through their mane
wild horses of the purest breed! Ride!
Onward to battle, onwards like the wind
Cozak warriors of the purest breed! Hail!
Sleipnir
Sleipnir! Sleipnir!
O'er lofty mountains-Ride now!
Passing swiftly
Like a gust
Of deadly wind
A fate to seal
Son of Loki and Svadilfari
Take me where my brothers fell!
To Asbyrgi I'll make my stand
I'll fight and die upon your back!
Sleipnir!
Steed of Odin!
Hark!
The horn of Heimdall calls!
Lead the Gods to one last war
Against the Giants' fearsome host!
Over sea and through the air
To and fro the Underworld
Sleipnir! Sleipnir!
Rune-carved teeth bared in a neigh
That shakes the earth
And brings down the Thunder!
What Glory Remains
Oft I have seen
Many a brilliant star to fade
And night came creeping in to usurp that once shinning place... Long ago I was
a mariner
A viking conqueror... I sailed far with Erik the Red
And a hundred brave men!
What glory remains
Of these ancient days?
What songs will be sung
In the days to come?
Under hostile skies I have slept
On the heardrest of the sword
And dreamt of past glories long
Now gone forevermore...
I saw the fire that burns within
The mystic caverns of Thule
I journeyed to a world forlorn
Where shades weep forevermore...
Blackened by dragon's breath
Under arrows I have dreamt
Of the billows that caress
The shores of home again and again...
What glory remains
Of the ancient days?
What songs will be sung
in the days and years to come?
Alas!
I've grown too old
And my days are numbered...
I neither have the strength
Nor fire that I once did...
Dawn In Tir Na N'og
Clouds lined with silver
Soon to be parted
By the spear of lough
The dawn draws nigh... Tuatha de Danann
Awake! Seize the day!
A new sun doth rise
O'er Tir Na N'Og... sing me the song
My heart's yearning for
Play now the tune
That would bring me back
Back to your ring
There to dance with thee
And see the day break
In the otherworld!
Follow the sidhe through the lake
Icy waters flanked by hills so green
Unravel a path of mystical sheen
To undying lands let me now awake
Guardian at the gates
Of Tir Na N'Og
I fear now your sword!
Stand back, let me pass to the lands of my folk!
The Will Of Odin
Stars a glimmer in a valley sheer
Steel is drawn and shines in moonlight
The heavens quake then pour heavy rain
Thunders announce the bloody battle's eve...
The wheel of the sun is carved on my shield
And so are the runes of Thor on my sword!
Odin's blood has blessed my spear
Invincible I am
Dare stand in my path!
We crossed the sea in a dragon-ship
We braved the fury of the waves
We've come here for war, we bring woe
Fires that shall burn high and rise to the sky!
Odin ride forever by our side
Thy will is grim but it will be done!
Tyr embrace in thy might your sons
Freyja weave thy spell of magic...
The wheel of the sun is carved on my shield
And so are the runes of Thor on my sword!
Odin's blood has blessed my spear
Invincible I am
Dare stand in my path!
Father Of Victory
Father of victory
My life I lay down to thee
Steep me in majesty
And forth send thy Valkyries!
Father of victory
My sword I offered unto thee
Crown me for eternity
In Valhalla now welcome me!
Father of victory
Behold! Your true son am i
As einherjer I stand
In your honor for to fight!
Father of victory
Thou who reings supreme
Ride wild a hunting O'er fires on the battlefield
Charles Martel
Charles Martel, the day will come again
I'll see you lead the cavalry to charge!
Charles Martel, in the battle of Ambleve
You dyed Malmedy blood-red!
Tours recall the glory of your hosts
Thy fame is sung on harps with golden strings!
The crescent moon you drove back to the sea
Once and for all...
And when the sound of battle horns
Shall keenly fill the air anon
We'll rise with pride our banner high
And answer to our king's call!
Charles Martel, the day will come again
I'll see you lead the cavalry to chrage!
Charles Martel, in the battle of Ambleve
You dyed Malmedy blood-red!
Tours recall the glory of your hosts
Thy fame is sung on harps with golden strings!
The crescent moon you drove back to the sea
Once and for all...
Even when the horns of war
Shall echo in the fields no more
When in tatters hangs our flag
And empty be the throne of Franks
We'll still keep watch by night to see
Charles Marterl return again!
Rest now my king but light be thy sleep
Thy foes still covet thy crown...
Charles Martel, the day will come again
I'll see you lead the cavalry to chrage!
Charles Martel, in the battle of Ambleve
You dyed Malmedy blood-red!
Tours recall the glory of your hosts
Thy fame is sung on harps with golden strings!
The crescent moon you drove back to the sea
Once and for all...
Wallachian Warlord
The land beyond the forest
Where rusalky and domovye lurk
Is held under the spell
Of Vlad's sovereign stare...
Vampiric dusk now bleeds the sky
And the virgin dawn aghast will find
The boyar traitors impaled on a spike
In the shadow of Targoviste's spires...
Stand fast their hordes are come!
Bound to the dragon by oath of blood
Sword unsheathed, forth rode the rince
To drive the Ottoman wolves to the sea!
Broadswords of scimitars
The wild music of steel on steel
Yet Targoviste falls alas!
60000 dogs prowl the land
A curse on Corvinus, the sultan and Radu
Who thought that prison walls could keep a hero bound
In 1476 Wallachia welcomed backed her son
Placing on his shoulders the royal mantle of black legacy!
Stand fast their hordes are come!
Bound to the dragon by oath of blood
Sword unsheathed, forth rode the prince
To drive the Ottoman wolves to the sea!
The Iron Wolf
In the days of yore
The royal hunt was on
Loud bayed the hounds
As Gediminas set forth
In the holy woods
Of old Sventaragis
He laid down to rest
Beneath an ancient oak
And dreamt as only dream
The men who would be kings!
He saw the iron wolf
Ride monstrous on the hill
He heard the iron wolf
Howl like hundreds of it's kin!
Tearing from the veils of sleep
His heart was a wild drumbeat
He sought the counsel of the gods
Through Lizdeika's wise words:
"What is destined for thee, let it be!
Great Duke, unite thy people and be king!"
Fear not the iron wolf
He shall be thy fort!
And in him shall dwell
All the rulers of thy line
And the glory of their deeds
Shall resound like wolf-song
Thoughout the ancient world!
Heroes In The Sky
At last the flaming arrows
Fall like heavy rain upon me
And I am sailing towards
The vastness of the endless sky...
In Valhalla I will dine tonight
Like all heroes in the sky!
In my dreams, a Valkyrie
To take me to the sky!
There is no death tonight
I'm a hero in the sky!
Don't let my mother cry
I'm a hero in the sky
When the enemy spears
Formed lines full of thorns
I fell without a tear
I lived and died by the sword
In Valhalla I will dine tonight
Like all heroes in the sky!
In my dreams, a Valkyrie
To take me to the sky!
There is no death tonight
I'm a hero in the sky!
Don't let my mother cry
I'm a hero in the sky
Red on white across the vale
Blood on the snow is spilled
My battlecry did win the day
By my hand a king was killed!
In Valhalla I will dine tonight
Like all heroes in the sky!
In my dreams, a Valkyrie
To take me to the sky!
There is no death tonight
I'm a hero in the sky!
Don't let my mother cry
I'm a hero in the sky
Carmina Bellica
Upon the pinions of the wind
A call is carried forth
And sets our banners high
Fills our hearts with pride!
Swear the warrior's oath
On the shrine of the war-god
Carve runes upon your sword
And enemy hearts alike!
Songs of war signs my sword
Sound the charge we go to war!
Songs of war and glories old
Shall be rsung in our halls!
We stand beleaguered by foes and fire
Courage still in our eyes
Phalanx, hold the line!
Men of Hyperborea
Your time is come to ride
Lo! Your grim gods are aligned
Pon the ramparts of the sky!
Songs of war signs my sword
Sound the charge we go to war!
Songs of war and glories old
Shall be rsung in our halls!
"Show them Hyperborean might
O pride of the empire!
Today the field shall be thine
Bring them to their knees!
Crush their idols to the ground
Ride their armies down!
Let us take up the cry: Vae Victis!"
In An Emerald Garden
Come my love, we'll leave this here land-
I'll take you far by paths no mortal knows
In an emerald garden, under new-born stars
And there my love we could be as once before...
I'll make you a gown of lilies and pearls
To wear on the day we exchange vows
In an emerald garden, under an azure sky,
There my dear child we could love as before...
Warrior Heart
He who alone faces thousands,
He who stands when all kneel,
He who walks where few dare,
He whose voice speaks the truth...
Is a true man of honor,
A spirit unbowed;
And in his chest is a'pounding
A warrior's heart!
He who holds virtue sacred,
He who loves the Fatherland,
He who fights for his people,
He who surrenders to none...
Is a true man of honor,
A spirit unbowed;
And in his chest is a'pounding
A warrior's heart!
He whose soul has no price,
He whose eyes are not dark,
He whose sword brings justice,
He whose name is put to song...
Is a true man of honor,
A spirit unbowed;
And in his chest is a'pounding
A warrior's heart!

The Iron Wolf

Remember Hastings
No paler a star than Luna herself
Arose beside Venus when night settled in;
The eye of the heavens o'er Hastings beholds
The Norman and the Saxon lying side by side,
Drenched in red blood, still clinging to their swords,
They fought for the dominion of Albion's lands.
Yet who proved the strongest, hardly a man can tell;
Whose God prevailed? Christ or the Old Faith?
The days shall come, the nights shall pass
And the grass will grow on the mounds, alas!
The wind laments across Hastings' vale,
It still remembers the sound of swords being crossed,
The poignant yells the sound of fury, the fire and the blood!
And though centuries may pass,
And tall on Hastings grow the grass,
Remember that terrible day of swords,
Remember the warriors whose lives were lost-
Remember Hastings and shed a tear for it's ghost!

I'll see you lead the cavalry to charge!
Charles Martel, in the battle of Ambleve
You dyed Malmedy blood-red!
Tours recall the glory of your hosts
Thy fame is sung on harps with golden strings!

Shall keenly fill the air anon
We'll rise with pride our banner high
And answer to our king's call!

Thy foes still covet thy crown...

Homus Paganus
The cock crew in the morning,
I arose and went to the fields
Holding but a handful of seeds;
First I did sow then I did plough-
I prayed for rain to come down:
I prayed to Thor to burden the clouds
I looked up with hopes of a sky
Heavy, impregnated by a storm,
That would bring to life once more
My last handful of seeds;
I dreamt of the barely rich on the fields,
Would that I had a scythe
To reap all day long and then some more,
So as I could keep my storehouse filled
And put bread and ale upon my table...
Pray the Gods hear me,
Pray the wind bears my plea afar-
To the fields on high
Where immortals turn the soil
And blessings ripen like fruit
On the trees that guards vigilant
The fragrant orchards of Freyja...
(Intro) The Pipes Are Calling
Wolfsong In Moonlight (Fenris Unbound)
Child of atrocity - Progeny of Hel
Son of maiden fell;
Bound in dwarven chain
Helpless roar in rage!
Time for stars to fall
Ragnark's inaugural call!
Odin holds the prophecy scroll.
Release the beast!
Fimbul winter comes
Fires dying fast!
Wolf-song rides the gale
Frost whips with hail.
Release the beast!
Gluten maws in bloody feast
Horned Trolls And Mystical Folk
Horned trolls and mystical folk
Within the deep woods of twilight
Ethereal misty fingers entwine
Crooked boughs and mossy roots
Smell of the rain soaked ground.
Yet hark! What be this sound
Coming from afar?
Haunting tunes, the fairy song
They join in rings to dance
Plucking fiddles hewn of oak
Dwell in a citadel of fog
Horned trolls and mystical folk!
These horned trolls and mystical folk!
They dwell in the brooks
The dwell on the trees!
They live under rock,
They live by the sea!
Astride frogs and dragon flies
The travel far and wide
Mortal dreamers they invite
To their realm of ever light!
Perchance in thy strangest dremas
You glimpse fairies soynd asleep.
There by the creek.
Yet deeper still
They join in rings to dance
Plucking fiddles hewn of oak
Dwell in a citadel of fog
Horned trolls and mystical folk!
These horned trolls and mystical folk!
They dwell in the brooks
The dwell on the trees!
They live under rock,
They live by the sea!
Rhyming With Thunder
Great God of the storm, Ruler of the skies above,
Mighty ever-warrior Thor
Thy name we call
Descend to Midgard
Great God of the gloom,
We summon you!
Rhyming with thunder, chanter the holy Galder!
Modi, Thruder, Magni - Thor!
Master of the tempest, lord of wintry call,
Modi, Thruder, Magni - He is Thor, one and all!
Swing thy holy hammer
Warriors revel in the sight
With swords upraised
To hail the pouring rain
I greet thee chariot rider,
Frost giants bane!
Never fall, always uphold this battle hymn of old!
Mortal kinsmen die,
As crops wither and subside
Wealth is passing by.
Yet eternal remains a glorious deed's name!
A legacy of honor, legend for tomorrow!
For what glory warriors await
Once their heyday goes under
Save a skald's praise, rhyming with thunder?
Swing thy holy hammer
Warriors revel in the sight
With swords upraised
To hail the pouring rain
I greet thee chariot rider,
Frost giants bane!
Never fall, always uphold this battle hymn of old!
Rhyming with thunder, chanter the holy Galder!
Modi, Thruder, Magni - Thor!
Master of the tempest, lord of wintry call,
Modi, Thruder, Magni - He is Thor, one and all!
Eldritch Sorcery And Faery Runes
Spirit of the ash tree
Dweller in the oak, Thy realm I wish to traverse;
I whisper the ancient verse
Whisper the ancient verse
Passage safe to earn.
Gods of the earth,
You who made sylvan breath
Hear now my spells
Hear now my spells
As I flirt nightshade
In pagan forests primeval
Where dusk enthroned is king!
Once upon a day
On the wings of fairytale, Shamanic paths I take
Where in adoration
Wolves to the moon bay;
To the moon bay
Another figure I bcome
Inside the sylvan canvass
Hidden, away far from your world
I have ridden!
Spireless lands await me
In a world of elder magecraft
Elven runes engraved
Upon hyperborean skies
Like stars arrayed.
The man in black
There he awaits;
And there's no coming back!
Forest calling to mine ear
Distand echoes of the Dryad.
Enthralled I stand by this woodland melody.
Upon the altar of yew
Before Fangorn's palace
The Elven heart is beating;
Rhythm of my breathing
My hands lie bleeding
Dagger bitten grimly
An offering of life
To ethereal folk I sing.
An eerie moon beckons me
Gnarled boughs whistle
Attuned to a magic wind,
Call of elder arts I hearken!
Rings of stones, Idols of crows
Whilst primordial wonders stir the air
Trees lively welcome me
In this mystical realm
Of eldritch sorcery and Faery runes.
Faery runes...
In Odin's Court
"And Io, do I see my father
And Io, do I see my mother
And my sisters and my brothers
And the line of my people,
Back to the beginning...
And Io, they do call me,
In the halls of Valhalla
Where the brave may live forever!"
From death's embrace I awaken
Clutching the sword my life had taken;
Roofs thatched with gold
Songs of warriors old
In Odin's court
My eyes behold splendor untold!
What be this place?
What maiden brought my sould herein?
These are the halls
Of glorious Valhalla!
Step forth ye hammerheart,
Blessed champion of the Gods!
Heimdall will guard it
Vidar will welcome
In Odin's court our Einherjer brethren!
Come o beloved of the Raven,
Feast on flesh and mead;
Forever and all time
'Till Ragnarok arrives!
These are the halls
Of mighty Valhalla!
Heimdall will guard it
Vidar will welcome
In Odin's court
In Odin's court
I return to the ancient tree;
What was, shall forever be
Every nche resounds eternally
Warlike triumphant song
There in Odin's court!
Storm Ravens Come
Hammers of thunder temper a storm
Wailing the wonds descend from the North
Dragons awaken in their sanctums of frost
Three hundred berserkers strong
Sail a' Viking ere the break of dawn!
Plunder in the East
Raze village - burn monasteries
Wicked thralls of this pale Christ
"In our heart we know no fear
In our eyes swells no tear.
Should death we meet today
Let it be so...
Crowned in glory we shall fall!"
Storm Ravens sweep me away
Howl blood to the wintry sway
In Valhalla for me Odin shall await!
Call beyond the nigthly sky
The brave who lost their lives
Howl blood to the wintry sway
In Valhalla for me Odin shall await!
Feel the rage of the Aesir and die!
Storm Ravens come
With swords blessed by the Gods
Raging and furious
In battle they stand victorious
Twin ravens soaring high
Feel the rage of Aesir and die!
Storm Ravens come
Gaelic Valor
When the Moon still was young and the mountains were tall
In the realm of the Tuatha De Danann,
My delight was the sound of the hammer and forge
Shaping bronze into weapons of war.
When the Heroes of Dawn put the ginats to the sword
Strong was Cuchulain and shining was Lugh
They would sing to the wind with a falcon at their fist
Hymns of Gaelic valor.
I remember the day when their ships filled the sea
And the emblems of Rome hid the sky,
When the ninth legion marched to subdue the Red Queen
And the sons of the Goddes Danann.
The the Heroes of Dawn put the Romans to the sword
Strong like Cuchulain and shining like Lugh
They would fight skyclad, and to please the Morrigan
Die for Gaelic valor.
Now the Moon's in eclipse and the skies breed a storm
O'er the realm of the Tuatha de Danann
My lament shall be heard for the fires ashen cold
And the anvils resounding no more.
Now the Heroes of Dawn sleep in mounds underground
Cuchulain forgotten - forgotten is Lugh,
Who shall sing to the wind, shed his tears to fill the sea
For the lost Gaelic valor?
