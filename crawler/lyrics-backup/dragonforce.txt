1. Invocation Of Apocalyptic Evil
[Instrumental]

2. Valley Of The Damned
On a cold dark winter night hidden by the stormy light
A battle rages for the right for what will become
In the valley of the damned a warrior with sword in hand
Travels fast across the land for freedom he rides

And the sign from the master on high screams aloud and across hear the cry
For the kingdom of fire and ice and the power to be alive
Be strong ride on, carry on through the war
Come along carry on, living for ever more

On the wings of death by the hands of doom
By the darkest light from the darkest moon
Crossing silent seas over mountains high
For we stand as one tonight

On the black wind forever we ride on together
Destroying your evil with freedom our guide
When the master will storm us
He'll stand high before us
Our hearts filled with splendour
Our swords will shine over the light

In the valley of the damned
Days breaks with golden strand
Over pastures green it glows
To where night returns

In the shadows faces appear
Warriors wearing full metal gear
All join together one and all
Before the glorious light

Rise up, gather around
Come and hear what is said
Use your senses open your mind
Don't you ever forget

On the wings of life, by the hands of hope
By the brightest light from the brightest sun
Crossing silent seas over mountains high
To the valley of the damned

On the black wind forever we ride on together
Destroying your evil with freedom our guide
When the master will storm us
He'll stand high before us
Our hearts filled with splendour
Our swords will shine over the light

On the black wind forever we ride on together
Destroying your evil with freedom our guide
When the master will storm us
He'll stand high before us
Our hearts filled with splendour
Our swords will shine over the light

The black wind forever we ride on together
Destroying your evil with freedom our guide
When the master will storm us
He'll stand high before us
Our hearts filled with splendour
Our swords will shine over the light

The black...

3. Black Fire
We come from...
Over the dark horizon sky
With twisted tales of sacrifice
To imagine or believe all the glory of the free

Hunting all day an endless cry
The things I've seen I can't deny
Sinners, saints all mixed in one
The dawn of time has begun

Why can't you see what they're doing to me
Is it fair that I'm dying in vain

Once in a land of sacrifice now only valleys of demise
Shadows of a pale blue moonlight ride the waves of entity

Why can't you see what they're doing to thee
Is it fair that you all die in vain

Ride with the steel and the power of the sword
Stand up and fight now and forever more
Rise through the night sky with daylight's desire
To be free there must be black fire

Through the day and through the night with dragons heart the warrior strikes
This is the day that they'll be known as my enemy

Why can't you see what they're doing
To what we believe in we rise through the pain

Ride with the steel and the power of the sword
Stand up and fight now and forever more
Rise through the night sky with daylight's desire
To be free there must be black fire

We come from distant lands we travel so far
Can you see the bleeding scar
The prizes of life we fail to win
Cause we doubt the power within

Why can't you see what they're doing to
What we believe in we rise through the pain

Ride with the steel and the power of the sword
Stand up and fight now and forever more
Rise through the night sky with daylight's desire
To be free there must be black fire

Black fire...

4. Black Winter Night
Day after day as I bodies slay
And the sun becomes dark in the sky
Everything's lost for this human race
And the dawn of a new age will rise

Rays of sunlight now are gone
Only visions of ice will remain
The fallen ones and forgotten souls
Will rise up over the slain

No more hope as we raise our hands to the sky
No more dreams as the rivers run dry

Everything's lost all is left astray
Only sorrow and sadness remains
Curtains have dropped on our fallen world
And the forces of darkness shall rise

Why can't you see what has happened to thee
Can you not open your eyes
Everything's lost there is no retreat
And the valleys echo with pain

No more hope as we raise our hands to the sky
No more dreams as the rivers run dry

On the endless sea of madness we sail forever more
And the endless tears of sadness towards the distant shores
When the flame has died forever we stand one and all
With the power of the almighty sword

We fight the battle on the fields tonight
To save us from the master of all evil sign
And to the battle on forever standing strong
We feel the fire power of the night warriors

No more tomorrow
Dying of sorrow
Over the mountains and up through the trees
Traveling across seven seas

No more hope as we hold our hands to the sky
No more dreams as the rivers run dry

On the endless seas of madness we sail forever more
And the endless tears of sadness towards the distant shores
When the flame has died forever we stand one and all
With the power of the almighty sword

We fight the battle on the fields tonight
To save us from the master of all evil sign
And to the battle on forever standing strong
We feel the fire power of the night warriors

On the endless seas of madness we sail forever more
And the endless tears of sadness towards the distant shores
When the flame has died forever we stand one and all
With the power of the almighty sword

We'll fight the battle on the fields tonight
To save us from the master of all
We fight the battle on the fields tonight
To save us from the master of all evil sign

And to the battle on
Forever standing strong
We feel the fire
Power of the night warriors

The power of the night warriors...

5. Starfire
Outside on a winter's night as the rain begins to fall
There's a chill in the air and the howl of a wolf while the rain beats at the door
Seven kings will ride on the wind up towards the mountains high
And the only sound that will break the air is the warrior's bitter cry

When the dawn of a new day will see the light then the strongest hearts grow old
And the warrior stands on top of the hill in the snow

Dark night with a glimmering light in the distance up ahead
In the forest they dwell with a misty spell no one heard what once was said
And the eagle fly through the clouds while earth bleeds dark and cold
When the voices of men will ring out again all creation shall unfold

When the colour of night will fade to light and the weakest hearts go cold
And the warrior stands on top of the hill in the snow

And we're standing one and all fighting till we fall
Hoping for a better day never giving in
Until we find the words till we find the words to say
Until we find the words to say

Burning starfire shine in the sky
For the lives of great men who stand by your side
When the night fall on we will ride
For no lost souls will live on forever

Dark night on the valley below still the horsemen follow through
It's a forest that leads to the foot of the hill that inside the magic holds
Seven strong they ride on along to the place where sorrow lies
And the shadows of the night will no longer hide all their mysteries come undone

When the colour of night will fade to light and the weakest hearts go cold
And the warrior stands on top of the hill in the snow

And we're standing one and all fighting till we fall
Hoping for a better day never giving in
Until we find the words till we find the words to say
Until we find the words to say

Burning starfire shine in the sky
For the lives of great men who stand by your side
When the night fall on we will ride
For no lost souls will live on forever

And we're standing one and all fighting till we fall
Hoping for a better day never giving in
Until we find the words till we find the words to say
Until we find the words to say

Burning starfire shine in the sky
For the lives of great men who stand by your side
When the night fall on we will ride
For no lost souls will live on forever

For lost souls will live on forever...

6. Disciples Of Babylon
Can you imagine that it's all up to you
Evil embrace of powers unnatural
You're left in silence nothing more to behold
You close your eyes and visualize the day you'll get away

It's here
It's near
I see it all so clear
Tonight your flight will take you higher

It's here
It's near
You live a life of fear
Tonight is the night that will inspire

Crying alone at night your destiny unknown
You're every being full of rage and hate
Seems like you're running but you just can not hide
It's in a raging fear all solitude is left behind

It's here
It's near
I see it all so clear
Tonight your flight will take you higher

It's here
It's near
You live a life of fear
Tonight is the night that will inspire

Can he comfort thee and fill your life with ecstasy
Through the darkness and the pain
Will you be the ones again
Disciples of Babylon

It's here
It's near
I see it all so clear
Tonight your flight will take you higher

It's here
It's near
You live a life of fear
Tonight is the night that will inspire

Can he comfort thee and fill your life with ecstasy
Through the darkness and the pain
Will you be the ones again
Disciples of Babylon

It's here
It's near
I see it all so clear
Tonight your flight will take you higher

It's here
It's near
You live a life of fear
Tonight is the night that will inspire

Can he comfort thee and fill your life with ecstasy
Through the darkness and the pain
Will you be the ones again
Disciples of Babylon

7. Revelations
Coming down the mountain on high
Towards the battle we go side by side
Our hearts are filled with honour and pride
Cause we know our time has come

Silent voices down from below
Rising up through the ice and the snow
Ancient angers cast upon all
Through the land of the slain

Through the dark night through the rain
Fighting machine we are risen again
Striving forever more
We will survive

Stand and fight join the light
Into the battle with power and might
Sound the guns
Raise the cannons of war

With the north star to guide us we ride on the sky
Blazing up through the heavens like eagles we fly
And the horsemen shall come they will judge all your lives
Revelations will now be unveiled

Darkened night set to swallow the light
All is lost there's no one left to fight
Overpowered by the glory and might
Of the ones who stand tall

Fallen heroes scattered around
Deafened ears opens up to the sound
Painful cries rising forever more
Through the victims of life and of war

Through the dark night through the rain
Fighting machine we are risen again
Striving forever more
We will survive

Stand and fight join the light
Into the battle with power and might
Sound the guns
Raise the cannons of war

With the north star to guide us we ride on the sky
Blazing up through the heavens like eagles we fly
And the horsemen shall come they will judge all your lives
Revelations will now be unveiled

No more hope of freedom
Our dreams are washed away
The second age is coming
It's the dawn of a new day

Judgement stands before us
The second king will rise
Our swords will shine with honour
Hatred fills the sky

Hatred fills the sky...

With the north star to guide us we ride on the sky
Blazing up through the heavens like eagles we fly
And the horsemen shall come they will judge all your lives
Revelations will now be

With the north star to guide us we ride on the sky
Blazing up through the heavens like eagles we fly
And the horsemen shall come they will judge all your lives
Revelations will now

Revelations will now
Revelations will now be unveiled

8. Evening Star
[Music: Herman Li, lyrics: Herman Li, ZP Theart]

We will sail on
Forever on
To the land of the evening star

Into the endless we ride
Unveil the darkness behind
Abandoned glory hidden
Castaway we ride

Now will the sky surrender
Forever through the never
A silent whisper echoes
Through my restless heart tonight

I will see glory rise
We'll be one tonight

Don't you shut your eyes in silence
Tonight gather near
Come and live your fear

In a land of desire
Your heart filled with fire
You live for the right to be free
We will sail on
Forever on
To the land of the evening star

In a land of desire
Your heart filled with fire
The land of the evening star

Now and forever after
Asylums filled with laughter
Suspicion haunts my dreams
An echo through my mind

This starlit gaze reminds me
Are you so blind you can't see?
The winds of change, my friend,
Will blow for you in the dead of nights

I will see glory rise
We'll be one tonight

Don't you shut your eyes in silence
Tonight gather near
Come and live your fear

In a land of desire
Your heart filled with fire
You live for the right to be free
We will sail on,
Forever on
To the land of the evening star

In a land of desire
Your heart filled with fire
The land of the evening star

[Solos: Herman, Sam, Herman and Vadim, Herman, Vadim and Sam, Herman]

In a land of desire
Your heart filled with fire
You live for the right to be free
We will sail on
Forever on
To the land of the evening star

In a land of desire
Your heart filled with fire
The land of the evening star

9. Heart Of The Dragon
Proud and so glorious standing before of us
Our swords will shine bright in the sky
When united we come to the land of the sun
With the heart of a dragon we ride

We are flying on wings in winter sky with fire burning deep inside
We are warriors of endless time forever and on
On wings of steel an ancient flight we see the powers that unite
The gods will now send us a sign of battle once more

Through the valley we ride full of glory we soar
Where the fights will be raging for now and for more
When united we come and divided they fall
Tonight you will witness it all

Proud and so glorious standing before of us
Our swords will shine bright in the sky
When united we come to the land of the sun
With the heart of a dragon we ride

A land unknown we come so far
We ride the night till morning star
When colours fade to black and white
Your eyes come to sight

With the vision of a great divide
You turn towards the other side
You think you run but you can't hide
The dead can not ride

Through the valley we ride full of glory we soar
Where the fights will be raging for now and for more
When united we come and divided they fall
Tonight you will witness it all

Proud and so glorious standing before of us
Our swords will shine bright in the sky
When united we come to the land of the sun
With the heart of a dragon we ride

Over high seas and mountains
We fly to the heavens on wings of a dragon tonight

Proud and so glorious standing before of us
Our swords will shine bright in the sky

Proud and so glorious standing before of us
Our swords will shine bright in the sky
When united we come to the land of the sun
With the heart of a dragon

The heart of a dragon
The heart of a dragon we ride

10. Where Dragons Rule
[Bonus Track]

Full the moon and midnight sky
Through the dark they ride
Warriors of forever will sacrifice the night

One for all and all for one
The future time has come
Faces filled with torment
Your heart beats like a drum

Never you will surrender
You'll fight on 'til the end
Together we will be strong again
Forever...

In this land we have defended from all things dark and cruel
Now we are defenseless in a land where dragons rule

In this land we have defended from all things dark and cruel
Now we are defenseless in a land where dragons rule

Flash of steel in the mid-day sun
The battle has begun
Blood spills all around us but still we carry on

No mercy we will show to them
The white flag shall be raised
We'll fight for our freedom
Ride towards this evil place

We all stand until the end allegiance to this game

In this land we've defended from all things dark and cruel
Now we're defenseless in a land where dragons rule

In this land we've defended from all things dark and cruel
Now we're defenseless in a land where dragons rule

Sun set in the western sky
The battle's almost done
The victory will be glorious
Our enemies are gone

We all stand until the end allegiance to this game

In this land we've defended from all things dark and cruel
Now we're defenseless in a land where dragons rule

In this land we've defended from all things dark and cruel
Now we're defenseless in a land where dragons rule

[Solo]

In this land we've defended from all things dark and cruel
Now we're defenseless in a land where dragons rule [3x]

Asylums filled with laughter
Suspicion haunts my dreams
An echo through my mind

You exit through a dark hole
Re-entry feels essential
The link between two worlds
So suitable, the darkest night

I will see glory rise
We'll be one tonight

Don't you shut your eyes in silence
Tonight gather near
Come and live your fear

1. Heroes Of Our Time
Lost in a dream, finally it seems,
Emptiness and everlasting madness,
See the sadness grow, watching as we know,
Long before our journey for the world,
Call for us, the power in all of us,
So far beyond the blackened sky tonight...
Glorious, forever more in us,
We are victorious, and so alive.

[Chorus]
We'll all find our sacrifice tomorrow,
Our journey on towards a brighter day,
Silent tears we left behind, still so far away,
Across the endless sands,
Through the fields of our despair,
Free for all eternity, we stand, yeah,
Rise above the universe tonight,
Starchaser...

Fly towards the storm, see the world reborn,
Feel the pain inside the voice of sorrow,
Cross the distant shores, find the open door,
Stand alone, in judgment for tomorrow.

Years of pain still haunt us all, we saw the last sunrise,
Take me home, in freedom, for a lifetime...
Pray now for the silence, and the last tears we'll cry
So glorious, this fire inside, united we stand.

[Chorus]
And we'll all find our sacrifice tomorrow,
Our journey on towards a brighter day,
Silent tears we left behind, still so far away,
Across the endless sands,
Through the fields of our despair,
Free for all eternity, we stand, yeah,
Rise above the universe tonight,
Starchaser...

Free from this world, here for the last time,
Oceans collide inside of us all,
Believe who we are,
The phoenix will guide us,
Freedom will rise once again.

Save us tonight, the last hope for all of us,
Light-years gone by, we're still holding on,
Save us tonight, a star shines in all of us,
Far beyond our lives, still our glory lives on.

[Chorus]
And we'll all find our sacrifice tomorrow,
Our journey on towards a brighter day,
Silent tears we left behind, still so far away,
Across the endless sands,
Through the fields of our despair,
Free for all eternity, we stand, yeah,
Rise above the universe tonight,
Starchaser...Starchaser...

Our kingdom come, we stand as one,
And we will live for always evermore...

2. The Fire Still Burns
Finally all the world will see,
Rise again before the endless silence,
Burn the soul before we'll all be free,
Light the path beneath a blackened, burning sky.

One final sacrifice, this night belongs to me,
Turn back before the dawn of winter,
So far away the cry set fallen angels free,
Through my mind tonight, our journey ever after.

Never ending solitude, this is your life to be,
So cold and dark, the voice of sadness,
Suffering in endless pain, the truth of all to be,
Crawling back to life through ever-blinding darkness.

Free falling, fates warning, find a life to hold on,
Souls stealers, true believers, rise now they are gone,
And as they ride away forsake the one to save us,
Winters mourning of a lost fallen world,
Pray now united in a lifetime alone,
Won't you wait for the silence so strong?
Wait for the dawn.

[Chorus:]
Tonight, falling like the rain insanity lives on,
Feel the shattered dreams, one thousand voices crying,
Raging endlessly they come, whoa,
And the morning light will hide the darker days gone by,
And the sun will shine again across the blazing skies,
Glorious eternally we'll rise above the world,
Marching on till victory we fight,
The fire still burns...

Looking back our passing lives, their memories to see,
Flick through the passages of silence,
Hidden by the sacrifice to set the demons free,
Now they understand reclaim the land relentless.

Fear calling, transforming, stand alone in our time,
Advocation, desolation, slay the vision divine,
And all the stars fall around the world tonight,
Silent forces from a past life return,
Pray for the silence in a world so alone,
Til' we touch the horizon beyond,
Fly through the storm.

[Chorus]

The tears in your eyes,
A lifetime of misery,
In silence we stand all alone for the fate of our own destiny,
A lifetime of lies,
One chance at this fantasy,
The judgement will pass for the cries of the world that has faded from me.

Whoa, oh oh oh,
Whoa, oh oh oh,
Whoa, oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh ohhh,
Whoa, oh oh oh,
Whoa, oh oh oh,
Whoa, oh oh oh oh oh ohhhh oh oh oh.

[Chorus]

3. Reasons To Live
Once again I'm here alone, my secret life awaits me,
Still a thousand miles away from a land of broken dreams,
Night falls and the screen is shining, force deception behind the lines,
Hours wasted aimlessly gone, time and time again.

[Pre-chorus:]
Try to understand, desperately lost with a dream in my hand,
Will you wait alone for me tonight?
Hold me, save me.

[Chorus:]
A star shines in all of us, we'll search for all our lives,
One day we'll find a way, and a reason to survive,
Cry for the day to return, life no one can understand,
We all face our fears in the world,
We all hold our place in the universe,
For eternity...

Hide the lines deceive myself, erase the past from my space,
Images of loneliness sent far across the land,
Once sure, but my eyes are blinded,
Frantic charge for a place to hide
Lost generations apart, an ancient life returns.

Kindness in her eyes, taken away by a man in disguise,
Won't you wait alone again tonight?
Save me, take me.

[Chorus]

[Pre-chorus]

A star shines in all of us, we'll search for all our lives,
One day we'll find a way, and a reason to survive,
Cry for the day to return, life no one can understand,

Our past lives return to us all.
Our memories will fly free forever.
So far from the cries of the world for eternity.

4. Heartbreak Armageddon
Highway of emptiness outside the burning world,
Rise again this quest for our salvation,
Running faster, the savage laughter, the daylight fades away,
Nothing left but the life we left behind,
Ever searching the hidden faces, the hatred grows inside,
Broken man and a family left destroyed.

Light years away, empty words between us,
So turn away and say goodbye for the last time tonight,
Still lost within the loneliness a lifetime ago,
Hanging on as we passed through the fields,
These pieces of our lives will lead the long journey home,
And the wounds never heal

[Chorus:]
So fly for the last time, and the fire burns within,
Silently we stand in a long forgotten wasteland,
Rise through the lost ages, hope they will bring,
Free forever more and the dream will never die.

Devastation, a lost connection, a beatdown man returns,
So confused and alone for one more time,
Crushed defeated, the fog surrounding, a prisoner trapped inside,
System down feel the veins erupt tonight.

Time after time, promises of freedom,
We'll leave the past behind and strike for the first time tonight,
Still mystified by lack of cravation they show,
After all of the trials we've been through,
These memories and empty words were all lost in vain,
And the scars never heal.

[Chorus 3x]

Whoa, oh, oh,
And the dream will never die.

5. The Last Journey Home
Strangers to reason, our bleeding hearts so cold,
Life brings a change in season, fear will blind the soul,
In the silence one moment alone,
Cast away scattered far on the wasteland.

Sever the soul from the forgotten sickness, escape this life,
Challenge the dream before the long departed a mindless rhyme,
Whoa, oh, oh,
Hear the burning thunder roar,
Whoa, oh, oh, oh, oh, ohhh.

Whoa, oh, oh,
Still lost in a fire storm,
Tonight we feel the past return.

Lost inside the dream, pass by the life we'll live forever,
Still the wasted time left burning below
One thousand shattered voices, lost inside in endless wonder,
Tonight her voice will take me home.

[Chorus:]
Shine glorious we run, we stare into the blackened sky,
Save the last command, the virtue blinding,
So far beyond the sun, still burning with the fire inside,
Once alone again, silent stares for our last journey home.

Paralysed, intensified mutation, frustration,
Everlasting lifetime in the underworld,
We'll travel endlessly, deluded, disjointed,
One man can't understand this sad misery.

Whoa, oh oh oh ohh,
Whoa, oh oh ohh,
Whoa, oh oh oh oh oh ohh.

They've taken my heart,
They've taken my soul,
And now we stand alone insanity.

In time we'll see the past unwind,
Alive, still wandering our fallen land,
One more time we stare into the blackened sky,
For tonight, in our hearts now we feel,
One last time see our destiny revealed.

[Chorus]

Shine glorious tonight, still blinded by the blackened sun,
Save the last command, forever rising,
So far beyond they come, still burning with the fire inside,
Once alone again, silent stares for our last journey home.

6. A Flame For Freedom
[Chorus:]
One dream in all of us still shining,
One star, the ever-lasting light,
So alone, so lost inside, to the end in paradise,
United, victorious, the hearts of our nation tonight.

In the dark December morning light,
Fall strong to the burning winds, the fires of Hell will forsake me,
Shattering the chains that ever bind us,
Suffering their pain eternally.

Four strong, smash the silence, carry on like before,
Fires burn, still we battle, lost so far away,
Storm with hell fire raging, sun shines down as they kneel,
Lost in times and long forgotten, gathering miles away.

Tears fall inside the dream, our last days gone by,
Still alive we feel the pain tonight,
Stars fall through blackened clouds, in dreams sadness reigns,
A twilight star in the thousand lights for me.

Ohhhhhhhhh.

[Chorus]

And still we save a breath for the world,
Life brings up for us all,
United, victorious, the hearts of our nation tonight.

One dream in all of us still shining,
One star, the ever lasting light...

[Chorus]

And still we save a breath for the world,
Life brings up for us all,
United, victorious, the hearts of our nation tonight.

United, victorious, the hearts of our nation tonight.

7. Inside The Winter Storm
Strangers they come with the rise of the sun,
To escape from this madness forever,
Rivers will dry, bringing holes in the sky,
As the empire is fading away.

Silently march now, where the lost souls run wild,
In a time long forgotten, forever,
Pain brings us sadness at the dawn of the world,
But this nightmare will still carry on.

Through the day we'll find a way, we're lost beneath the stars,
Faceless they fall now, and we all stand as one,
Long wasted tears, but a light forever shining,
One stand one last demand to end it all.

[Pre chorus:]
Outside the world in a fallen land, turn away from our despair,
We stand alone in a silent dream, lost within eternally,
Whoa, oh oh ohh,
Whoa, oh oh oh ohh,
Rise again and try to understand.

[Chorus:]
A light for the world will save us tonight,
Redemption still so far away,
Marching on inside of our loneliness,
Still searching for all that remains.

And time will pass me by,
But I'm not so far away,
We're the sons of the land, our lifeblood runs into the ocean,
Tomorrow we're gone, our souls rising up to the sun.

[Chorus]

It's just one wasted man in one wasted land,
Suffering, still burning, so alive,
It's just one wasted man, in one wasted land,
Until the end of time,
Inside the winter storm.

[Pre chorus]

[Chorus]

It's just one wasted man, in one wasted land,
Suffering so far, and so alive,
It's just one wasted man, in one wasted land,
Until the end of time,
Inside the winter storm.

Inside the winter storm !

8. The Warrior Inside
Sonic fires bring mass devastation,
Manic search in sad desperation,
Jeopardise the right to hide from a sad existence,
Nothing left, still searching for something,
Deep beneath the cries
Wait for the deafening silence, fly forever more.

Crushed by the thought that you're all alone, cravation in her eyes,
I will be waiting tomorrow,
Striving to understand, wasting a life not meant to be,
Twisted and so broken once again,
And the promises we cast away will shine a guiding light,
Victim of your grief and denial.

[Chorus:]
Take my hand, this one last time,
Face the world before us, the warrior inside,
In a lifetime of disaster, it's a battle to the end,
Final stand, my life must carry on,
And forever, this time.

Battered, beaten, forced to submission,
Stricken by your fatal decision,
Suddenly it's time to say your last goodbyes,
Misery remains voluntary, all illusion gone,
Break through the blistering madness,
Free forever more.

Blinded my eyes with your filtering mutation cast aside,
I'll still be waiting tomorrow,
Stand to a toxic man, forced to a life of yesterday,
Theatre of salvation crushed and burned,
Down this lonely road, recede the day our dreams are brushed,
Can't regain this emptiness in time.

[Chorus]

See through the skies,
Far beyond the road tonight,
Here the sounds of freedom ring,
In a silent dream, and a million miles away.

See through the skies, far beyond our world tonight,
Hear the sounds of freedom ring,
In a silent dream,
And a million miles away.

Reach for the stars,
And live our lives forever free,
In our hearts for a thousand years,
And a thousand lifetimes before.

And the dawn of a new day will rise, a light for us all.

9. Strike Of The Ninja
[Special Edition Bonus Track]Eternal temptation, their eyes to the sky
This nightmare is everywhere, my eyes open wide
Crash on through troubled waters, oceans collide
We stand alone until the end, we fight side by side

Standing strong together, marching forever on
Fire in the heavens, now that our time has come

We feel the fire burning bright in the night
Where the warrior lives and the warrior dies
Wherever you go, we will be by your side
For the Spirit of Ninja will carry the night

The sky will turn black as nightfall appears
The hatred surrounding, they hide in great fear
The evil all around, the sound they will hear
Will not be for long now, the time it is near

Raising hell forever, still millenniums go by
Fire in the heavens, bleeding ears hear the cry

We feel the fire burning bright in the night
Where the warrior lives and the warrior dies
Wherever you go, we will be by your side
For the Spirit of Ninja will carry the night

Standing strong together, marching forever on
Fire in the heavens, now that our time has come

We feel the fire burning bright in the night
Where the warrior lives and the warrior dies
Wherever you go, we will be by your side
For the Spirit of Ninja tonight

We feel the fire burning bright in the night
Where the warrior lives and the warrior dies
Wherever you go, we will be by your side
For the Spirit of Ninja will carry the night

With the ninja forever, tonight!

10. Scars Of Yesterday
[Special Edition Bonus Track]Suffer the raging anger creeping below
Trapped in the circle, so helpless
Forces beyond
This is your last chance to die

I hear a thousand voices screaming my name
Dreams of a life forgotten now will be gone
Never to return again

Hide from the light, you feel so hypnotized
Filtered and disguised
Burning forever, try to remember
Sadness in her eyes

So many times now we've been here before
No more illusions behind the open door
Trapped within my fierce desire, resistance is futile
Screaming for your life, nowhere to hide
Tonight we cross the line, your innocence is mine

Falling down, my life fading now to the end
One last chance of glory in my heart again
Set me free from craving the one thing I can't have inside of me
But is it all a waste of time?

Lost in a misery, the fatal demise
Forced to a living that no one can understand
Hiding behind all the lies

A long time in slavery, it cries out in vain
Lurking around the shadows until the end
Fearless in fatal disguise

Wake from the dream, the life you left behind
Time to understand
Lost in the laughter, life everafter
Trials of a broken man

And through this madness a new day will rise
We shall remember the pain she held inside
Fear the pain inside my heart, our sacrifice in vain
Screaming for your life, nowhere to hide
This everlasting strain, driving you insane

Falling down, my life fading now to the end
One last chance of glory in my heart again
Set me free from craving the one thing I can't have inside of me
But is it all a waste of time?

Still lost in the universe, we cry for a new day to come
Break free from our loneliness, the last time
Pray tonight as we try to understand

Falling down, my life fading now to the end
I'm alive forever, my soul will ascend
One last chance of glory in my heart again
Set me free from this craving the one thing I can't have inside of me
Just a memory
Or is it all a waste of time?

11. E. P. M. (Extreme Power Metal)
[Japanese Bonus Track]In a lifetime of decay
Sudden cry for yesterday,
When the world will see the end of eternity
Sacrifice before the dawn
Of a child soon to be born
Before the night too many tears we cried

In a long forgotten land
Through the silent raging pain
Of the price to pay that awaits for me
The end of all our destiny

Don't close your eyes tonight
For the lights beyond still shine towards a brighter day
The time has come for us tread blood across the sands
Carry on as the red rivers run

And through the wilderness we feel the pouring rain
In the silence ever searching on through the misery
And all the promises we made and cried in vain
Don't you take the time to realise the master of disguise?

Blind my eyes burning forever to wash my sins away
Out of the dark pain is the price
Fly away out of the raging storm
Lost within my memories
Still haunting me
A never ending story

Far and wide forever on
Stand before the world alone we journey to the other side
Raise your hands to the sky
Through the night and through the day
Don't look back no time to pray
The battle rages on marching on and on

Don't cry for me tonight
For the lights beyond will guide me home tomorrow
The time will come for us the curse is growing strong
Carry on with the rise of the sun

So take me far away it's time to set me free
All my life I have been waiting but I could never see
Raising your hands to the sky
Turning your eyes to the sun
Pray for forgiveness
The power to save has gone for the last time

Blind my eyes burning forever to wash my sins away
Out of the dark pain is the price
Fly away out of the raging storm
Lost within my memories
Still haunting me
A never ending story

Blind my eyes burning forever to wash my sins away
Out of the dark pain is the price
Fly away out of the raging storm
Lost within my memories
Still haunting me
A never ending story

1. My Spirit Will Go On
[Music: Sam Totman, Lyrics: ZP Theart, Sam Totman]

Life is a misery, don't know how it's come to be
Death, the epitome of all of our days
In the past we had no choice to hear or to be the voice
Close your eyes and visualize the demon to arise

You know that sanity is not as it was meant to be
And now that misery has taken a new stand
In the land of a thousand souls we will carry on through the rain
In the sun we will move along with the memories of the slain
When I see this humanity and the evil that they have come to be
We've come to the point of no return and you beg for just...

One more time to escape from all this madness
One more time to be set free from all this sadness
And one last time to be the one who understands
My soul and my spirit will go on, for all of eternity

Foreign the currency, your payment in blood to be
Death is the destiny for all of our ways
In the dark you hide away for who or what you can't say
When I see the power of the demon come alive

You know that sanity is not as it was meant to be
And now that misery has taken a new stand
On the wings of eagles flying staring on to the sun
Reaching for the gold horizon when the war shall be won
Can you see the debauchery and the blade of death that has come for thee
In winds of torment forever more you will cry for just...

One more time to escape from all this madness...

[Solos - Sam / Herman / Sam / Herman / Twin Blast / Sam / Twin Blast / Sam]

2. Fury Of The Storm
[Music / Lyrics: Sam Totman]

We are riding for the battle field in force tonight
Fury of the darkest evil cry for war
Far beyond the boundaries of hell and starlight
On the road to lands unknown forever more

Through the caverns far below our quest will lead us
Onwards through the ice and snow forever more
Standing fighting full of hate the time has come now
Stand and sound the guns of glory cry for war

On wings of glory we will carry on
Far across the forgotten lands toward the distant sun
And in the darkness shining far beyond the starlight
Lightning is striking from the dark dawning shadows
And in the kingdom of the everlasting sun
When the glory of the master's time has come

Into the fires of forever we will fly through the heavens
With the power of the universe we stand strong together
Through the force of power, it will soon reach the hour
For victory we ride, Fury of the Storm!

We are the chosen ones we cannot fail now
Spilling all the blood on the fires below
Smashing through the boundaries with the fire and fury
Killing all the mortals down the winding road

Hell fires are raging the storm growing strong
On the path to victory towards the distant sun
And in the darkness shining far beyond the starlight
Lightning is striking from the dark dawning shadows
And in the kingdom of the everlasting sun
When the glory of the master's time has come

Into the fires of forever we will fly through the heavens
With the power of the universe we stand strong together
Trough the forced of power, it will soon reach the hour
For victory we ride, Fury of the Storm!

3. Fields Of Despair
[Music: Herman Li, Sam Totman, Lyrics: Herman Li, Sam Totman]

Can you feel the pain inside sometimes in my mind?
In the land of loneliness the seas of blood run cold
Is the feeling lost inside within the sins of all mankind?
Time after time we stood united on we go

Fly far away don't let the world pass you by
Live for the day when we must stand and survive
Now we face the judgment day our souls will feel the pain
Hear the screams of my world through the rain

Silent fields of despair my tears in the rain
Pain in my heart bleeding through
One day we'll be back for one moment in time
Endlessly searching for you...

Who can cure my emptiness inside for this time?
Suffering from loneliness my dreams and hopes will die
No more feelings left inside my blackened heart I cannot hide
Time after time our souls divided on we cry

Fly far away don't leave your own past behind
Live for the day another year passes by
Now we turn to face our fear there's nothing more to say
Still your dreams and my nightmares remain

Silent fields of despair my tears in the rain...

[Solos - Vadim / Sam / Vadim / Sam & Herman / Herman]

4. Dawn Over A New World
[Music / Lyrics: Sam Totman]

In the darkness of the night in the shadows of the dawn
It's turning black no looking back the sands of time are sown
When the day will slowly end and the sun has turned to grey
Will we feel the power of freedom with the dawn of a new day?

Over mountains paved with gold and through the valleys of the slain
Our quest will lead us onwards to the journey of the brave
When the time has come to stand for the power we believe
We will ring the sound of victory for one and all to see

Sometimes in your darkest dreams you will feel the haunting pain
Silent tears of your hidden fears come to haunt you once again
Fight on for the memories of the everlasting dream
Their in the silent lands on wings of glory free
We can go on forever with the darkness so far away
And the warriors who live forever fight on to the end

Across the highest mountains and through the endless seas
Our journey ever onwards fight until we all be free
Through the darkness shining the never ending light
On through the days of glory rise towards the fight

And one day we will find a way toward this distant golden age
The cries of war will sound the day
We stand before the dawn of a new world

On through the raging thunder across the seven seas
Cold winter skies are falling on the battles we have seen

[Solos - Herman / Sam]

We can go on forever with the darkness so far away
And the warriors who live forever fight on to the end

Across the highest mountains and through the endless seas...

5. Above The Winter Moonlight
[Music: Vadim Pruzhanov, Lyrics: Vadim Pruzhanov, Sam Totman, Herman Li, ZP Theart]

On wings of burning fire across the oceans far
The legends of the seven seas and mystic fallen star
Their laden ships are sailing on towards the sun
To the island of the everlasting chosen one

Face our fear along the way our freedom will prevail
The crown and the shining light
Punishment and anger in the fire of your soul
Prepare the eternal fight

Lost in a dream in a boundless sea
Rivers of pain are guiding me
Defending this land from the sins of man
Never surrender our dreams again

Ride forever onwards stare into the sun
Where hopes and dreams are everlasting marching on and on
Rise another day across the distant skies
Where the dawn above the winter moonlight shines upon the fall of our lives

Insanity sublime shall make by bleeding heart
Feel cold and fearless anger rising far beyond the dark
In search of might and wisdom sacrifice our souls
In the name of truth and justice never to be told

Face our fear along the way our freedom will prevail
The crown and the shining light
Punishment and anger in the fire of your soul
Prepare the eternal fight
Can you not feel the eternal pain
Flows through your heart and every vein
The torture begins and it breaks you down
Nothing to save when the soul is gone

Ride forever onwards stare into the sun...

[Solos - Herman / Sam / Herman / Sam]

6. Soldiers Of The Wasteland
[Music: Sam Totman, Lyrics: ZP Theart, Sam Totaman]

Burning fires, burning lives
On the long distant roads
Through the lost mountains endless
So far away from home

Crossing battles savage seas towards the mountains high
Forest plains of wilderness we're striking out tonight
On towards our destiny we travel far and wide
Journey through the darkness as your hearts refuse to die

In the flames of hell we fire at will the fires of doom has come
With the forces of the blackest knights they're staring at the sun
Far across the distant plains of ice we're searching for the sword
When the time has come for the battle now we follow with the horde

We will ride with fire burning hot towards the night sky
In the land of long ago forever in our souls
Fly on wings of shining steel are burning so bright
In ancient lands of warriors we're riding on again

Burning fires burning lives on the long distant roads
Through the lost mountains endless so far away from home
Warrior soldiers forever we fought long ago
We're all lost in the darkness so far away from home

Fallen soldiers taste the steel of death the daylight dawning
Sun will shine upon the lives of burning hearts of ice
As you break through the boundaries of life this feeling of despair
And they die in their sleep for the world that will not care
You feel lost in this labyrinth of pain this sickening dismay
There's a voice inside that's calling another wasted day

Can't you see the history the suffocating madness
In the land of fallen souls there's nowhere left no place to go
I have traveled far and wide across the wasteland
Still searching for the answers for the right to understand

Burning fires burning lives on the long distant roads...

Riding through the starlight and smashing the boundaries as hellfire falls from the sky
A shadow of pain will arise from the ashes of those fallen ones who have died
Our only master with fire and fury of hell will see his bidding done
Blasting from high as the battle unfolds to the gates of the city we come

[Solos - Twin Blast / Sam / Herman / Herman / Herman / Vadim / Sam / Herman / Sam / Vadim / Herman / Herman / Herman, Sam & Vadim]

7. Prepare For War
[Music: Herman Li, Lyrics: Herman Li, ZP Thearth]

I hear a distant thunder
They say bow down surrender
Witnessing our demise and the sins of our land
Why can't we see from under?
Dark reign of our defenders
Endlessly torturing the souls without stand

Fight now let's break the chains
So strong we must feel the pain
Forever torn apart from the haunting hears of my heart

Rage and fear from skies above the fire fuels my veins
Destruction of humanity the everlasting flame
Cast away no turning back from long forgotten shores
We'll show no mercy as they fall
The fire burns inside now prepare for war!

You fear the pain no longer
Daylight your heart be stronger
Don't even sense the burning hunger inside
Ride out with force and valor
In memory forever
Towards the battering and rise of the tide

Stand now and break the chains
In unity we feel no pain
Forever torn apart from the haunting fears of my heart

Rage and fear from skies above the fire fuels my veins...

[Solo - Herman, Solos - Sam / Herman]

Looking around there's no fear in your heart
For I know you will never surrender
Everyone here raise their eyes to the sky
Now with strength and honor we fight
PREPARE FOR WAR!

[Solos - Sam / Herman / Sam]

Rage and fear from skies above the fire fuels my veins...

8. Once In A Lifetime
[Music: Sam Totman, Lyrics: ZP Theart, Sam Totman]

Dark clouds and thunderstorms in the fires and flames were born
Through darkness traveling on the night
Hellfires and rain will fall, time is coming for us all
Our journey for the guiding light

Firelight it is burning so bright in the dark of the night
As we fight for the glory tonight there's nowhere to hide
On the wings of your destiny brings all the power you crave
Careful now if not you then who else will we save

Lost in this world total stranger
Death by the sword a common danger
You know that everything is not what it seems
March on all night forever searching
Daylight ahead is coming again
Break through the walls and use the power of your dreams

Once in a lifetime take a chance at the right time the glory to see
Rise up for the time of your life
Now the time has come for you to be free

In the minds of society we all live in harmony
Truth is that we all die in vain
You stand for what you believe
I kill for what I conceive
Is there then a title for this game?

Far away in the wastelands of hell full of torment and pain
Demon knights riding over the heights where the fallen are slain
Violent fury of firestorming death now no life will prevail
Now you live all your days in the fires of hell

Lost in this world total stranger
Death by the sword a common danger
You know that everything is not what it seems
March on all night forever searching
Daylight ahead coming again
Break through the walls and use the power of your dreams

Once in a lifetime take a chance at the right time the glory to see
Rise up for the time of your life
Now the time has come for you to be free

[Solos - Herman / Sam / Herman / Sam / Herman]

9. Cry Of The Brave
[Music: Vadim Pruzhanov, Lyrics: Vadim Pruzhanov, Herman Li, Sam Totman, ZP Theart]

Since the darkness took our minds
They burned our courage many died
Had to leave it all behind rebuild our lives
Passing memories remained
It made my soul a burning flame
Haunted dreams of my desire
Reveal my name

Raise our swords we fight for life
Shields and armor shining bright
Strike like dragons we have no fear
Our swords are made of steel

[Chorus:]
Fly across the high seas and mountains
Rise above the golden horizon
Far away beyond the gates of space and time
Through the wastelands forever and on
Still we fight on for our freedom
The cry of the fallen souls bleeding
Forever journey through the lands of ice and snow
Will we face all the fears of the world?
The cry of the brave

Since the time we saw the sign
Destruction of your feeble mind
Centuries have come and gone but nothing's changed
Hopes and dreams have disappeared
Destruction of your kind is near
Trapped inside your suffering eternal flame

Search the darkness search the light
Fierce resistance what a fight
Glory for unholy seal
Lies all cast in steel

[Chorus]

[Solos - Herman / Sam / Herman / Sam]

In the depths of your desire
So secretly you feed the fire
Burning through the memories of all our lives
Watch the day turn into night
You reach out for that guiding light
First to be the one to hear their blinding lies

Fear of darkness fear of light
Sucked in by their ancient might
Ruthless in what you may feel
When your mind they steal

[Chorus]

1. Holding On
Steel of our brave hearts trapped inside
In frozen illusion
High is the mountain we must climb
Reach out for rebellion

Rise up to the open sky
One chance at the price of glory
Fire in a thousand blazing skies
One lifetime ascending
Strong as an army side by side
Still brave and defending

March on through the tragic lands
Cold tears in the north wind falling
Raise your souls high
See the new dawn arise through the

[CHORUS]
Sands of all time, mystery of life
Everlasting sadness through light years gone by
land lost in time, once more back where we belong
Promises of yesterday, we'll keep holding on

Silent and twisted lifeless mind
So blind in delusion
Cursed by the emptiness inside
Cast out in confusion

Strike back with the power in hand
Break free from a past life dying
Onwards we strive till
The answers we'll find in the

[CHORUS]

Still lost alone and I'm dying
Daylight the world is still crying
Evermore we'll search throughout a lifetime

[SOLOS: HERMAN / SAM]

Stars are falling down tonight,
light the path where eagles fly
Find the strength inside us, a new world reborn
Silent tears of pain we cried,
raise our hands unto the sky
Break the chains that bind us,
One movement in time as we

Rise up to the open sky
One chance at the price of glory
Raise your souls high
See the new dawn arise through the

Sands of all time, mystery of life
Everlasting sadness through light years gone by
land lost in time, once more back where we belong
Memories of life to pray for
Everlasting price to pay for
Promises of yesterday, we'll keep holding on

Woah, Woah, Woah, Woah

Sands of all time, once more we'll rise up again
Stand alone and fight till the end

[SOLO: HERMAN]

2. Fallen World
Soldiers of fire
Rage of the universe
Cold steel and bloodshed
In the lost barren wasteland

Fear rising higher,
Rage of the winter war
Death calls at night fall,
Our hatred still burns as

We march through endless skies
Mankind will fall, death will arise

[Chorus:]
For a lifetime we fight without reason,
Still we wait for the warriors return
Though we're cast out and broken, we still carry on
Alone in a lost fallen world
Woah-Yeah!

Flames burning higher,
Curse of the winter land,
Black, torn, and twisted
In the fast-fading twilight

Storm winds still blowing
Steel shapes our destiny,
Death calls at night fall
Our curse with be lifted

Disguise this timeless crime
Brave men will fall, evil will rise!

[Chorus]

Still heroes we're born with promises so blind
The light at the end of the road that we all must climb (climb)

[SOLOS: HERMAN / SAM + VADIM / SAM / HERMAN]

For a lifetime we fight without reason
Still we wait for the warriors return
Though we're cast out and broken we still carry on
Alone in a lost fallen world
Alone in a lost fallen world

Woah-Yeah!

3. Cry Thunder
Time after time as we march side by side
Through the valleys of evil and the torturing souls,
Night after night, for the glory we fight,
In the kingdom of madness and the tales from the old

Death by our hands, for the higher command,
As the darkness surrounds us hear the cries as they fall
Fire burning steel and the tyrants will kneel
Hearts burning stronger with the power of the sword

Set sail for the glory,
Pray for the master of war (pray for the master of war)
Sunlight will fall by the wastelands,
Endless rise for the heroes before

Cry thunder!
Sword in his hand,
Titans of justice, fearless we stand
Cry thunder!
Strong in command
Blessed by the union, freedom of man

Reckoning day, for the demons we slay,
With the force of a dragon we will conquer them all!
Chaos still reigns devastation and flames
For the ultimate glory when the legacy calls

March on
Through the hellfire
Blazing for the darkness beyond (blazing for the darkness beyond)
Nightmare return of the thousands
Screaming rise to the heroes once more

Cry thunder!
Sword in his hand,
Titans of justice, fearless we stand
Cry thunder!
Strong in command
Blessed by the union, freedom of man

[Solos]

Unholy darkness,
In the eyes of broken dreams,
Outside of the wasted and torn,
A land of tears still remains
Soldiers of destiny calling,
And the fallen will rise up again,
Conquer the forces of evil and fight to the end

Cry thunder!
Sword in his hand,
Titans of justice, fearless we stand
Cry thunder!
Strong in command,
Saviour of nations, freedom of man

Cry thunder!
Sword in his hand,
Warriors defending,
One final stand
Cry thunder!
Strong in command,
Blessed by the union, freedom of man

Blessed by the union of man
Cry thunder!
Yeah yeah

4. Give Me The Night
[SOLO: HERMAN]

Falling gradually, endlessly the perfect disease
Everyone's a winner but you're down on your knees
Sanity is passing one more shot if you please
For the one final game I won't be playing

Still the same tempting voice in my mind
Losing grip on it all (losing grip on it all)
Carry on through the endless lies
'Cause I can't see a reason why

[CHORUS]
Give me the night
Let me be me for one last time
A prisoner of myself lost in disguise
Just give me the night
Still living in a twisted dream
There's no tomorrow for right now will be
The best time of my life

Hammering, sickening, torment and pain
Blind ambition to poison my brain
Cheating, lying, begging, stealing day after day
For the one final dose I won't be saving

Pure darkness consuming my life
Don't wanna die here alone (die here alone)
Walk away from reality
Got a date with the enemy

[CHORUS]

The best time of my life!

[SOLOS: FRED / HERMAN / SAM]

Still the same tempting voice in my mind
Losing grip on it all (losing grip on it all)
Carry on through the endless lies
'Cause I can't see a reason why

[CHORUS]

YEAH!

5. Wings Of Liberty
Outside of this world,
There's a life force still burning
Outside of this land
There's a star shining free

In silence we stand,
On a golden horizon, calling
This time there's a light for us
Still shining so bright for us
Again

Trapped inside this paradise still bleeding
While there are so many faces in this mask of lies
Blinded by the promises and the life in pain
Now the time has come for all of us to rise

Through the fires of hell between us
Through a lifetime of our dreams
Endless tears still burn inside
Beneath the sadness of our screams

And the years of our forsaken lands
Silent we stand here alone
Nothing to say when the evil finally burns

We all stand in silence for the wasted and gone
One warrior standing through a thousand year storm
Our past lives still shining, the starlight reveals
Our glory remembered for the power of the steel

And the winter rain will fall, around the brave and fallen
Like the sands of endless time, they'll never be forgotten
We all stand in silence for the wasted and gone,
For the last time we cry now for freedom

Cast aside, this dying world forsakes us
Break the chains of our creation now to save our lives
Blight of all eternity and the curse of steel
Like the winter rain will tear the blazing skies

From the wastelands of destruction
With the fire we hold inside
Rise again, still glorious
For the power of all mankind

Through the years of our forsaken lands
Silent we stand here alone
Nothing to say when the evil finally burns

We all stand in silence for the wasted and gone
One warrior standing, through a thousand years strong
Our past lives still shining, the starlight reveals
Our glory remembered, with the power of the steel

And the winter rain will fall, around the brave and fallen
Like the sands of endless time, they'll never be forgotten
We all stand in silence for the wasted and gone,
For the last time we cry now for freedom

[SOLOS: VADIM / HERMAN / SAM / FRED]

Through the trials of fire behind us,
In the dark and burning skies
Fallen tears still lost inside
Within the memories of our lives

And the years of our forsaken lands
Silent we stand here alone
Nothing to say when the evil finally burns

We all stand in silence for the wasted and gone
One warrior standing, through a thousand years strong
Our past lives still shining, the starlight reveals
Our glory remembered, with the power of the steel

And the winter rain will fall, around the brave and fallen
Like the sands of endless time, they'll never be forgotten
We all stand in silence for the wasted and gone,
For the last time we cry now for freedom

For the last tiem we cry now for freedom... AGAIN!!!

6. Seasons
I'm searching through emptiness
And tried to forget us in vain
The light of the dark setting sun
Will bring my sadness to an end

Voices cry out through the fear and the doubt
As we wait for our lives to be better

[CHORUS]
The words are dying in the night
No winter lasts forever
The seasons pass and sunlight will shine on my life again
So let the past now burn down in flames

Locked in a prison, in a world of living fear
On the edge of my destruction marching on
Still suffer in darkness with the dreams of life not meant to be
As I lie awake and curse the rising sun

Sadness inside from the truth that she hides
And this pain in my heart for no reason

[CHORUS]

[SOLO: SAM]

Stare into my eyes, I'm burning with lust and desire
Won't you come down and let yourself go in the fire
So leave the past behind

[SOLO: HERMAN / FRED + VADIM]

The words are dying in the night
No winter lasts forever
The seasons pass and sunlight will shine on my life again
So leave the past behind

The dark clouds fading from my mind (fading from my mind)
No pain will last forever (last forever)
The seasons pass and sunlight will shine on my life again
So let the past now burn down in flames
Now burn down in flames

[SOLO: FRED]

7. Heart Of The Storm
Silently marching our quest for revenge
Lost in the forgotten tragedy
Scars of the past still alive in our veins
Onwards we fight to our destiny

Trample their forces we now overrun
Sign of the power inside of us
Cities in ruins and lives are destroyed
Stand at the edge of the universe

Suffering fills the open sky
Battering down the pain inside
Memories hide the moonlight sky till the end of our days

Conquering lands and fallen heroes
Sanity torn we ride on fearless
Victory sounds a thousand miles away

[CHORUS]
Into this world in wonder from a starlight sky
For a lifetime of freedom and the legend is born
Once more unbroken, the price we will pay
On this march into fire, the heart of the storm

Endless destruction consuming our land
Legions of darkness destroy mankind
Storming the wasteland we now overcome
Vanquising evil insane we find

Rise of the slain, breaking the chains
Fight through the whirlwind of doom

Live for the day, conquer the pain
Under the light of the moon

[CHORUS]

[SOLOS: SAM / HERMAN / SAM / HERMAN]

Outside the endless rain
Crushed by the burning pain
This life goes on forever after
Across the universe, on through the twilight sky
And still we feel the fire go on and on

[CHORUS]

8. Die By The Sword
Outside the battle ragin death upon us
No surrender unchained and free
Insanity will lead to blind destruction
Crush the evil, the foul disease

Our final destination reborn in darkness
Watching and waiting destroying with ease
The judgement day upon us as dawn is breaking
Mankind will fall to the spineless decieved

[CHORUS]
Fly through the storm, power of the steel
Striking with vegence, force them to kneel
Soldiers unite, force of the world
Fight till the end we will die by the sword

Fight on in foreign fields of mass destruction
Stand as one, no man left behind
Our final victory, tonight awaits us
Slain in darkness behind the lines

Raise the dead, ride beside of me
Fallen heroes, of a thousand moons
Blaze ahead the price that they now pay
On the march to their doom

[CHORUS]

Fight till the end we will die by the sword

Light the fires of freedom, on the shores of endless seas
Wings of glory guide us, on the path to victory
Light the fires of freedom, on the shores of endless seas
Wings of glory guide us, on the path to victory

[SOLOS: SAM / HERMAN]

Outside the battle raging death upon us
No surrender unchained and free
Insaniy will lead to blind destruction
Crush the evil, the foul disease

[CHORUS]

9. Last Man Stands
[SOLO: SAM]

One man remains
And the stars seem to change
Far beyond our universe tonight

And the cries of the brave
And the skies filled with pain
For the silent ones we pray for all tonight

New dawn rising destruction and pain
Long days passing the fear of the rain
Soldiers fighting on the price they will pay
Nuclear meltdown the world uncertain from the

Power of the tragedy of man's creation
Rise from the suffering for our salvation

Fearless we stand strong till the end, at the trial of all our lives
Now say our final goodbyes

[CHORUS]
Light the path for the journey home
Save a prayer for the lost alone
Find a way from the other side
Before the heroes task still binding
Through the long nights across the seas
Shine a light for eternity
Find a way beyond the other side
Until the last man stands for all mankind

[SOLO: HERMAN]

Skies now blackened the night turns to day
Nations fearful of global decay
Fires still raging on in vain now we pray
Nuclear fallout the fortunes fading as we

Stand at the edge barren desolation
Fight for the future of our generation

Fearless we stand, brave we defend
For a thousand years gone by
Now say our final goodbyes

[CHORUS]

[SOLOS: HERMAN / SAM / VADIM / SAM]

[CHORUS]

And the fate of the world in our hands
Rise again until the end of time
Until the last man stands for all mankind

10. Seasons (Acoustic Version)
[SOLO: FRED]

I'm searching through emptiness
And tried to forget us in vain
The light of the dark setting sun
Will bring my sadness to an end

Voices cry out through the fear and the doubt
As we wait for our lives to be better

[CHORUS]
The words are dying in the night
No winter lasts forever
The seasons pass and sunlight will shine on my life again
So let the past now burn down in flames

Oooooh....

Locked in a prison, in a world of living fear
On the edge of my destruction marching on
Still suffer in darkness with the dreams of life not meant to be
As I lie awake and curse the rising sun

Sadness inside from the truth that she hides
And this pain in my heart for no reason

[CHORUS]

[SOLO]

Voices cry out through the fear and the doubt
As we wait for our lives to be better

The words are dying in the night
No winter lasts forever
The seasons pass and sunlight will shine on my life again
So leave the past behind

The dark clouds fading from my mind (fading from my mind)
No pain will last forever (last forever)
The seasons pass and sunlight will shine on my life again
So let the past now burn down in flames
Burn down in flames

Oooooh... Woah

11. Cry Thunder (Live Rehearsal)
[Bonus Track]Time after time, as we march side by side
Through the valleys of evil and the torturing souls
Night after night, for the glory we fight
In the kingdom of madness and the tales from the old

Death by our hands, for the higher command
As the darkness surrounds us in the quiet as they fall
Fire burning steel, and the tyrants will kneel
Hearts burning stronger with the power of the sword

Set sail for the glory
Pray for the master of war
Sunlight will fall by the wastelands
Endless rise to the heroes before

[Chorus:]
Cry thunder
Sword in his hand
Titans of justice, fearless we stand
Cry thunder
Strong in command
Blessed by the union, freedom of man

Reckoning day, for the demons we slay
With the force of a dragon we will conquer them all
Chaos still reigns, devastation and flames
With the ultimate glory when the legacy calls

March on through the hellfire
Blazing through the darkness beyond
Nightmares return of the thousands
Giving rise to the heroes once more

[Chorus]

[Solo]

Unholy darkness
In the eyes of broken dreams
Outside of the wasted and torn
a land of tears still remains
Soldiers of destiny calling
and the fallen will rise up again
Conquer the forces of evil and fight to the end

Cry thunder
Sword in his hand
Titans of justice, fearless we stand
Cry thunder
Strong in command
Savior of nations, freedom of man

Cry thunder
Sword in his hand
Warriors defending, one final stand
Cry thunder
Strong in command
Blessed by the union, freedom of man

Blessed by the union of man
Cry thunder

12. Heart Of The Storm (Alternative Chorus Version)
[Bonus Track]Silently marching, our quest for revenge
Lost in the forgotten tragedy
Scars of the past still alive in our veins
Onwards we fight to our destiny

Trample their forces we now overrun
Sign of the power inside of us
Cities in ruins and lives are destroyed
Stand at the edge of the universe

Suffering fills the open sky
Battering down the pain inside
Memories hide the moonlight sky
Till the end of our days

Conquering lands and fallen heroes
Sanity torn we ride on fearless
Victory sounds a thousand miles away

[Chorus:]
And still we stand alone before the moonlight rider
Rise again to light the power inside us
Fires of hell inside of the darkness burning
Far away from me
Ride again before the light, still shining
Fly towards, before the far horizon
Fires of hell inside of the darkness burning
Far away from me
In the dead of night

Endless destruction consuming our land
Legions of darkness destroy mankind
Storming the wasteland we now overcome
Vanquishing evil, insane we find

Rise of the slain, breaking the chains
Fight through the whirlwind of doom
Live for the day, conquer the pain
Under the light of the moon

[Chorus]

[Solo]

Outside the endless rain
Crushed by the burning pain
This life goes on forever after
Across the universe
On through the twilight sky
And still we feel the fire go on and on

[Chorus]

1. Reaching Into Infinity
[Instrumental]
2. Ashes Of The Dawn
Trapped in this maze of existence entombed by misery, 
I was blinded by my fears
Lost in the dark through the shadows I heard you scream my name
Oh help me, please, out of this nightmare!

All my life I've been playing with fire,
set me free that's my only desire

The time has come for me, 
The time to overcome and do what is right for the world to see
And from the ashes of the dawn I arise 

The time has come for me, 
The time to overcome and do what is right for the world to see
And from the ashes of the dawn I arise 

Fear deep inside, is it madness that fueled my ecstasy
Now I'm drowning in my sorrows
Lord answer my prayers, lost in despair, is this the end?
Breaking the silence so real, we'll make it together

All my dreams have been torn to pieces
Hear the screams of my eternal pain

The time has come for me, 
The time to overcome and do what is right for the world to see
And from the ashes of the dawn I arise 

The time has come for me, 
The time to overcome and do what is right for the world to see
And from the ashes of the dawn I arise 

Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Solo: Sam/Herman]

I have seen the sorrow in your eyes
How I wish I'd made things better,
Find the strength to leave the past behind,
Just one more time, we'll live again

The time has come for me, 
The time to overcome and do what is right for the world to see
And from the ashes of the dawn I arise 

The time has come for me, 
The time to overcome and do what is right for the world to see
And from the ashes of the dawn I arise 

Forever!

3. Judgement Day
I feel the magic burning deep inside of me
No one can change the path of our true destiny

Don't be ashamed about the way we are
Another life awaits beyond the stars
We're calling
We're falling

A flood of passion now, I feel the urge in me
A generation shamed by all reality

But now this life's a raging battlefield
Though one day soon the truth will be revealed
The final judgment day

Riding on the wings of time
Feel the fire from the sky
Hold the power deep inside
Not afraid to die
We are the masters of the universe
On we ride towards the sign
Where the revelation hides
We're the guardians of the light
'Til the end of time
Until we see the last sunrise
And set the world on fire tonight

Forever walking, cold inside and all alone
A raging thunder far beyond our icy home

We close our eyes and feel the tears so cold
The ghosts of vengeance of the barren souls
Our one true judgment day

Riding on the wings of time
Feel the fire from the sky
Hold the power deep inside
Not afraid to die
We are the masters of the universe
On we ride towards the sign
Where the revelation hides
We're the guardians of the light
'Til the end of time
Until we see the last sunrise
And set the world on fire tonight

We reached for the moon
We conquered the stars
We cried for the tears of yesterday

Still strong to the end
'Til we'll meet again
Remember the glory of the brave

We stand at the dawn
Our kingdom reborn
And wait for the sun to rise again
A light in the sky
So free and so wild
A light from our last eternal flame

4. Astral Empire
Hear the cries of war
At the break of dawn
See the evil spread disease and fear to all

Through the centuries
Blood shall be the key
Now a leader of our destiny

As his army rose
Crushing endless foes
From the battle he will rain fires of hell from the sky

Bringer of the fire
For the great empire
Rising power of the fallen warriors' souls

Steel crushing steel, see the great fire descend from the sky
Never surrender, one day we'll be free
Flee from the swarm, through the forces of terror
No sacrifice 'til the end

Fly far away through the raging storm
'Til the end with the rise of the sun
On the winds rising higher through our astral empire
Break the chains, now this war shall be won

Hunting down their prey
From beyond the grave
Crush them into dust, a life of worthless slaves

Soon the world will see
Evil prophecy
Now we shall avenge a thousand warriors' souls

Now dark knowledge is mine
Voices inside
Witness the fall for the last time

Black is the power
Now is the hour to decide
Once more to

Fly far away through the raging storm
'Til the end with the rise of the sun
On the winds rising higher through our astral empire
Break the chains, now this war shall be won

Now dark knowledge is mine
Voices inside
Witness the fall for the last time

Black is the power
Now is the hour to decide
Once more to

Fly far away through the raging storm
'Til the end with the rise of the sun
On the winds rising higher through our astral empire
Break the chains, now this war shall be won

5. Curse Of Darkness
Here I stand, no one will ever ease my pain, blood is the answer
Until the end, I fight for my life and I never will surrender
Vengeance is mine, driven by sorrow and eternal hatred
Blood legacy, hear my endless cries

Shattered dreams, I am a shadow of the man I used to be
But I know tonight, your pain will be my delight
Hear the symphony from the score of the damned
Unleashing the eternal fire

Ride on your way, this is your curse of darkness
Ride through the night and one day you'll be free
Look to the sky where our hope's burning bright
Hear the laments of innocence rise

All alone, I am lost in the maze of this aeonian nightmare
Torn within, bound to suffer 'til I die
For centuries, just like the king of Ephira trapped for eternity
Haunted soul, I have the force to slay your kind

Ride on your way, this is your curse of darkness
Ride through the night and one day you'll be free
Look to the sky where our hope's burning bright
Hear the laments of innocence rise

As I look to the stars, I feel your presence in my heart
How I wish I could hear your voice again
Like my tears in the night, your memory still shining bright
On this lonely road I ride
Wandering... through the circles of Hell

Ride on your way, this is your curse of darkness
Ride through the night and one day you'll be free
Look to the sky where our hope's burning bright
Hear the laments of innocence rise

6. Silence
Silence, here in the sunset of my life
I've been walking through the darkness
With your ghost by my side
How I've tried, but can never stop the pain I feel
I have tried so hard but the wounds never heal

Now the time has come for our last goodbye
As I raise my head and gaze up to the skies
I have tried in vain but this is the end
We will meet again
I will be again

Mother, these are the final words I'll write
I know they're full of sadness, I know they'll make you cry
How I've tried to hide the truth of my despair
The sadness kept on calling, drowning out my prayers

There's no place for me, I'm torn apart
And I wish I could have made things better

Now the time has come for our last goodbye
As I raise my head and gaze up to the skies
I have tried in vain but this is the end
We will meet again
I will be again

There's no place for me, and deep inside
This pain won't last forever

Now the time has come for our last goodbye
As I raise my head and gaze up to the skies
I have tried in vain but this is the end
We will meet again
I will be again

7. Midnight Madness
March on the fire in the sky
Live now, tomorrow we may die
Stand strong, desire to survive
'Til the end of time

No more, you'll never walk alone
Starlight will guide us to our home
Reborn, the sands of time are sown
'Til we claim our throne

Aggravation, termination
Generations in starvation
Mass salvation of the nation now

We will fly tonight towards the angels
See our stars shine bright into the sky
We will stand tonight and live forever
We're the masters of the stars and of all time

We will fly tonight towards the angels
See our stars shine bright into the sky
And we will stand tonight and live forever
We're the masters of the stars and of all time

Dark clouds, the symphony of war
Stare now into the crystal ball
Stay strong and face the winter storm
'Til the final call

Strike now, the power from within
Hunt down and crush them for their sins
This time the battle we will win
So it now begins

Suffocation, desperation
From sedation to predation
Blind destruction of creation now

We will fly tonight towards the angels
See our stars shine bright into the sky
We will stand tonight and live forever
We're the masters of the stars and of all time

We will fly tonight towards the angels
See our stars shine bright into the sky
And we will stand tonight and live forever
We're the masters of the stars and of all time

Once lost but now we're free
To the night we hold the key
Silently we wait the last command

Guardians of space and time
To the mountain we must climb
At the gates of glory we now stand
For the final stand

We will fly tonight towards the angels
See our stars shine bright into the sky
We will stand tonight and live forever
We're the masters of the stars and of all time

We will fly tonight towards the angels
See our stars shine bright into the sky
And we will stand tonight and live forever
We're the masters of the stars and of all time

8. War!
Appearing out of nowhere you came into my life
And took control before I realized
I remember clearly the things you used to say
But now I see the truth behind your lies

I try to make you listen, I try to make you see
It's nothing but a total waste of time
You think you know better, and do what you do best
You love to bring us down, but now it's time you listen

Caught by the winds of the fury within
Leading slowly to your own demise
Why don't you see that you are your worst enemy?
And that fight must come to an end

War
Now this is war
Straight from the core
Hear the wrath and the thunder
Punishment from the skies
I will crush your empire
Empire of disguise

Blinded and deluded
You think you've seen it all
You think you're always right and can't be wrong
Poisonous and selfish
You cannot face the truth
And blame the world for your pathetic life
You lie, you cheat, you backstab, and you're completely fake
Relying on a fragile house of cards
You always point the finger
How easy must it be?
To spend your life blindfolded and disguised

Caught by the winds of the fury within
Leading slowly to your own demise
Why don't you see that you are your worst enemy?
And that fight must come to an end

War
Now this is war
Straight from the core
Hear the wrath and the thunder
Punishment from the skies
I will crush your empire
Empire of disguise

For so many tears, for so many lies
For so many prophecies never fulfilled
I promise you now, you'll pay for your crimes
It ends tonight

Now this is war
We won't take it anymore

Appearing out of nowhere you came into my life
And took control before I realized
I remember clearly the things you used to say
But now I see the truth behind your lies

Caught by the winds of the fury within
Leading slowly to your own demise
Why don't you see that you are your worst enemy?
And that fight must come to an end

War
Now this is war
Straight from the core
Hear the wrath and the thunder
Punishment from the skies
I will crush your empire
Empire of disguise

9. Land Of Shattered Dreams
Can you imagine your life?
Desolate, detached, and all alone
Your best friend is your desperation
In a world of unbelievers, how are we to keep our dreams alive?
Sometimes escape seems like the answer

Take one last chance
A chance to start it over
Somewhere, somehow
A place we all belong

Within this land of shattered dreams
Where the days seem never-ending
Can you ask yourself tonight what it means?
Can we really leave this world behind?
For just a moment in a lifetime
And a chance to be free
From all reality

Who said that what we all see
Is exactly what we must believe?
Sometimes it's hard to know the difference
In a world of mass illusion
Who are we to question what is real
Sometimes it feels like mass confusion

Take one last chance
A chance to start it over
Somewhere, somehow
A place we all belong

Within this land of shattered dreams
Where the days seem never-ending
Can you ask yourself tonight what it means?
Can we really leave this world behind?
For just a moment in a lifetime
And a chance to be free
From all reality

Take one last chance
A chance to start it over
Somewhere, somehow
A place we all belong

Within this land of shattered dreams
Where the days seem never-ending
Can you ask yourself tonight what it means?
Can we really leave this world behind?
For just a moment in a lifetime
And a chance to be free
From all reality

10. The Edge Of The World
In times of fear and mystery, when the gods had ruled the earth
Sound the bells of victory
The sign of our rebirth
How many died in vain, like waves against the shore
No one hears their whispers anymore

Lost, like the hope in the battle we fought
Through the cold and the rain
Gone, like the years in the shadows and pain, unknown

I've seen through the eyes of the dead
And suffered for them time and again
Granted with immortality
The price for the savior of humanity

Rise from the ashes of mankind
He walks into the fire
With the fate of us all in his hands
And the sadness fills his eyes
The prophecies of Babylon
As he stands at the edge of the world

Long, is the journey, oh, long is the road
As the sun rises over the world
The quest is hard 'til the battle can end
But I have the power in my hands

I've seen through the eyes of the dead
And suffered for them time and again
Granted with immortality
The price for the savior of humanity

Rise from the ashes of mankind
He walks into the fire
With the fate of us all in his hands
And the sadness fills his eyes
The prophecies of Babylon
As he stands at the edge of the world

Honor, the god of Enlil
Silence for the beast is now the prey
Denied a chance for life
I take back that what is mine
Die

Wrath, we rule the skies
May the rain cleanse and wash away
Imperfect, these creations of mine
Corrupted by greed, they shall pay

Chosen, saved from death's embrace

One last chance for man to change his ways
Deified, a place amongst the gods
Saved from mankind's own demise

Rise from the ashes of mankind
He walks into the fire
With the fate of us all in his hands
And the sadness fills his eyes
The prophecies of Babylon
As he stands at the edge of the world

From the ashes of mankind
He walks into the fire
With the fate of us all in his hands
And the sadness fills his eyes
The prophecies of Babylon
As he stands at the edge of the world

At the end of the journey for the savior of the earth
Sound the bells of victory through the signs of our rebirth
As the shadows fade away, we watch the new sun rise
No one fears the darkness anymore

11. Our Final Stand
Time, for so many years we have wandered
Lost in the still of the night, ready to fight
Burning steel agony revealed
A quest to reconquer our land

Marching north, showing no remorse
Our destiny caught in our hands

And one day we will be free again
One more time we will be free again
And we'll break the chains
That bound us and tore us apart

Cry, under the gaze of the moonlight
And blood-red skies
The deafening silence of anguish
Becoming mine

Straight ahead, rising from the dead
An army of relentless souls
We must hold, through the northern cold
We'll fight them until the end

Cleansed by the tears of the fallen
Echoing fears of the warriors
Honor and glory will comfort us all
Living alone, dying alone, we make our final stand

Cleansed by the tears of the fallen
Echoing fears of the warriors
Honor and glory will comfort us all
Living alone, dying alone, we gotta make a final stand

Cleansed by the tears of the fallen
Echoing fears of the warriors
Honor and glory will comfort us all
Living alone, dying alone, we make our final stand

12. Hatred And Revenge
[Bonus Track]I saw the ravens in the distant sky
I searched the mountains for the eternal fire
I fought the dragon through the sands of time
We race through the wind, to glory ride

We cross the valley to the distant sun
We feel the power, our revenge is sworn
We crushed the cities and the war is won
The fire in our soul, we're standing strong

Kingdom
Calling
Raise the cannons of war

Ride from the mountains and rise from the seas
Steel of the warriors, you bow to your knees
Sail through the darkness, the true prophecy
Cursed is the night in the sea of dreams

Ride from the mountains and rise from the seas
Steel of the warriors, you bow to your knees
Sail through the darkness, the true prophecy
Cursed is the night in the sea of dreams

A blaze of light beyond the eastern sky
This dance of doom towards the ivory tower
A vengeful death awaits for all this time
The judgment has passed, we all now die

A maze of torment for a thousand souls
The unseen fury of the ancient scrolls
The years of torture that had been foretold
A lifetime of fear they now behold

Kingdom
Calling
Raise the cannons of war

Ride from the mountains and rise from the seas
Steel of the warriors, you bow to your knees
Sail through the darkness, the true prophecy
Cursed is the night in the sea of dreams

Ride from the mountains and rise from the seas
Steel of the warriors, you bow to your knees
Sail through the darkness, the true prophecy
Cursed is the night in the sea of dreams

I saw the ravens in the distant sky
I searched the mountains for the eternal fire
I fought the dragon through the sands of time
We race through the wind, to glory ride

Kingdom
Calling
Raise the cannons of war

Ride from the mountains and rise from the seas
Steel of the warriors, you bow to your knees
Sail through the darkness, the true prophecy
Cursed is the night in the sea of dreams

Ride from the mountains and rise from the seas
Steel of the warriors, you bow to your knees
Sail through the darkness, the true prophecy
Cursed is the night in the sea of dreams

13. Evil Dead
[Bonus Track][originally by Death]Trapped inside
A life is not yours
Spirits within
Causing terror, fear, and darkness

Evil dead
Evil dead

Voice speaks out
All will die tonight
Insanity
Fills your mind, you hear them call

Evil dead
Evil dead

Covered in blood
All hope is lost
Forever to rot
Controlled by the powers of the

Evil dead
Evil dead

14. Gloria
[Bonus Track][originally by ZIGGY]As I stared at the clouds I could see a vision of you
I could see my desire was still uncertain but still so true
Still I long to believe there will soon be a brighter day
Underneath this disguise still I walk through the pouring rain

I wanna make it tonight
Owaranai yoru ni
You have no need now to cry
Owaranai MERODII wo

So tonight I will send you my own melody
But the time passes by and I can't stop the lies it seems
Still I wait for you now, living life on a broken dream
Cannot hide the frustration inside, now I'm on my knees

I wanna make it tonight
Owaranai yoru ni
You have no need now to cry
Owaranai MERODII wo

Gloria, I need your love
Omae no atsui HEART de HOLD ME TIGHT
LONELY NIGHT Mou nidoto misenai de

1. The Game
Messed up, once again
told me it's OK
but this path that I'm taking
I'm lost in the deep end

One last chance, never more
told me it's all right
in this sea of denial
I'm cleansed in the fire

So why is it me,
am I blinded or too blind to see?
[growl] (am I too blind to see?!)
why was I born?
not a part of this society?

Again and again I tried
so hard, to reach for the stars
but I failed you all
tried to keep standing tall
never had a real chance at all
but still I'm searching

Same thing, different day
tried to make a change
left with nothing more to live for
but everything to die for
humanity, insanity, the everlasting grip
lost all will to keep trying
our bed we must lie in

So why was I born
Not a part of this society?

Again and again I tried
so hard, to reach for the stars
but I failed you all
tried to keep standing tall
never had a real chance at all
but still I'm searching for

[chorus]
Ten thousand ways to say sorry
but life writes its own tragic story
time marches onwards and
nothing can ever be the same

But we'll pray for a brighter tomorrow
break free from this lifetime of sorrow
years pass us by but we're all just a part of the game

[solos]

[2x]
I tried so hard
to reach for the stars
but I failed you all
tried to keep standing tall
never had a real chance at all
but still I'm searching

[chorus]
For ten thousand ways to say sorry
but life writes its own tragic story
time marches onwards and
nothing can ever be the same

But we'll pray for a brighter tomorrow
break free from this lifetime of sorrow
years pass us by but we're all just a part of the game

2. Tomorrow King
Candles burning, the hours turning
A countdown the day that we're born
Don't look backwards, keep driving forwards
The rose withers but not the thorns

If you want it, then you can take it
Just seize it before it's too late
And if all fails, get back on your feet
There's always another today but still we'll

Pray for one last chance to prove we all belong
Through the dark nights and cold days while time marches on

In this life we're running out of days
We're running out of time, ignoring it's a crime
No regrets, just one shot at glory
Is all we got before we die
Sands of time are slipping through our hands
So try and understand and do it while you can
Don't look back, just one shot at glory
Is all it takes to feel alive

Anger rising with endless fighting
But soon you'll be finally free
Find your way through this endless maze
Be the one that you wanted to be

Pray for one last chance to prove we all belong
Through the dark nights and cold days while time marches on

In this life we're running out of days
We're running out of time, ignoring it's a crime
No regrets, just one shot at glory
Is all we got before we die
Sands of time are slipping through our hands
So try and understand and do it while you can
Don't look back, just one shot at glory
Is all it takes to feel alive

Fear not a twisted future, no matter what it brings
Can't you see now, you're all tomorrow's kings
Tomorrow's kings!

Pray for one last chance to prove we all belong
Through the dark nights and cold days while time marches on

In this life we're running out of days
We're running out of time, ignoring it's a crime
No regrets, just one shot at glory
Is all we got before we die
Sands of time are slipping through our hands
So try and understand and do it while you can
Don't look back, just one shot at glory
Is all it takes to feel alive

3. No More
[feat. Matt Heafy]The light is shining
Still I'm not so surprised
One thousand voice mails
For one thousand lies

Blind faith, lost trust
All along it was plain to see
Years passed, lost touch
Leads the path to insanity

Take another shot, show me what you got
It was never gonna last forever
Open your eyes, try and realize
Once is enough so tonight now I say

No more, from a voice that breaks the awkward silence
No more, never heard so loud before
Made the same mistakes a thousand times
Never meant to be like this so I say
No more tonight
And it feels all right

Dark nights, long passed
Waking up from a pointless dream
Brighter days, brighter times
Hides the fatal reality

Questions, answers
False addiction to nothing real
Lights fade, crushed to dust
Desperation in tragedy

Take another shot, show me what you got
It was never gonna last forever
Open your eyes, try and realize
Once is enough so tonight now I say

No more, from a voice that breaks the awkward silence
No more, never heard so loud before
Made the same mistakes a thousand times
Never meant to be like this so I say
No more tonight
And it feels all right

(No more) Same old game we play together
(No more) Time will pass, we'll still remember
(No more) But tonight this game is over
(No more) Strangers in the night forever

No more, from a voice that breaks the awkward silence
No more, never heard so loud before
Made the same mistakes a thousand times
Never meant to be like this so I say
No more tonight
And it feels all right

And it feels all right

4. Three Hammers
Lost long ago through the ages of time
Once ruled immortal, the guardians of light
Bonded together, they stood side by side
Storm winds brought darkness, the world in decline

Quest for their hammers to reclaim the throne
Three brought together by warriors unknown
United to vanquish all hell from the earth
Conquering glory, the kingdom's rebirth

Raise your swords, sound the final war cry
Stand, fight, fight for your lives
Thousands will die but their deaths not in vain
Now reunited our world may be free once again

Three hammers high, in the burning red sky
Forged in the fire, protectors of mankind
Three hammers high, for the world we unite
Fight for our lives, as we hold up the three hammers high

Long have we travelled through forgotten lands
From coldest valleys to burning red sands
Restless we ride through the depths of all hell
Triumph and agony, death will prevail

Raise your swords, sound the final war cry
Stand, fight, fight for your lives
Strike back with vengeance, 'til death we defend
Until the day that the dragons will rise once again

Three hammers high, in the burning red sky
Forged in the fire, protectors of mankind
Three hammers high, for the world we unite
Fight for our lives, as we hold up the three hammers high

Strike down the unbelievers
March on for justice we now stand
Once more the path for glory
Take back the power in our hands

Long years of terror and the long years of pain
Still marching onwards 'til victory's ours once again
Victory's ours once again

Three hammers high, in the burning red sky
Forged in the fire, protectors of mankind
Three hammers high, for the world we unite
Fight for our lives, as we hold up the three hammers high

5. Symphony Of The Night
Hiding in the fog
Where darkness meets the moonlight
I will sing a melody 'til the morning comes
Living for you only
Take my hand and show me
There will be much sorrow when the morning comes

Fearless I’m fighting the pain burns inside of me
Find the forces of my soul
No one can understand me
Am I condemned to ride the blackest night alone?

Tragic painting on the walls
In this castle where affliction reigns
So many died in vain
Hear their distant cries
Never again!

This is my symphony
My dark blessing falls from the skies
I hear the voice
Rising from the void
Of the memories gone by
Dark is the path for me
I’ll find my peace another way
Under the stars where we’ll shine again some day

Torment and sadness unleashed through these corridors
Fear is leading to the night
Bloodline of vampires doomed to fulfill their need
Once united by the light
Father! Look into my eyes
I shall kill you tonight to avenge
All those who died in vain
Hear their distant cries
Never again!

This is my symphony
My dark blessing falls from the skies
I hear the voice
Rising from the void
Of the memories gone by
Dark is the path for me
I’ll find my peace another way
Under the stars where we’ll shine again some day

[Solo]

This is my symphony
My dark blessing falls from the skies
I hear the voice
Rising from the void
Of the memories gone by
Dark is the path for me
I’ll find my peace another way
Under the stars where we’ll shine again some day

'Til the stars where we’ll shine again some day
'Til the stars where we’ll shine again some day

6. The Sun Is Dead
Inception
Death’s guiding us away
We fight 'til the end
Among the ruins
Illusion
Of brighter days ahead
Through confusion and hatred, we try to understand
In silence we stand alone

Caught in the eye
A quest for life beneath the stormy sky
The strength to rise again

Time to realize
Our race has come to nothing
We'll start it all again

The sun is dead now
Fading away forever
The darkness prevails now
But with the prayers of the dead
Now a new light ascends from the stars

Confusion
The sadness and the pain
Matricide, the earth is now dead
Remember the brighter days
When hope and joy were shining in our hearts
Times have changed now, we suffer yet try to understand
In silence, we stand alone

Caught in the eye
The fragments of my past to realize
It's time to rise again

In the world's demise
Our race has come to nothing
We'll start it all again

The sun is dead now
Fading away forever
The darkness prevails now
But with the prayers of the dead
Now a new light ascends from the stars

The sun is dead now
But in the end, what did we learn?

The sun is dead now
Fading away forever
The darkness prevails now
But with the prayers of the dead
Now a new light ascends from the stars

Now a new light ascends from the stars

7. Defenders
Life's uncertain, a rat-race of pain
Endlessly searching for more
Hopeless and needless, held back by the chains
'Til we can't take anymore

Hold on, stay strong
Breaking out from the past life fading
No more, what for?
All we got is to keep on praying

Pray for the done for their lives in dismay
Witness the final decay
Suffering in silence for years we were blind
But now we got something to say

Hold on, stay strong
'Til the end, not afraid of dying
No more, what for?
Nothing left but to keep on fighting

[Pre-chorus:]
United, incited, not misguided
We'll fight through time before our one true destiny
Benighted, ignited, still strong and undivided
This day foretold now here for all to see

[Chorus:]
So free in the blue skies with time marches on
Once more maybe we'll find our peace to behold
Strangers in a strange world, defenders through time
Cleansed in a kingdom of fire

Legions of darkness from beyond the grave
Spill their blood under the sun
Voices are calling with anger and rage
The final war now has begun

Hold on, stay strong
'Til the end, not afraid of dying
No more, what for?
Nothing left but to keep on fighting

[Pre-chorus:]
United, incited, not misguided
We'll fight through time before our one true destiny
Benighted, ignited, still strong and undivided
This day foretold now here for all to see

So free in the blue skies with time marches on
Once more maybe we'll find our peace to behold
Strangers in a strange world, defenders through time
Cleansed in a kingdom of unholy fire

Hear our call, save us all
Standing tall tonight

The flame will slowly fade away
The shadows of our lives
We wash away the memories
Before the last sunrise

We'll keep holding on
In times of changes
Standing strong against the wind
Until the end of time

[Solo]

Hold on, stay strong
'Til the end, not afraid of dying
No more, what for?
Nothing left but to keep on fighting

[Pre-chorus:]
United, incited, not misguided
We'll fight through time before our one true destiny
Benighted, ignited, still strong and undivided
This day foretold now here for all to see

So free in the blue skies with time marches on
Once more maybe we'll find our peace to behold
Strangers in a strange world, defenders through time
Cleansed in a kingdom of unholy fire

[2x]
Hear our call, save us all
Standing tall tonight

8. Extraction Zone
"Uh, we got a killstreak coming up if anyone's interested."

It's getting late at night by a freezing moon
The time is running out and the end is soon
An army in despair, don't know what to do

Impure thoughts are raging in this empty room
The victims are escaping, now we shall regroup
The times are getting tougher as we face our doom

A circus of horrors waiting just for you
The barrel's bottom, anything will do
So take my hand and I will lead you right into

Extraction zone, the zone
You can make yourself at home
Extraction zone, your zone
You don't have to feel alone
Where dreams become reality
And standards will now cease to be
So live your life in the extraction zone

Another place, another time, we carry on
Not getting any easier 'cause we're getting on
A creature from another world, it's gone all wrong

A circus of horrors waiting just for you
The barrel's bottom, anything will do
So take my hand and I will lead you right into

Extraction zone, the zone
You can make yourself at home
Extraction zone, your zone
You don't have to feel alone
Where dreams become reality
And standards will now cease to be
So live your life in the extraction zone

As a new dawn will rise
I promise myself, not again
But deep in my heart
The fire still burns just the same
It's just the same

A circus of horrors waiting just for you
The barrel's bottom, anything will do
So take my hand and I will lead you right into

Extraction zone, your zone
You can make yourself at home
Extraction zone, the zone
You don't have to feel alone
Where dreams become reality
And standards will now cease to be
So live your life in the extraction zone

9. City Of Gold
Her dream was to shine on the screen
Thought that was why she was born
Left all behind without a fear inside
But sometimes there's no lucky star to help you

Sun will go down, and she's all alone
Can't help but feel insecure
She'll never stop, the way to the top
Is more than she had bargained for

Her quest for the glory was real
But somehow it turned out all wrong
Heartache was never a part of the dream
Can't find a reason to keep on trying

Turn out the light, 'cause deep in the night
She's like the thousands before
Hold out your hand, there's hope at the end
But be careful what you wish for

Now the lights are all gone
You find yourself on your own
Welcome the night 'cause not all that glitters is gold

Now the city has gone
You find your own way back home
Keep up the fight and you'll find your Kingdom of Gold

Another night out on the streets
Finding a way to survive
Wasting your chances, destroying your dreams
Counting the tears that you cry

Hiding the pain, it drives you insane
But still you're craving for more
So give me your hand, hold on 'til the end
And you can have what you wish for

Now the lights are all gone
You find yourself on your own
Welcome the night 'cause not all that glitters is gold

Now the city has gone
You find your own way back home
Keep up the fight and you'll find your Kingdom of Gold

Now the lights are all gone
You find yourself on your own
Welcome the night 'cause not all that glitters is gold

Now the lights are all gone
You find yourself on your own
Welcome the night 'cause not all that glitters is gold

Now the city has gone
You find your own way back home
Keep up the fight and you'll find your Kingdom of Gold

10. Ring Of Fire
[originally by Johnny Cash]Love is a burning thing
And it makes a fiery ring
Bound by a wild desire
And I fell right into a great ring of fire

And I fell into a burning ring of fire
I went down, down, down as the flames were rising higher
And it burns, burns, burns,
And it burns, burns, burns,
In a ring of fire

The taste of love is sweet
When hearts just like ours meet
I fell for you like a child
But I jumped right in and the fire went wild

When I fell into a burning ring of fire
I went down, down, down as the flames were rising higher
And it burns, burns, burns,
And it burns, burns, burns,
In a ring of fire

Love is a burning thing
And it makes a fiery ring
Bound by a wild desire
And I fell right into a great ring of fire

And I fell into a burning ring of fire
I went down, down, down as the flames were rising higher
And it burns, burns, burns,
And it burns, burns, burns,
In a ring of fire

11. Power And Glory
[Special Edition Bonus Track]A black cloud now falls on this city
But under the lights
Been searching for answers but this time, you
You feel so alive

Just free your own mind, it's not easy
To give all you've got
'Cause no one can stop you from climbing this mountain
And making the top

Run, strive for the fame
Blood of the game, that we play time and again
It's up to you to break these chains

Reasons to live, reasons to die
Live for the power and glory
Never give up, reach for the top
Find your own path and tonight we'll make it
Reasons to live, reasons to die
Live for the power and glory
Never give up, reach for the top
Find your own path and tonight we'll make it
All right

Now everyone wants to be something
A feeling so strong
But only one thing really matters
A place to belong

Don't spend all your days in the shadows
You're not on your own
But just keep on fighting
'Cause you'll never know you've got 'til it's gone

Run, strive for the fame
Blood of the game, that we play time and again
It's up to you to break these chains

Reasons to live, reasons to die
Live for the power and glory
Never give up, reach for the top
Find your own path and tonight we'll make it
Reasons to live, reasons to die
Live for the power and glory
Never give up, reach for the top
Find your own path and tonight we'll make it
All right

All right

12. You're Not Alone
[Special Edition Bonus Track]Emptiness, tears inside,
On the night before she died
Strong the fire that burns so bright inside of me

Through the years, through it all,
You touched my heart you touched my soul.
Never gave up the fight but tonight you'll be free.

All the tears in my own heart beating.
But I want you to know.

High the mountain we must climb
So far beyond the ocean's tide
We're torn apart but soon we'll all be home.
And our hearts forevermore entwined
We'll save the night we said goodbye,
No matter where you are, you're not alone.

Long nights on a road we cry
Cold thoughts of a brighter time.
An empty picture in an empty frame
Won't you take me away?

All the pain through my own life's end.
'Til the end of our days.

High the mountain we must climb
So far beyond the ocean's tide
We're torn apart but soon we'll all be home.
And our hearts forevermore entwined.
We'll save the night we said goodbye.
No matter where you are, you're not alone.

High the mountain we must climb so far beyond the ocean's tide.
We're torn apart but soon we'll all be home.
High the mountain we must climb so far beyond the ocean's tide.
We're torn apart but soon we'll all be home.
And our hearts forevermore entwined
We'll save the night we said goodbye.

No matter where you are, you're not alone...

13. Chemical Interference
[Special Edition Bonus Track]Another night, another inner fight
The demon's calling
My soul is dark, but with a touch of light
The whole world's changing

I draw the line, the pleasure redefined
It's now awakening
I feel the urge, emotions on the verge
And now it's time to kill

The speed of light, I feel the time is right
I've smashed all boundaries
A skull crushed, adrenaline rush
The night has found me

Infection spreads, a spirit through my head
The time is coming
I know the score, but I gotta have one more
And for more I could kill

I am what I choose to be, I lose grip on reality
And I have nothing to atone
All your morals thrown in vain, I know my pleasure is my pain
But I'm gonna make it on my own

The sun is up, but I can't get enough
The sky's the limit
I'm on the top, but I ain't gonna stop
I'll never give in

It's in my brain, it's driving me insane
Hallucinations
Always the same, but I ain't gonna save
Destruction, I must kill

I am what I choose to be, I lose grip on reality
And I have nothing to atone
All your morals thrown in vain, I know my pleasure is my pain
But I'm gonna make it on my own

I've seen the sun rise once again
I've lived my life and now I'm dead
Time to come down all on my own

This is nothing new for me
This is my reality
So open your eyes and don't ever hide away

I am what I choose to be, I lose grip on reality
And I have nothing to atone
All your morals thrown in vain, I know my pleasure is my pain
But I'm gonna make it on my own

14. Summer's End
[Japanese Bonus Track]Sometimes we play, sometimes we lose
With pride or with shame
Sometimes a dream turns into dust
But who's there to blame?

Try not to forget, and to understand
And read between the lines
Get back on your feet, you've got one more chance
To make it right this time

The reason we stand
Facing the rising sun the pain goes on and on
We hold deep inside the power to guide us until we touch the sky

The reason we stand with pride
Is the will to live and to reach for the stars
So never look back and we'll keep on fighting until we touch the sky

Sometimes the pain burns deep inside
And all seems in vain
Sometimes the fear darkens the path
And leads us astray

Tears in our eyes and our hopes are fading away
But revenge is sweet, get back on your feet
'Cause a war is upon us today

The reason we stand
Facing the rising sun the pain goes on and on
We hold deep inside the power to guide us until we touch the sky

The reason we stand with pride
Is the will to live and to reach for the stars
So never look back, you're always just one step away

[Solo]

The reason we stand
Facing the rising sun the pain goes on and on
We hold deep inside the power to guide us until we touch the sky

The reason we stand with pride
Is the will to live and to reach for the stars
So never look back, and we'll keep fighting until we touch the sky

(The reason we stand)
The reason we stand
(Facing the rising sun the pain goes on and on)
Pain goes on and on
(We hold deep inside the power to fighting until we touch the sky)
Fighting until we touch the sky

(Ah will to live and to reach for the stars)
The power we hold deep inside until we touch the sky
One step away!

Just one step away!
Touch the sun
Touch the sun
Touch the sun

15. Fight To Be Free
[Special Edition Bonus Track]
[originally by Shadow Warriors]Coming down from the mountain ranges
For the battle of ancient ages
Fight hard for the warrior soul
Wage war, ride on 'til our destiny calls

Through the valley of black wind, burning sun
See the warrior fight, the time has come
Fight on for the powerful Lord
March on, stand strong 'til the end of the world

When the sun and stars will align again
And the land is dark and gone
And the ring of fire will be born again
For the one

We just want to dream about it
We die to believe without it
The fire in our hearts, in our song
The price at the gates far beyond

And when the hands of all the nation will arise
And as the sun will shine across the blazing skies
Through the wind and through the trees
For the honor of family, black ninja ride on
Fight to be free

For our fallen fathers we will fight
For the glory of master through the night
Over mountains, by the sea
To the land far away where the warrior lives
See the ninja ride with evil sword
For the power of powerful overlord
March on for the glory of all
Ride on, fight hard for the warrior call

When the sun and stars will align again
And the land is dark and gone
And the ring of fire will be born again
For the one

We just want to dream about it
We die to believe without it
The fire in our hearts, in our song
The price at the gates far beyond

When the sun and stars will align again
And the land is dark and gone
And the ring of fire will be born again
For the one

We just want to dream about it
We die to believe without it
The fire in our hearts, in our song
The price at the gates far beyond

And when the hands of all the nation will arise
And as the sun will shine across the blazing skies
Through the wind and through the trees
For the honor of family, black ninja ride on
Fight to be free

1. Through The Fire And The Flames
On a cold winter morning, in the time before the light
In flames of death's eternal reign we ride towards the fight
When the darkness has fallen down, and the times are tough all right
The sound of evil laughter falls around the world tonight

Fighting hard, fighting on for the steel, through the wastelands evermore
The scattered souls will feel the hell bodies wasted on the shores
On the blackest plains in hell's domain, we watch them as we go
In fire and pain, and once again we know

So now we fly ever free
We're free before the thunderstorm
On towards the wilderness our quest carries on
Far beyond the sundown, far beyond the moonlight
Deep inside our hearts and all our souls

[Chorus:]
So far away we wait for the day
For the lives all so wasted and gone
We feel the pain of a lifetime lost in a thousand days
Through the fire and the flames we carry on

As the red day is dawning
And the lightning cracks the sky
We'll raise our hand to the heavens above
With resentment in their eyes
Running back from the mid-morning light
With a burning in my heart
We're banished from a time in a fallen land
To a life beyond the stars

In your darkest dreams see to believe
Our destiny is time
And endlessly we'll all be free tonight

And on the wings of a dream, so far beyond reality
All alone in desperation, now the time has come
Lost inside you'll never find, lost within my own mind
Day after day this misery must go on

[Chorus]

[Solos: Twin/Sam/Twin/Herman/Twin/Herman/Sam/Herman/Sam]

Now here we stand with their blood on our hands
We fought so hard now can we understand
I'll break the seal of this curse if I possibly can
For freedom of every man

[Chorus]

2. Revolution Deathsquad
Flying over darkened skies the battle will call
Distant angels crying in the eye of the storm
And the world falls under the starlight shining from heavens below
Long years of pain and sorrow searching for more
Cry for the touch of angels never before
And the stars fall on the horizon onwards and up through the pain

Ride the wind and fight the demon steel shining bright
Standing together forever onwards flames burning strong
Hot wind in hell of pain and sorrow now and ever onwards
We stare into the dawn of a new world

[Pre-chorus]
Cry out for the fallen heroes
Lost in time ago
In our minds they still belong
When the sands of time are gone

[Chorus]
Rise over shadow mountains blazing with power
Crossing valleys endless tears in unity we stand
Far and wide across the land the victory is ours
On towards the gates of reason
Fight for the truth and the freedom
Gloria

Searching through the memories to open the door
Living on the edge of life like never before
And the ground chants under the moonlight facing their fears all the same

Heavens fear now open wide and up for the the call
All in stark reality the angels will fall
And the world cries out for the silence lost in the voices unknown

Blinded by the force of evil cries into the night
Never before have they seen the darkness now they are all gone
Out from the shadows storming on the wings of revelations
Your soul will feel no mercy come the dawn

Hold on for the morning after
Never to let go
In the fire's burning strong
When the tides of time roll on

[Chorus]

[Solos: Herman/Twin/Sam/Herman/Twin/Twin Blast/Herman/Sam/Herman/Sam]

[Pre-chorus]

[Chorus]

Gloria
Gloria

3. Storming The Burning Fields
Bursting through the fires avenging
Fatal warning battles are raging
Power of darkness rise for the fight
We'll be strong and stand our ground

Death is all around us and my heart is beating weaker
Fight the day with power of immortal souls arise
Fire in our hearts the evil rages on forever more
Burning until the battle rage is gone

Through damnation we rise sign of the times master of bleeding eyes
Thunder and high look to the sky you never gonna take us down!

[Chorus]
And we will crush the evil standing on the temple in the fire storming
Fly beyond the lost horizons high
Heroes of the night are calling
See the promised land is falling
Reaching for the powers deep inside
On through the night

Blinded by the hate and desire
Burning in your heart like a fire
Challenging all the suffer and fear our horizons take control
Blood spills all around us and our enemies draw nearer
Sacrifice your life to have them carry you away
Take us to the place of death and carry on forever more
Burning on the dreams of memories long gone!

And you'll die for your crimes sign of the times master of endless lies
Fight to the end now we ascend together we will take them down

[Chorus]

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Solos: Herman/Sam/Herman/Sam]

[Chorus]

4. Operation Ground And Pound
Smashing through the boundaries
Storming through the burning fields
Stand before the evil one on towards the morning sun
Falling under skies of pain

Still we're searching endlessly
Crashing over seven seas
Torturing the winter skies riding over plains of ice
Shadows in the fields of the slain!

Crashing steel and raging fury smash the quest destroy their army
Crush the legions of the twilight, templars of steel will burn

Cry far away as we reach for the day
Blasting our way through the punishment and the pain
Reach for the world as the sky begins to fall
Rising through the darkened ashes praying that I'll see you all

[Chorus:]
Far away will our eyes now see the day
For today, the everlasting eternal sun
Washed away the dreams of a brighter day
Forever hold the dream inside the chance to fight another fight
The breaking hearts that stand for all our lives
Live tonight

Watch you die I watch you die inside while fear controls your life
And reject this animosity that killed so many minds
You feel the power deep within the fear you hold inside
Just to find the reason for the treason now you will be mine

Screams of pain in death descending rise again from hell defending
Burn their hearts within the fire, warriors of light will be slain

Rise through the pain like the sun will rise again
Day after day but the memories never change
Stand before the storm as the last horizon falls
Blinded by the vision and the innocence of our souls

[Chorus]

[Solos: Sam/Herman/Sam]

Far away will our eyes now see the day
For today the everlasting eternal sun

[Chorus]

WO...

[Solo: Herman]

5. Body Breakdown
Silent screams and shattered dreams of what we left at seventeen
Still lost within the misery and pain that lies inside
Here alone the fight to breathe still searching for the truth to be
Blackened by the burning fire held deep inside my mind!

Far beyond the lost horizon standing on the shore
Across the seas their hearts will bleed this life we're waiting for
Taste the steel in pain you kneel for glory we defend
Our fallen souls will rise to fight again!

Stay here with me this night we'll be together
Future in our hands we'll fight with freedom drawing near
Stand here with me for we will live forever
Tonight we stand and face it all

Falling rain will hide the pain that lies beneath the burning flames
All hope is gone so carry on before the world will fall
Rise again to die in vain now life can never be the same
Our own salvation drawing nearer hear the darkness call

Skies are falling thunder storming stand before the world
We're banished now to barren wastelands fight the demon whore
Riding on through blackened darkness cross the endless sands
We sail away our victory at hand!

Stay here with me together we'll be stronger
Side by side we've conquered lands and stormed across the seas

Die here with me we feel this pain no longer
For now and ever we will be

[Chorus:]
In my heart, in my soul, I am out of control
Fly across the mountains and towards the distant sun
Tears evermore we cry like before
Feel the breakdown of my body - set me free

[Solo: Sam]

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Solo: Herman / Sam / Vadim]

[Super Bridge]

[Solo: Sam/Vadim/Herman]

In my heart in my soul I am out of control
Fly across the mountains and towards the distant sun
Tears evermore, we cry like before
Feel the breakdown of my body
In my heart in my soul I am out of control
Fly across the mountains and towards the distant sun
Tears evermore, we cry like before
Feel the breakdown of my body
Feel the breakdown of my body
Set me free

6. Cry For Eternity
Falling from the sky now, the sign of the burning sun
Into the face of the evil one
Nowhere to hide now we're on the run right before your eyes

We're watching, we're waiting, our souls are forsaken
The sign of the warriors, the evil will rise

Through the fire and the flames, breaking the chains
Into the night we go
Torment and pain trample the slain
Soldiers of death we know

[Pre-chorus]
Our steel will shine forever through the night and blinding rain!
We'll see them face their fears; it's time to rise again in everlasting pain

[Chorus]
Fly free for what we believe
One thousands hearts bleeding the eternal dream
Feel me the touch we all need
So silently now we will kneel
Cry for eternity

See now the fallen will live again
They feel the pain burn inside of them
Remember now what you feel again deep down inside
Still cursing still crawling we're endlessly falling
The downfall of mankind the fate of us all

Hold your hands to the sky bleed and you cry
Screaming until we know
Dying in pain again and again
Onwards to hell below

Stand strong we'll live together raging through the barren lands
Our eyes have seen the sorrow far across the sands
The power in our hands

[Chorus]

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Solos: Sam/Sam/Sam/Herman/Herman]

Fly far away to the end of our days
The voices of long distant cries
Now we remain in this labyrinth of pain
And so we ride into the night

[Pre-chorus]

[Chorus]

Cry for eternity

[Solos: Sam/Herman]

7. The Flame Of Youth
Close your eyes hear the thunder and rain
Fear inside of the torturing pain
For the cries of the world and the last lives remain

Chain your heart swear to die for their gain
Deep inside slowly fading away
And the last breathe remains and the fear turns to rage

Locked in a world by the fallen evil souls
Torn right apart for your life insane
Burning in my mind now to bring my life to hold
Reach out and die in the flames
See through the lies and their ever staring eyes
Now is the time to defend your ground
Destiny will call to remind us all now
Fly free so far from here
This life we know will end
In dreams of everlasting pain
The fallen now rise again

Through the fire, through the flames Like the sun will rise again
Lost in time
Lost in space
To the end of all their days

See their endless ways insanity
The quest deranged not meant to be
In flames will now forever burn eternally

[Chorus]
So free your heart leave your life far behind
In the cold of winter skies escape the pain inside
Now feel your soul lost in seas of all eternity
Everyday this life, defending and the flames of youth not ending
In a lifetime, searching, we must fight through the eternal pain

So alone in the world far away,
memories of a dream will remain
As the world's falling cold and our lives all in vain

Fire in my soul will forever rise again
Nothing in my mind to remember now
Broken by the fear of the dark night calling
Ride free on endless seas
The final curtain falls
Cut the ground from down below
The time to lock and to load

Through the fire, through the rain,
far across the distant plains
Feel the wind beneath the steel
as your mind becomes insane
Save the pain from all humanity,
their rides trough our destiny
For freedom now we rise for all again

[Chorus]

[Solos: Herman/Sam/Vadim/Herman/Sam]

So free your heart leave your life far behind
In the cold of winter skies escape the pain inside
And when the memories are all but left behind
And the days have gone forever, lost within my mind
Now feel your soul burn in seas of all eternity
Every day of this life defending and the flames of youth not ending
In a lifetime searching we must fight through the eternal pain

We fight through the eternal pain

8. Trail Of Broken Hearts
Here we are far beyond the distant sky
Seen all the world and how the story will be over
Through the snow and tainted mountains we have climbed
Now we have found the light that guides us over
Through the fallen rain we travelled far and wide
And through the blackest darkness
Stars above shining bright

Through the sun and winter rain will fall
All our lives we all were waiting for a sign to call
We're walking hand in hand in dreams and endless time
How do we know when we will leave this life behind?

Stare at life through eyes of mine
the hate the fear and the pain
There's a feeling held deep inside - when life you live is in vain

[Chorus]
Fly away down the lonely roads of yesterday
We close your eyes to see the light of brighter days
And all alone we'll be where time can never heal
With the trail of broken hearts flying free

Once again we walk this lonely road
There are times that we are wading through the rain and cold
We're lost in memories of what we left behind
Relive the dreams, the endless screams of pain inside

Lives are filled with emptiness
The fear returned once again
Searching endlessly you cannot see
Drown your mind in the pain

[Chorus]

The last temptation will be all that's left for me

When I see those tears you cry
When I hear those lies you lie
When I see your creation now falling down on me
Is this the reason to be?

[Solos: Sam/Herman/Sam]

[Chorus]

The trail of broken hearts flying free

9. Lost Souls In Endless Time
[Bonus Track]

Spend all our lives
On what we believe in
Struggle day by day
But never retrieving
Taking our chances
And follow the footsteps
Ancestors will take us to this fight
At the time it was blistering snowing

Never really know about
Where we were going
Time is coming now
To cross over
Here and now until
The curtain lowers

Slaying all the evil down below
Onwards we ride now
To what we know
Strong enough to stay
And carry on forever
Brace your soul
To fight whenever

Never know how far we travelled
We will have our stand
Across the deepest oceans
Gold is in our hands
Good things will come
For those who wait we can't deny
Still the battle raging and the fire burns inside

Take you with me, we will fly across the sea
To the land of the sun where our journeys begun
All fear is gone, we sail until the dawn
Deepest fears will burn inside your mind
For the souls lost in endless time

Searching never ending
For the chaos ascending
You forgot the spirits
All times pretending
Passing shades of darkness
In the world around you
Finally insanity
In death has found you.

On the edge of life
Trying to pull you under
Deep inside the storm
There's a raging thunder
Sacrifice your innocence
For persecution
As we now prepare
For the revolution

Slaying all the evil down below
Onwards we ride now
To what we know
Strong enough to stay
And carry on forever
Brace your soul
To fight whenever

In a time of fire we're searching
Blind inside the mind
Run away to hell's damnation
One day we will find
Suddenly the skies are falling
Too late for us all
Crashing down on all creation
As the towers fall

Take you with me, we will fly across the sea
To the land of the sun where our journeys begun
All fear is gone, we sail until the dawn
Deepest fears will burn inside your mind
For the souls lost in endless time

[Solos: Vadim / Key Blast]

Stand Before the worlds of freedom
Rise above them all
Ride towards the battle raging
Victory behold
Blackened Steel of death tonight
Our legions now descend
Far Beyond the gates of glory
Time to rise again

[Solos: Sam / Herman / Sam / Herman]

Take you with me, we will fly across the sea
To the land of the sun where our journeys begun
All fear is gone, we sail until the dawn
Deepest fears will burn inside your mind

Take you with me, we will fly across the sea
To the land of the sun where our journeys begun
All fear is gone, we sail until the dawn
Deepest fears will burn inside your mind

For the souls lost in endless time
For the souls lost in endless time
For the souls lost in endless time
