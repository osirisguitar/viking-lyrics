1. Valhalla
Winds of Odin guide us
Over violent seas, the silent grave 
Gods of thunder
Roaring, crackling power
In flashing light, they pound the night

Rising winds and howling fury
Towering shadows crashing down

As we awaken and behold 
The crystal seas and ships of gold 
To the colored winds our sails arise 
The distant shore before us lies 
Winds of Odin whisper 
Over silent waves, no trace remains

We have found a new horizon 
Far beyond the stars that shine above 
Thrashing wings valkyries rising
To the hollowed halls of Valhalla

Valhalla, Valhalla

Valhalla, Valhalla
Valhalla, Valhalla

2. Dragon Lady
The full moon is burning
In the crimson sky
A wicked witches laughter
Echoes in the night
The wolves of doom howl
A warning to the wind
Red eyes of fire
Haunting your dreams again

Watch out her poison heart
She's a dragon lady
Look into her crystal ball
It tells all 
Watch out now she's breathing fire
She's a dragon lady
Look into her crimson eyes
Say good-bye!

Watch out her poison heart
She's a dragon lady
Look into her crystal ball
It tells all 
Watch out now she's breathing fire
She's a dragon lady
Look into her crimson eyes
Say good-bye!

Dragon lady wants to meet you
Step into her lair
Death waits in the shadows
Enter the fire and challenge the witch
If you dare
Enter the fire and challenge the witch
If you dare
No, no, no, no

Watch out her poison heart
She's a dragon lady
Look into her crystal ball
It tells all 
Watch out now she's breathing fire
She's a dragon lady
Look into her crimson eyes
You shall die!

She's a dragon lady

Watch out
Dragon lady wants to meet you

3. Heart of Steel
Your love hides like a dark star
Shining, hidden in fear
Strangers feeding upon your soul
Call me on through the darkness
Hold me deep in your heaven
Touch me with fingers of velvet blue
Fingers of mysty blue...
Feelings deep as the ocean 
Cold waves whisper their warning
Danger walks with a fragile heart

Got to have a heart of steel 
Heart of steel
Yeah, heart of steel

You journey through my mind 
Over the walls of pain
Angels of lust guard my domain 
While dark eyes shine in the mirror 
Searching for someone 
Strangers, cold as the winter wind
Fade away 

Got to have a heart of steel
Heart of steel
Got to have a heart of steel
Heart of steel Lonely freedom, eyes on pain
Tears will fall like silent rain
Hearts will shatter, feelings fade
Somehow it always seems the same 

My love hides like a dark star
Laughing, hidden in silence
Strangers cold as the winter wind
Fade away
Feelings deep as the ocean 
Cold waves whisper their warning
Danger walks with a fragile heart
Walks with a fragile heart 

Got to have a heart of steel
Heart of steel
Got to have a heart of steel
Heart of steel

Cause the feelings come and go
And you never really know 
If th eling's ever real
So you got to have a heart of steel
v You got to have a heart of steel

4. Azrael
Never been in the hell before
Now I'm falling, falling
Heaven's behind the door
And they're calling me again
Hidden beyond the light
And the darkness finds me
Help me escape tonight 
Oh, I must find Azrael...

I am the darkness
Hiding within your mind
Walking beside you

I lock the gates to hell
I toll the final bell
I am forever

I am the blinding light
Probing the endless night
There's no escaping me

Wake in your darkest dreams 
Go ahead and try to scream
No one can hear you now

Stare in the raven's eye
Your time has come to die
Welcome to my world

Stand at the end of space
Reach out to touch my face
I am omega

Azrael

I hold the lion's mane
I come in crimson rain
Purging the dark sky

I am the master 
Guide to your chosen fate
I am Valhalla

Azrael, angel of mercy
Azrael, angel of mercy
Yeah

Beware my eyes'll find you
And see into your heart
And if you hold the evil
I'll rip you all apart
I'll cast your soul to Satan
Die by holy fire
Rise and stand before me
Burning on the pyre. Burn.

Fly on the wings of glory 
Burn in the depths of hell
Your life creates the doorway
Death holds the key

Azrael, angel of mercy
Azrael, angel of mercy
Azrael, angel of mercy
Azrael, angel of mercy
Yeah

5. Mayday
Countdown to zero, ignition
Warning
Rising in smoke, glowing fire

Thrusting into the sky of the morning
Warning
All system down

Mayday!
Mayday!
Mayday!
Mayday!

In search of the glory
They reach for the stars
With honor and courage
They die!

Mayday!
Mayday!
Mayday!
Mayday!

Thunderous roar of the engine
Screaming
They fill the sky, burn trails

Down through the clouds falling faster
Disaster 
Taking their lives

Mayday!
Mayday!
Mayday!
Mayday!

6. Queen of the Masquerade
Woman - madame of mystery
Heavens anger, devils daughter
Lady - black widow strange and cruel
Is it true?

Do you still need hearts to bleed
To be satisfied?
Gathering prey, deadly webs
Hang in dark disguise
Showing no mercy, insatiable appetite
Down, down to your knees
Bow before her majesty

Hail - to the queen of the masquerade
Deep in your heart she feeds
Hail - to the queen of the masquerade
Bow to her majesty

Look out

Slowly, crawling feeding on your heart
So many kings with broken dreams, 
The tyrants rule, the dragon pleads
Tell you man she'll tear you all apart 
In chambers of the wicked queen 
The silence falls, the feast begins

Moon-shining eyes, clinging cobwebs
Above her bed
Spider smooth legs across faces
On silken web
Feeling the sting of her venomous
Clinching bite
Down, down to your knees
Bow before her majesty

Hail - to the queen of the masquerade
Deep in your heart she feeds
Hail - to the queen of the masquerade
Bow to her majesty

Her majesty queen

Do you still need hearts to bleed
To be satisfied?
Gathering prey, deadly webs
Hang in dark disguise
Showing no mercy, insatiable appetite
Down, down to your knees
Bow before her majesty

Hail - to the queen of the masquerade 
Deep in your heart she feeds
Hail - to the queen of the masquerade
Bow to her majesty
Hail - to the queen of the masquerade
Deep in your heart she feeds
Hail - to the queen of the masquerade
Bow to her majesty
Hail - to the queen of the masquerade
Hard in your heart that bleeds
Hail...

8. Lost Reflections
Locked in this attic 
Been here so many years
Shanna won't set me free
She says I'm evil 
But then she doesn't know 
I'm not pretending, no, not me

Full moon's reflecting
A face in the mirror 
Twisted and bleeding
No, you can't be real, no you're 
All in my mind
Shades of insanity, you're not me
You're not me

Life in the attic
I like my rocking chair
Staring in shadows
Crouched in the corner
Waiting for something
Laughing at nothing
No one there

And on and on I wonder is there more 
What is life beyond the attic door 
The full moon in my eyes 
Is all that's real 
The mirror's lost reflection is in me

Life in the attic
Life in the attic
Life in the attic
Life in the attic

Cobwebs and dusty dreams 
Sharp knives and hollow screams 
Wide eyes of terror 
Clawing the attic door 
Can't take it anymore
You better go away!

You're lyin'
Hurry
Ah, ah, ah, ah
Who's there?
No one there
You're not me!

1. Lady of Winter
Her wraith rides the crystal sky
of changing colors
The glowing clouds are moving through
the winter night
Snow is falling silver shining
Through the shadows deep blue dreaming
eyes of diamond shine
Lady of winter, turning to rain
White world of wonder, fading away
Bright beams of violent light
break the silence
Melting colors crushed beneath the waves
of rolling flames
Seasons turning, burning burning
Lady of winter, song in the wind
Melody whispers, seasons will change
Lady of winter, turning to rain
White world of wonder, fading away
Lady of winter, song in the wind
Melody whispers, seasons will change

2. Red Sharks
Trapped in their world no free passage to leave
You accept their tyrannical dream
You pray to their gods not to your chosen ones
Freedom's clutched in the jaw of red kings
Give us your freedom, we'll give you hell
Hear no evil, see no evil, speak no evil
Give us your freedom, we'll give you hell
Hear no evil, see no evil, speak no evil
Glory to red sharks
Answer to your red dictators
Feeding from your dreams
Cast into a sea of red sharks
Holding the power a hand that grips fate
Stripping from you all but fear
Hovering vultures like demons feed
On all who bow to their communist scheme
Give us your freedom, we'll give you hell
Hear no evil, see no evil, speak no evil
Give us your freedom, we'll give you hell
Hear no freedom, see no freedom, speak no freedom
Glory to red sharks
Answer to your red dictators
Feeding from your dreams
Cast into a sea of red sharks
Bloody red sharks

3. Painted Skies
When she's sad the world is lonely
Silver clouds are crying only
for the pain she feels
so deep inside
The love she thought would save her
has somehow now enslaved her
To a dream she though she wanted
to come true
Spread your wings you can fly
But the dove is never free
In painted skies that shade the color
of your dream
Only nightmares are real
Confusion conceals the only reason
for the feelings you can't hide
When she smiles the world it shimes
But the silver clouds are only there
to hide the distant storm
that's coming soon
The love she let surround her
has become the waves that drown her
in the sea of everchaning
warmth and cold
Spread your wings you can fly
But the dove is never free
In painted skies that shade the color
of your dream
Only nightmares are real
Confusion conceals the only reason
for the feelings you can't hide
You can fly
Spread your wings you can fly
But the dove is never free
In painted skies that shade the color
of your dream
Only nightmares are real
Confusion conceals the only reason
for the feelings you can't hide
When the nightmares ensue
All that you can do is paint your sky
another brighter shade of blue
Spread your wings you can glide
above the violent storms
that plague your life
You paint the picture blue or grey
Fly away

4. Masque of the Red Death
The pain lingers on beyond these castle walls
The red death is taking them all
while the king and his court dance the night away
at the masquerade
The hour of midnight grows near
Masque of the red death
No one is safe from the poisonous plague
that you breed
Dance while you may in the dark of the room
with the stranger
Laugh while you may, laugh at the danger
Is the a message from god
or fate guiding hideous hands?
Won't you show us your face
Masque of the red death
No one is safe from the poisonous plague
that you breed
Masque of the red death
No one is saved, no one remembers your name
On and on, one by one we fall
into the bleeding arms of the stranger
Ripping the masque from your face
I feel your disease running
through my veins
A new king of death threatens us all
Masque of the red death
No one is safe from the poisonous plague
that you breed
Masque of the red death
The price that you pay for your lust
may be your life

5. In Dark Places
Waves pound the gloomy shores, I watch them roll
across my feet so warm
I know she's waiting there for me
In ancient rhymes she whispers in the wind
a strange and haunting melody
As it fills the silence, I feel the shivers cold
embrace my soul
From the deep she beckons me
promising eternity
In a world where nothing's real
beyond this realm of light and dreams
You, mystic moon it's you who rules the night
breathing life into my dreams
I see your face in nightmares shining bright
So, it's fare to you my sunlit world
so full of hate and misery
You see I can't take it anymore
From my sleep you beckon me
promising eternity
In your world of mystery
to your realm of harmony
In dark places
In dark places we will be
forever beyond the light
In dark places we will be free
from the pain that fills our lives
Through arching moonbeams of light we glide
in bending shadows of warm starlight
Angels of colors light the night as they fly
transcending into the electric sky
In dark places
In dark places we will be
forever beyond the light
In dark places we will be free
from the pain that fills our lives
In dark places we will be
forever beyond the light
In dark places we will see
worlds we've always dreamed

6. Where Dragons Rule
The dragons rise from the sea of flames
Through the night you can hear them marching
breathing fire, wings of steel
By the thousands they take to the sky
shadow us all
In a world
Where dragons rule
All across the sky they soar
burning trails into the night
Laser eyes gleaming death~ seek and destroy
Like shooting stars they fall from the sky
Death from above
In a world between myth and strange reality
In a world where dragons rule
Mission: Kill
We kill for the dragon~ We have no reason
Mission: Kill
We die for the dragon~ Is there a reason?
March!
Where dragons rule

7. Lonely
She awakens from a dream to a silent room
where shadows speak of memories
Another sleepless night,
afraid to face the day
It seems so long ago she shared the love
she feels so deep inside
Her love will never die
but still she feels so lonely...
Lonely in Love
She wakes up to another day
with everything going wrong
She wonders where she would be
if she had ever seen his face
She turns on the radio,
but it's playing that same old song
She's pouring another drink
to drown away the memory of it all
She can't wait another night
Take another day
She doesn't want to be
Lonely in Love
There's a feeling she can't explain
that no one can understand
She just needs to get away
but there's nowhere that she can go
Tomorrow's so far away
She's longing for yesterday
If she could just turn back time
She wants to leave the world behind
She can't wait another night
Take another day
She doesn't want to be
Lonely in Love
The night will fade, the sun will shine
a new day
And light the way for you to find
New Love

8. Burning Bridges
We've all been hurt before
you know the pain
And just to love is not enough
So many times I've had to turn away
from love I know could be so true to me
Now I stand alone in my dark and lonely world
surrounded by this cold embrace of jealousy
No feeling remains, like a restless heart
naked in the frozen winds of sorrow
Now I feel the bridges burning
Flames reflecting in my eyes
The feeling much too cold to share
Another broken heart to spare
Smoke clouds dreams I've left behind
I never meant to bring you sorrow
I never meant to cause you pain
I know how much it burns so deep inside
It's burning me too
Leave me silent in the morning light
Hold me close until the morning comes again
I need you so bad
Tell me lies if truth reveals your love
Feel the flames are rising
The bridge is falling, the bridge is burning
I never knew that I would need you
I always thought you would be there
Now I feel the bridges burning
Flames reflecting in my eyes
I never meant to bring you sorrow
I never meant to cause you pain
Still thinking of you
You know I love you... still

9. Eternal World
Down through the valley of shadows we go
into the canyon of moonlight below
Stairs of stone descending
Down where the magic river's bending
Down the river we go
To the sea of gold
(Where?) things are not as they seem
(Why?) you are not as you were
Behold eternal world
where time has no meaning
reality is dreaming
Feel your flesh is melting
Feel you spirit twisting
Feel it ripping at your mind
There's no time for praying
Feel your soul is pleading
Welcome to eternal world

10. Transcendence
The snow was gently falling
A white mist filled the air
I hear the cold wind calling
Something's waiting there
I stand alone in silence
upon the mountain high
I'm waiting for the spirits
Eyes upon the sky
They whisper in my visions
They haunt me in my dreams
They've shown me worlds that shimmer
and peaceful fields of green
Try to find you sky
Your world within yourself
In death I've found the answer
In death I've found the answer
In death I live again
Fear not the reaper's blade
It does not mean the end
It never really ends

1. Strange and Beautiful
Dark eyes shine with strange desire
Velvet cold skin tastes like fire
Something in her eyes
Make you need to be inside her
Something in her twisted smile
Sends shivers down my spine
Round and round and down she goes
Where she stops nobody really knows
Love to her is pain to you
Tell you man she's strange and beautiful
Take it easy baby now you love is killing me
Your love is killing me
You can feel her deep inside
But you will never come to understand her
Round and round and down she goes
Where she stops nobody really knows
Love to her is pain to you
Tell you man she's strange and beautiful
Wicked and wonderful
Dark eyes shine with a strange desire
Velvet cold skin tastes like fire
Strange and beautiful
Strange and beautiful
Round and round and down she goes
Where she stops nobody really knows
Love to her is pain to you
Tell you man she's strange and beautiful
Cold eyes burn with a dark desire
Velvet strange skin tastes like fire
Ladies and gentlemen welcome one and all
Come see the lady of your dreams
The show's about to start
Round and round and down she goes
Where she stops nobody really knows
Love to her is just a game
Tell you man she's strange
Strange and beautiful
Strange and beautiful

2. Promise Land

3. Love and Dreams
You are the shining, I am the star
You are the burning, I am the fire
Burning bright for all to see
Forever together I know we'll be
Take my hand lady walk with me
Through these fields of love and dreams
You and I were meant to be together
Two hearts will beat as one forever
You and I were meant to be
Forever together I know we'll be
Spread your wings lady fly with me
Across the sky of love and dreams
Your love is like the warmth of the fire
Fills my heart with a burning desire
To give my love to you
You are my dream, you are my lady
You are the only one in my life
You are my heaven, you are my baby
You are the shining light
You are the sun
Shine on, shine on me
Shine on, shine on me
Two ships passing in the night
Have found each other in the light
Close your eyes now drift away with me
Across the sea of love and dreams
You are my dream, you are my lady
You are the only one in my life
You are my heaven, you are my baby
You are the shining light
You are the sun
Shine on, shine on me
Shine on, shine on me

4. The Chant
In the daytime and in the night
I hear The Chant coming from all around me
Like a blind man who never had his sight
Wishing he could see the light
Desperate ways, desperate days
Are the times we're living in
Looking out, finding out
Realizing that we're living in the last days of living
Chanting around the world
I can hear the voices begging for mercy
Save us from our sins
Can you hear the voices begging for mercy
Through a window looking out to see
What's waiting for me
Destination I know the way
You can follow me
Desperate ways, desperate days
Are the times we're living in
Looking out, finding out
Realizing that we're living in the last days of living
Chanting around the world
I can hear the voices begging for mercy
Save us from our sins
Can you hear the voices begging for mercy
Desperate ways, desperate days
Are the times we're living in
Looking out, finding out
Realizing that we're living in the last days of living
Chanting around the world
I can hear the voices begging for mercy
Save us from our sins
Can you hear the voices begging for mercy

5. Dance on Fire
Alright, hold tight
Gonna take you for a ride
Inside the endless depths of my love
Inside outside
Through the doorways of your mind
Into the shadows of my soul
Ooh, something in the way you move that moves me
Ooh, something in the way you sway
The way you make love to me
Come dance with

6. Song for Angels
Innocence is fragile like the wind
Cold hearts can tear it down
It's hard to find some sanctuary
I know you're feelin' like the world
Is on your shoulders
And you won't survive if it gets any colder
Angels- wait for tomorrow
Before you smile you gotta cry sometimes
Angels- a new day will follow
Even angels need to learn how to fly
Liste close to the child inside you
Beggin' to be set free
you've lost your way
And your heart is needing shelter
I know you feel the walls are
Closing all around
Hold on, it won't be long
Before you break 'em down
Angels- wait for tomorrow
Before you smile you gotta cry sometimes
Angels- a new day will follow
Even angels need to learn how to fly
Believe in all you dreams
And reach for the sky
So hard all alone
Fightin' thru the pain
Some day you'll stand up
Straong and unafraid
And then you'll see the sun
Right behind the rain
Spread your wings
Angels- wait for tomorrow
Before you smile you gotta cry sometimes
Angels- a new day will follow
Even angels need to learn how to fly

7. In the Mood
You think you know me
I may look just like an ordinary man to you
But there's something about me
I think it's time you knew
I can see you don't believe in me
Well, well honey that's allright
Tonight you'll see... the real me
I change at night now, don't be afraid
It's just in the full moonlight
I rearrange
Don't run, can't hide, love bites hard tonight
Better lock the door to your heart
Don't scream, don't move let me get you in the mood
I need to taste your warm sweet love
Come dance with me my virgin child
To the haunting sound of my dark magic lullaby
let me show you how to feel the way I feel
Forevermore, look into my eyes
I can see you don't believe in me
Well, well honey that's allright
Tonight you'll believe
It's no fantasy, come closer to me
It's time to change now, don't be afraid
You'll find the pain will soon go away
Oh yes I can feel it coming on
At last the time has come
Oh yeah you're a sweet little sacrifice
In the name of love
Don't run, can't hide, love bites hard tonight
Better lock the door to your heart
Don't scream, don't move let me get you in the mood
I need to taste your warm sweet love
Can;t you feel the ecstasy
Soon you will belong to me
I'm right behind you all the time- run!!
Don't scream, don't move let me get you in the mood
Oh your sweet love tastes so good
I'm in the mood... again

8. Starchamber
Deep blue in ultraviolet
I'm the pilot of these stars
My world is in slow motion
Frozen ocean rain of fire
We make love
And as we do it's strange and violent
I feel you

9. Deep Inside Your Heart
She waits by the window
Counting the stars that fall
Silence becomes her only friend
As the nights grow long
Keep my love baby deep inside your heart
You know I don't want to leave you
But it's time to go
I'm always there babe by your side
Whenever we're apart
You know I love you evermore
I will be there by by your side
Deep inside your heart
I'll always love you
He looks through the window
Watching the city lights rushing by
His ears still ring as the engine
Whines into the sleepless night
Starlight, star bright, first star I see tonight
I wish I may, I wish I might
Be with you tonight
I'm always there babe by your side
Whenever we're apart
You know I love you evermore
I will be there by by your side
Deep inside your heart
Now and forever I am yours
Keep my baby deep inside your heart
You know I don't want to leave you
I want you to know
I'm always there babe by your side
Whenever we're apart
You know I love you evermore
I will be there by by your side
Deep inside your heart
Now and forever I am yours
Deep inside your heart

11. Far Away
Sleep my lady
Wake and do not shed a tear for me
You knew someday that I would have to leave you
Lonely highway
Morning sun will find me far away
You know that if I could I would stay with you
I'm on my way now... I'm on my way
Endless highway
Reaches out to touch the morning sky
The desert wind is rushing through my window
And far away I know she is rising
And far away I know waits for me
And far away she is crying
If there was a way babe
You know that I would be there
Sleep my lady
You know someday we will meet again
We'll dance beneath the moon, dream of forever
It seems so far away
That day, just seems so far away
Sleep my sweet lady
Wake and do not shed a tear for me
You know that I will always love you

1. March To Glory
[Instrumental]

[Music: Arranged by J. Drenning, J. Lords]
[Originally written and recorded by: Enya]

["It is not the critic who counts, nor the one who points out how the strong person stumbled, or where the doer of deeds could have done them better. The credit belongs to those who are actually in the arena; whose faces are marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strive valiantly; who err and come up short again and again; who know the great enthusiasm, the great devotion, and spend themselves in a worthy cause, who at the best know in the end the triumph of high achievement; and who are at the worst, if failing, at least fail while daring greatly; so that their place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who know neither victory nor defeat." - Theodore Roosevelt]

2. War Of The Worlds
[Music: J. Drenning, J. Lords]
[Lyrics: J. Drenning, J. Lords]

From out of the dark we descend upon your small blue world
Millions of miles a way
With blinding speed our destruction rains down on you
To blow you away...
Waiting in shadows of silence for our kiss of death to come
A world in flames
Burned and destroyed beyond all recognition
That only dust remains...

We are the Sons of the Gods who killed the Daughters of Men
And created their souls
Cold black eyes slice through you like razors of fire
War of the Worlds!!

[Chorus:]
War!!
War of the Worlds
War!!
War of the Worlds

[chorus]

["The last century of the millennium is a mountain, on which three beasts (wars) sleep. The first one will wake up in the beginning of the road (century). And from its throat will go out blood. The Second will wake up in the middle of the road. And from its throat it will come fire. The third will wake up at the end of the road. And from its throat will come the horrible heresy". - Prophecy of Staretz, Russia, 1850.]

3. New World Machine
[Music: J. Drenning, J. Lords]
[Lyrics: B. Martinez, J. Drenning]

I feel I'm becoming mechanized
World spinning before me made computerized
Separate from soul
Giving up control
Kills the man in me
In electric dreams...

From hear to eternity
From now to infinity
Destroyed...we watch you bleed
The New World Machine!!

[Chorus:]
All we are, all we need
Has become the New World Machine

Now it's time to take another step
Neuro-spike insertion cracks the chest
Input data speed
The memory exceeds
The emptiness in me
Fills an endless sea...

From hear to eternity
From now to infinity
Destroyed...we watch you bleed
The New World Machine!!

[lead]

[chorus]

[end]

["For stranger than the last times may seem, the last century of the millennium will overcome all the others. In that period of terror, there will be great spiritual poverty... From the sky the hell will fall... Poisoned clouds will cover the earth. Monstrous machines will dominate the skies. The fire will destroy many cities. The men will finish destroying each other ". - Found in Monastery of Sainte Claire, Perpignan, France, 14th century.]

4. Astronomica
[Music: J. Drenning, J. Lords]
[Lyrics: B. Martinez, J. Drenning]

Focused on eternity
Ancient gaze...into the morning sun
Tell me now...What do you see?
Hiding...Celestial mysteries
I See...
Astronomica...

Years of light away
Second sister to the eternal sun
I can't believe my eyes
That the prophecies have come
Stretched beyond the limits
Out into the unknown
No words that I can give it
Except "my mind is blown"

[Chorus:]
World's spinning round in space
Lonely star without a face
Left by ourselves we trace
Our footsteps back
To Astronomica...

A twinkle in the eye of a past life's memory
Something that I used to think...
Someone I used to be...
I see...

[chorus]

I can't believe my eyes

["There will be signs in the sun, moon and stars. The sun will be darkened, and the moon will not give its light; the stars will fall from the sky, and the heavenly bodies will be shaken. On the earth, nations will be in anguish and perplexity at the roaring and tossing of the sea. Men will faint with terror, apprehensive of what is coming on the world, for the heavenly bodies will be shaken."  - Luke 21: 25-26; Matthew 24:29]

5. Edge Of Forever
[Music: J. Drenning, J. Lords]
[Lyrics: B. Martinez, J. Drenning]

I lay back to rest my weary eyes
Dream of better days and of bluer skies
Safe inside my sleep I feel my soul scream
I would stay here forever if I could only dream...

And the world keeps turning faster
Still I reach for the unknown
For a handful of hope
On the Edge of Forever...

Dust collects on my face once alive with a glow
It dulls the perception of life as we used to know
All I keep thinking is how will they cope?
When my time has come
Like dust into earth, without a trace
Does my body go setting me free

And the world keeps turning faster
Still I reach for the unknown
For a handful of hope
On the Edge of Forever...

[Chorus:]
Oceans of sand and their destiny
Alive in the waves of an endless sea
Some of us fall, some of us fly, most of us live to try
To reach the Edge of Forever...

6. Touch The Sun
[Music: J. Drenning, J. Lords]
[Lyrics: B. Martinez, J. Drenning]

Looking down upon your world
Desperate changes it goes through
My black-eyed point of view...
Though you think you know my face
Occupying space (is what)
Brings me here to you...

Dark clouds fill your mind with memories we design
Mask the fear of evil you can't conceive
Transversed through time and space
"There is no God" to save your race
We harvest the worlds we need...

With dark eyes we steal your minds with memories deep inside
You hide in fear from terror you can't conceive
Bending time and space
"We are the Gods" of your race
We harvest the worlds that we need...

[Chorus:]
If we could only Touch The Sun
To dream is not enough
The world is on our hands...

[chorus]

["At the end of the Millennium, the signals and the number will appear in the sky. The iron birds will obscure the sun. The beasts of Apocalypse will come out from the sea. The flames from the hell will surround the Earth. At the same time, the sky will burn and the sea will grow and the lands will be swallowed. And the man will know the truth". - Prophecy of a Saint-Almis Templar]

7. Lucifer's Hammer
[Music: J. Drenning, J. Lords]
[Lyrics: J. Drenning, J. Lords]

I am what you need
I am everything
I will destroy your dreams
I will make you bleed

[repeat verse]

I am genocide
I destroy all life
Slam into your side
Hell and earth collide

[Chorus:]
Slam down my Hammer!!
Black out the sun - as hell and earth collide
Slam down my Hammer!!
Black out the sun - as hell and earth collide

I am oblivion
Angel full of sin
From heaven I descend Destroyer for the end

8. The Other Side Of Midnight
[Music: J. Drenning, J. Lords]
[Lyrics: B. Martinez, J. Drenning]

Midnight tolls on the clock downstairs
A reminding voice inside my head that does not care
His rapture keeps me waiting for a life behind the attic door
Footsteps on the stairs...no one there...

I watch my shadow fade to gray
From the warmth of daylights charm
I cower, turn and run away
From a light so bright and warm

With my fading health
I start to cry and cut myself
To watch the blood look silver
In the blessing of the moon...

I sit here in my rocking chair
They've come again to tie me down and wash my hair
Faceless figures on the wall
Haunt me 'til the morning dawn
Behind the Attic door
Why can't they let me go?

Here where devil's roam
Twisted and bleeding all alone
In this hell beyond the light
On the other side of Midnight...

The other side of Midnight!!

I bang my head against the wall
To kill the demons in my soul
I blind myself so I can't see
Evil things inside of me...

You're not me?
Who's there?
Am I evil?

9. Cyber-Christ
[Music: J. Drenning, J. Lords]
[Lyrics: J. Drenning, J. Lords]

I have the power to bend time and space
I stare into you but you don't see my face

Sacrifice the father
Scold the one who sins
Paralyze the daughter
And steal the seed within...

He who gives life everlasting
He keeps your soul in his hands

[Chorus:]
Cyber-Christ - Pray for me
Cyber-Christ - Die for me
Cyber-Christ - On your knees
Cyber Christ - Bleed for me

I am the savior, I'm the one you fear
My resurrection...The end of time is near

Sacrifice the father
Scold the one who sins
Paralyze the daughter
And steal the seed within

[chorus]

He who gives life everlasting
He keeps your soul in his hands

10. Cydonia
[Music: J. Drenning, J. Lords]
[Lyrics: B. Martinez, J. Drenning]

God whispered out to me from outer space
His voice echoed then disappeared without a trace...

Beyond the light of the sun...
Beyond the edge of forever...
I hear the angels sing...

[Chorus:]
Cydonia - city I see in dreams
City I see in dreams
Cydonia - shrouded in mystery
You stare out in space all alone

God's eyes stare down at me from outer space
He looked deep in side of me...a lonely place...

Beyond the light of the sun...
Beyond the edge of forever...
I hear the angels sing...

[Chorus:]
Cydonia - City I see in dreams
City I see in dreams
Cydonia - Shrouded in mystery
Cydonia - City I see in dreams
Starlight's majesty
Cydonia - Shrouded in mystery

You stare out in space all alone

4. Dragon Lady (Live Version)
The full moon is burning
In the crimson sky
A wicked witches laughter
Echoes in the night
The wolves of doom howl
A warning to the wind
Red eyes of fire
Haunting your dreams again

Watch out for her poison heart
She's a dragon lady
Look into her crystal ball
It tells all
Watch out now she's breathing fire
She's a dragon lady
Look into her crimson eyes
Say good-bye!

Watch out for her poison heart
She's a dragon lady
Look into her crystal ball
It tells all
Watch out now she's breathing fire
She's a dragon lady
Look into her crimson eyes
Say good-bye!

Dragon lady wants to meet you
Step into her lair
Death waits in the shadows
Enter the fire and challenge the witch
If you dare
Enter the fire and challenge the witch
If you dare
No, no, no, no

Watch out for her poison heart
She's a dragon lady
Look into her crystal ball
It tells all
Watch out now she's breathing fire
She's a dragon lady
Look into her crimson eyes
You shall die!

She's a dragon lady

Watch out
Dragon lady wants to meet you

5. Eternal World (Live Version)
Down through the valley of shadows we go
Into the canyon of moonlight below

Stairs of stone descending
Down where the magic river's bending

Down the river we go
To the sea of gold

(Where?) things are not as they seem
(Why?) you are not as you were

Behold eternal world
Where time has no meaning
Reality is dreaming

Feel your flesh is melting
Feel you spirit twisting
Feel it ripping at your mind
There's no time for praying
Feel your soul is pleading
Welcome to eternal world
