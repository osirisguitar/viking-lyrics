1. Save Me
Ready to sin for the pride of my king
ready to leave for his love
What a stranger world, where a kingdom may fall
for a "caprice" of a lord
In my hall there's a reek of sin that flows
lost in the darkness i can feel your presence
my shame won't be cleansed anymore

Save me, oh my God
'cause i've got to sell my soul
won't you save me once again?
Won't you hear my silent pray?

Slave to a portrait, the king fell in love
"bring me that girl", his final word
Should ever a poor man, as i really am
live by his faith, or obedience

[Magnani C., Cantarelli A.]

2. Out Of Memory
Come to the city where madness takes over
come to the land where the nightmare comes true

Open your mind to a fantasy-travel
where no more rules dominate out this world

I know and i remember the silences
I've seen and i don't relate of death

All i've seen and all i wanted
i wasted my time, now i flow with the sand

I've never begun, i haven't finished, yet ...
I am a step out of memory

[Magnani C.]

3. In The Shade
Livin' in a wasteland
without any shadows
what's left for me to see?
I wonder with my soul
Your Angel-eyes are shining bright
I wanna take your hand
All I know is I can't live with you

In the shade, I will remember
In the shade, I will remember

Fear lives inside your mind
(but) my dream is still alive
and I'm never looking back
I'm dreaming peace and love

Find you lost in any place
I'm miles away
I'll be searching high and low

In the shade, I will remember
In the shade, I will remember

In the shade, I will remember
In the shade, I will remember

[Music: Mangnani, Tordiglione, Cantini]
[Lyrics: Tordiglione]

4. Falling Rain
Deep in my heart i would like find
A place for love ...
It's not so easy as i'd like ...

And all this time, all this time we lost
just to follow a dream ...
Nothing will remain ...

The rain is falling down onto me
falling down as a silent cry

Now i'm staring at the mirror and
inside my heart
i can find my inner soul ...
now i'm staring at the mirror and
inside my eyes
nothing but a little tear ...

It's not our way and i think
you gotta find one
(a little angel starts to cry

This falling rain is telling now
a love is dying
but it will live into your heart

The rain is falling down to me
falling down as a silent cry
Now i'm staring at the mirror and
inside my heart
i can find my inner soul ...
now i'm staring at the mirror and
inside my eyes
nothing but a little tear ...

Deep in my heart i would like find
A place for love ...
and all this time
all the time we lost
just to follow a dream ...

Now i'm staring at the mirror and
inside my heart
I can find my inner soul ...
now i'm staring at the mirror and
inside my eyes
nothing but a little tear ...

Now i'm staring at the mirror and
inside my heart
I can find my inner soul ...
now i'm staring in the mirror and
all around
nothing but falling rain ...

[Magnani C., Cantarelli A., Tiranti R.]

LABYRINTH LYRICS


1. Midnight Resistance
Staying behind the stars
I look at the world and I listen to reason...
I hear an innocent voice, it whisper me a new law
whispers me the way
and I'm sleeping with my dreams

And other crimes and violation
political mistake
everything went according to plan
I made the mistake to trust in them

Ride the sky one more time
ride the sky tonight

Look another way
when moonlight takes the sky
I see the shadows of nighttime
spinning around me...
A mirage in the night
It's a magic for my heart
a drop stolen from the Sea of Eternity

And other crimes and violation
political mistake
everything went according to plan
I made the mistake to trust in them

Ride the sky one more time
ride the sky tonight

I feel a new sensation when I close my eyes
I'm dancing with the clouds
I feel a new temptation run away with my mind
chasing drops of moonlight...

I feel a new sensation when I close my eyes
I'm dancing with the clouds
I feel a new temptation run away with my mind
chasing drops of moonlight...

2. Rad Zone
I've walked in the street of yesterday
I've talked with your eyes as blue the sky

And we learned the hard way
we wanted to live forever
every way together

walking to red zone to the silence of night
I've looked at the city of yesterday

And we've paid with our lives
we'd wanted to live forever
every way together

I've broken everything I've made...
...we've wanted to live forever
every way together...

3. I'm On Fire
Electric madness take the night
frontal collision with your mind
a psycho incident you smell insane
her sweet corruption your adrenalin.

Breaking an entering...silence your enemy
I'm on fire...
...I will show now mercy...
I'm on fire...
Breaking an entering...silence your enemy

4. Out Of Memory
A wasteland tells the history
mental travels of memory
eternal dark for my eyes
eternal silence for my hearing.

Moonlight is all I need
Fading into my dreams
walking through the land of time
(with) memories by my side...

5. Virtual Vortex

6. Gates Of Madness
In my life, in my soul
In my memory I live my dream

(you) take my life, take my soul
take my memory, we lost an year.

This confusion is my agony
My life is lonely but I'm born to need no one

Oh my god you know I'm out of my head
...my heart is sad

Living in dreams trough your eyes
...I drop to the sky
...What's up in my mind?

Imagination makes dreams reality
I walk with my shadow
searching for the truth
I live and learn by my mistakes

LABYRINTH LYRICS


1. Mortal Sin
Eleven masters, eleven lights
eleven fires burning bright
A fall of tears flows the night
She takes my hands and closes her eyes

Refuse to be the God they want
refuse to leave the girl I love
The cheeky deed defied their pride
no mercy inside their eyes

They will remember the time
When i did the mortal sin
Can't I love a mortal woman?
And never the gods in the sky
will forgive my mortal sin
Wasted with a mortal woman

A goldian flash divides my hands
a sudden night and now she's lost
Lost in time in the land of dreams
Wasted wall (of) celestial maze

The Guardian Angel is calling now
gates of pain unclose for me
Lost in maze i'll look for her
She'll guide me along to find the way

They will remember the time
When i did the mortal sin
Can't I love a mortal woman?
And never the gods in the sky
will forgive my mortal sin
Wasted with a mortal woman

We shall remember the time
When we did the mortal sin
Can't I love a mortal woman?
And never the gods in the sky
will forgive my mortal sin
Wasted with a mortal woman

[Music: Tordiglione, Magnani, Rubulotta]
[Lyrics: Tordiglione, Magnani]

2. Midnight Resistance
Staying behind the stars
I look at the world and I listen to reason ...
I hear an innocent voice, it whispers me
a new law
it whispers me the way
and i'm sleeping with my dreams

Unholy love's my violation
a theological mistake
Everything went according to plan
you made the mistake to trust in me

Ride the sky one more time
ride the sky tonight

Look another way
Where moonlight takes the sky
I see the shadows of nighttime
spinning around me ...
A mirage in the night
It's a magic for my heart
a drop stolen from in the sea of Eternity

Unholy love's my violation
a theological mistake
Everything went according to plan
you made the mistake to trust in me

Ride the sky one more time
ride the sky tonight

I feel a new sensation when I close my eyes
I'm dancing with the clouds
I feel a new temptation run away with my mind
chasing drops of moonlight ...

Unholy love's my violation
a theological mistake
Everything went according to plan
you made the mistake to trust in me

[Music: Mangnani, Tordiglione, Rubulotta]
[Lyrics: Tordiglione]

3. Dreamland
Night is leaving too early
My dreams are falling away
I lie dreaming to run close
Why are you fading away from me?

Lost in you I'm going nowhere
Searching for the land of dreams (where do you live?)
Are you somewhere—somewhere in my mind?
In Dreamland?

A light flashes my mind
Brightening finally all the air
You standing tall watching me
Your eyes are pulling me over time

Lost in you I won't awake
Riding for the land of dreams
Going somewhere—somewhere in my mind
In Dreamland

Living nowhere, somewhere in my mind
Riding somewhere, going everywhere
Searching for the land of dreams (where do you live?)
... in timeless Dreamland ...

[Music: Tordiglione]
[Lyrics: Mangnani]

4. Piece Of time
Slowly (you) inflame my fantasy and open another
chapter, a moment of ludicity

Somewhere I'm waiting for a sign that shows me a direction
Let me across the Lab�rinth

I wanna a Piece of Time
I see myself in your eyes
I wanna a Piece of Time
Again to close your eyes
I wanna a Piece of Time
To dance with your lonely heart
I wanna a Piece fo Time
I please you don't forget

It's too late to make a change
This wasteland can feel my agony
I've heard the distance in your voice
I live and learn by my mistakes

Slowly (you) inflame my fantasy and open another
chapter, a moment of ludicity

I wanna a Piece of Time
I see myself in your eyes
I wanna a Piece of Time
Again to close your eyes
I wanna a Piece of Time
To dance with your lonely heart
I wanna a Piece fo Time
I please you don't forget

I wanna a Piece of Time
I see myself in your eyes
I wanna a Piece of Time
Again to close your eyes
I wanna a Piece of Time
To dance with your lonely heart
I wanna a Piece fo Time
Again to close your eyes

[Music: Magnani, Rubulotta, Tordiglione]

5. Vertigo
[Instrumental]

6. In The Shade
Livin' in a wasteland
without any shadows
what's left for me to see?
I wonder with my soul

Your Angel-eyes are shining bright
I wanna take your hand
All I know is I can't live with you

In the shade, I will remember
In the shade, I will remember

Fear lives inside your mind
(but) my dream is still alive
and I'm never looking back
I'm dreaming peace and love

Find you lost in any place
I'm miles away
I'll be searching high and low

In the shade, I will remember
In the shade, I will remember

In the shade, I will remember
In the shade, I will remember

[Music: Mangnani, Tordiglione, Cantini]
[Lyrics: Tordiglione]

7. No Limits
Can you remember the time
now I'm standing in this way
All my life for this time
Why? Can you feel me in this time?
Why? Can you see me in this time?
All that we love shall burn

No limits no pretenders
no limits no tomorrow

Can you remember the time
Why? Can you feel me in this time?
Why? Can you see me in this time?
All that we love shall burn

No limits no pretenders
no limits no tomorrow

Sitting all alone in the corner
a man is on the razor's edge
now the woman's crying ...
(the) woman's into a secret place
many, many miles away
she dreams of love

No limits no pretenders
no limits no tomorrow

[Music: Mangnani, Tordiglione]
[Lyrics: Tordiglione]

8. The Right Sign
I believe in the power of love
I want to see a change in the future

take me to places I've never seen
all of you have to pay
(Gods you know?)

Ice and fire ... Where's the land of my desire?
Ice and fire ... Cast a dream and feel the power

I believe in the power of love
I want to see a change in the future

take me to places I've never seen
all of you have to pay
(Gods you know?)

Ice and fire ... Where's the land of my desire?
Ice and fire ... Cast a dream and feel the power

Ice and fire ... Where's the land of my desire?
Ice and fire ... Cast a dream and feel the power

[Music: Rubulotta, Tordiglione]
[Lyrics: Tordiglione]

9. Red Zone
I've walked in the street of yesterday
I've walked with your eyes as blue as the sky

And we learned the hard way
we wanted to live forever
everyone together

walking to red zone through the silence of night
I've looked at the city of yesterday

And we've paid with our lives
we wanted to live forever
everyway together

I've broken everything we've made ...
... we wanted to live forever
everyway together

[Music: Mangnani, Tordiglione, Rubulotta]
[Lyrics: Tordiglione]

10. Time Has Come
Too far away her eyes surround me
her smile fills my heart
and I'm awaiting for my destiny
and I've been waiting for the stranger
to show me what he knows
he's looking sad, he knows my destiny

Fantasy in my mind
She's standing near my shadow
I open my eyes (show me the way)
Too far away her eyes surround me
her smile fills my heart
and I'm looking for our destiny
and I've been waiting for the stranger
to show me what he knows
he's looking sad, he knows my destiny

Time has come (for me to live another day)
Time has come (we'll dance again ...)

Close your eyes now (you) realize a day
when we'll meet again
all this time I've wanted to say
time has come
so many tears ... don't close your eyes
I can't live without you so many days ...
and when you smile I can fly ...

Time has come (for me to live another day)
Time has come (we'll dance again ...)

Time has come (for me to live another day)
Time has come (we'll dance again ...)

[Music: Rubulotta, Tordiglione]
[Lyrics: Tordiglione]

11. Looking For...
In this Wasteland without shadows
I'm searching your eyes
I feel the rain on my eyes

Still are you dreaming?
Tears in your eyes ...
I need to live my life

[Music: Mangnani]
[Lyrics: Tordiglione]

12. Call Me
[Music: Mangnani, Rubulotta, Tordiglione, Cantini]
[Lyrics: Mangnani]

Light me now
There is a Light coming from S.O.U.L.-W.A.I.S.T.E.
This time, your voice is calling me
Moonlight so sweetly winds the maze
hard time, now I realize the ways to go

Where do you live? I feel cold in my heart
we can't see the colour of the Ocean

all your love

A light kills my enemy it shows her
Goodbye, my only hope is freedom
but you, I please you, don't be afraid
be sure one day I'll find the way

Where do you live? I feel cold in my heart
we can't see the colour of the Ocean
What do you need? I see tears in your eyes
we can't see the colour of the Ocean

Over, all alone you queen of Dreamland
I'm flying away
all the Visions behind me,
and the time has gone away

Where do you live? I feel cold in my heart
we can't see the colour of the Ocean
What do you need? I see tears in your eyes
we can't see the colour of the Ocean

13. Miles Away
[Music: Mangnani, Tordiglione, Rubulotta]
[Lyrics: Tordiglione]

Time has changed our lives
I'm searching for the answers
picking up the pieces of my live
somewhere along the way.

Can't you look me screaming?
I look for your face in this light
and you're reaching for something you never had
I'm miles
and we live the hard way
day by day
tears are far away
all the night is blinding me side by side

I'm miles away

Try to see my story from a different side
now I can remember
why I need to run.

Can't you look me screaming?
I look for your face in this light
and you're reaching for something you never had
I'm miles
and we live the hard way
live my day
tears are far away
and the night is blinding me side by side

I'm miles away
I'm miles away
I'm miles away

Time has changed our lives
I'm searching for the answers
picking up the pieces of my live
somewhere along the way.

1. Moonlight
Faced to the ivory gates of dreamsland
I look my steps being lost in the sand
Is this the place where they created your soul
Where all your tears have been shed for so long?

Moon don't tell me lies
don't let me roam forever
Moonlight take the sky
Show me the way to heaven ...

Moonlight shining in the sky
nothing more can stop my flight
Take my hand again, fly with me
thousand million miles away

Leaving the town of the ancient dreams
new reasons come to live for ...

Now that we are leaving out of maze
I can imagine all the masters' rage
Meaning is that love is stronger than hate
Meaning is that will is stronger than fate

Moon don't tell me lies
don't let me roam forever
Moonlight take the sky
Show me the way to heaven ...

Moonlight shining in the sky
nothing more can stop my flight
Take my hand again, fly with me
thousand million miles away

[SOLO: RAIN/THÖRSEN]

Moonlight shining in the sky
nothing more can stop my flight
Take my hand again, fly with me
thousand million miles away

[Magnani C., Cantarelli A., Rubulotta F.]

2. New Horizons
Another day is dying
Moonlight' shining high
Peace is winding all around
I look up to the sky
a sudden blazing light
shaking my soul to the ground

Across the seas, around the hills and over
I can feel all your love ...
Reflections of a wasted love in my eyes
unchaining from my heart

Tell me now Fathers of the Sky
why a love should die
you have damned my life
try to tell me why ...

Another day is dying
Moonlight' shining high
Peace is winding all around
Despite of Master's will
Against this destiny
I will find the way to try ...

Across the seas, around the hills and over
I can feel all your love ...
Reflections of a wasted love in my eyes
unchaining from my heart

Tell me now Fathers of the Sky
why a love should die
you have damned my life
try to tell me why ...

[SOLO: RAIN/THÖRSEN/TOGETHER]

Tell me now Fathers of the Sky
why a love should die
you have damned my life
try to tell me why ...
To new horizons fly ...

[Magnani C., Cantarelli A., Rubulotta F.]

3. The Night Of Dreams
Close your eyes, can you see?
It's the land of Secret Dreams Take my hands.
Follow me where Time escapes from Reality
Can you feel the loneliness burning in my heart?
I would need an Angel to teach me again to fly

Fly to me and save me
Heal my broken wings
Close your eyes and kiss me
'cause tonight

It's The night of Dreams
and your crystal - eyes could drive me to the light
It's The night of Dreams
and I can finally dream to fly

higher, till the sky

Every day and every night I look up for your eyes
rain is falling from the sky like tears and I don't like

Fly to me and save me
Heal my broken wings
Close your eyes and kiss me
'cause tonight

It's The night of Dreams
and your crystal - eyes could drive me to the light
It's The night of Dreams
and I can finally dream to fly

higher, till the sky

Now I wonder what I would ever have been
If I had never met you
Stars in the sky are shining as never before
Now I can answer, I know ("What is Love?")

[SOLO: THÖRSEN/RAIN]

Fly to me

It's the night

[Magnani C., Rubulotta F., F. Contini L.]

4. Lady Lost In Time
Lady, lost in time
Lady, let me try
Never lose the faith
Keep on trying once again

Wake up from the night
Flowing in your mind
time has gone, but something's left behind
... a little twinkling light ...

light of wasted memories
tell me, can you see?
Everyone has one, somewhere in his heart
... you simply gotta find.

Lady, lost in time
Lady, let me try
Never lose the faith
Keep on trying once again

Tell me what you feel
Tell me what you need
If you're calling for some help on your way
... I promise. I'll be there ...

Please don't ask me why,
Please don't make me lie
Life is like a game in wich you win or lose
but you can't ever choose

Lady, lost in time
Lady, let me try
Never lose the faith
Keep on trying once again

[SOLO: TOGETHER/RAIN/THÖRSEN]

Lady, lost in time
Lady, let me try
Never lose the faith
Keep on trying once again

[Magnani C., Cantarelli A., Rubulotta F.]

5. State Of Grace
When it's late and stars go to sleep
I lie and wait for a new Dream

My State of Grace ...

When light fades
everything 'round
melts with shades
in a Time-Escape

It's my world made for my Dreams
far away from my Fears and my Sins
and so alone I rest in peace
and I finally feel a State of Grace
It's my world so far away
from the Pain that I need everyday

So many days without a smile
I need to stay and rest for a while

In my world made of my Dreams
far away from my Fears and my Sins
and so alone I rest in peace
and I finally feel a State of Grace
It's my world so far away
from the Pain that I feel everyday

[SOLO: THÖRSEN/RAIN/TOGETHER]

It's my world made for my Dreams
far away from my Fears and my Sins
and so alone I rest in peace
and I finally feel a State of Grace
It's my world so far away
from the Pain that I need everyday

[Magnani C., Rubulotta F., Contini L.]

6. Heaven Denied
Over the starlights
There's a world nobody's seen before
... There's my world ...
I still remember

When they banished me for my sin
... and you with me ... 

"Remember my words - I said - One day I'll come back"

I'm turning back to the Heaven denied
Once i had gone, today I'll turn to light (am I dreaming?)

[SOLO: THÖRSEN]

Feelings of peace
fighting with this Harred in my heart
... I need more time ...
Stay close to me 
Close your eyes and use your heart to see
... Pure as steel ... 

And flying with me you will see
that Heaven I lost for you

I'm turning back to the Heaven denied
Once I had gone, today I'll turn to light

[SOLO: THÖRSEN/RAIN/THÖRSEN]

I'm turning back to the Heaven denied
Once i had gone, today I'll turn to light

Dayafterdayafterdayafterday ...

[Magnani C., Cantarelli F., Rubulotta F.]

7. Thunder
Look at the fire and follow the light
dancing around in the night
look at it's flames burning up, reaching out for the Sky

That is the way I could say how I feel
feeling the flame burning me
flowin' inside out my blood cold as steel

like a Thunder my Rage
Could explode in your face
Like a Thunder my Rage
Like a Thunder ...

I feel Fire is burning inside
my reason's losing the fight
my lust for Vengeance is calling and claiming my Pride

Look at the fire and follow the light
dancing around in the night
look at it's flames burning up, reaching out for the Sky

like a Thunder my Rage
Could explode in your face
Like a Thunder my Rage
Like a Thunder ...

[SOLO: THÖRSEN/RAIN]

like a Thunder my Rage
Could explode in your face
Like a Thunder my Rage
Like a Thunder ...

[Magnani C., Cantarelli F.]

8. Feel
[legend B. remix]

[Music: Jens Ahrens]
[by Cenith X]
[instrumental]

9. Time After Time
Father, please, take care of my soul
maybe I won't be so strong
Time has come for me to close my wings
and pay for my Mortal sin

You ... don't try to stop the Pain that rides
into my veins - inside
it's like a river flowing straight
fulfilled of Hate

Time after time
but what has left behind?
nothing else than lies ...
All this long time got me to find
they sealed my Heaven Denied

Stop this Hatred burning in my head
now i'd need to forget

You ... don't try to stop the Pain that rides
into my veins - inside
it's like a river flowing straight
fulfilled of Hate

Time after time
but what has left behind?
nothing else than lies ...
All this long time got me to find
they sealed my Heaven Denied

Time after time tonight
we can finally see the light
it's light of love calling me
am I dreaming, is it real?
... No more lies ...

[SOLO: RAIN/THÖRSEN]

Time after time ...

[Magnani C., Cantarelli F.]

10. Falling Rain
[SOLO: RAIN]

Deep in my heart
I would like to find a place for love
... It's not so easy as i'd like ...
and all this time, all the time we've lost
Just to follow a dream
... nothing will remain ...

The rain is falling down on me
falling down as a silent cry

Now I'm staring at the mirror and inside my heart
I can't find my inner soul
Now I'm staring at the mirror and inside my eyes
nothing but a little tear ...

It's not your way and I think you gotta find one
... a little Angel starts to cry ...
This falling rain is telling now a love is dying
... but i will live into your heart ...

The rain is falling ...

Now I'm staring ...

Deep in my heart
I would like to find a place for love
and all this time, all the time we've lost
Just to follow a dreams ...

[SOLO: RAIN/THÖRSEN]

Now I'm staring at the mirror and inside my heart
I can't find my inner soul
Now I'm staring at mirror and all around
nothing but falling rain ...

[Magnani C., Cantarelli F., Tiranti R.]

11. Die For Freedom
I hear their voices calling
I feel their eyes watching me

Nothing but few words to say
Mercy's not the one I'll pray
I won't be their slave ... no more ...

Tonight we'll pay out lust for freedom
d'you see my eyes?
They're bold and proud 'cause I don't fear the price

Die for freedom - that's the price we will pay
Die for freedom - am I dying in vain?
We faced the Masters (higher of Sins)
Die for freedom

My dreams are falling down
now I understand what it means ...

Masters call, I have to go
should I follow what they said?
Tell me now: is there a reason why?

Tonight we'll pay out lust for freedom
d'you see my eyes?
They're bold and proud 'cause I don't fear the price

Die for freedom - that's the price we will pay
Die for freedom - am I dying in vain?
We faced the Masters (higher of Sins)
Die for freedom

[SOLO: BREEZE/RAIN/THÖRSEN]

Tonight we'll pay our lust for freedom ...
Die for freedom

LABYRINTH LYRICS


1. Chapter 1
1679, hall of Versailles,
Louis the XIV is having a party.
At this court of betrayers and liars
wheel of fate's gonna turn anyway...

"Welcome to my home, again.
Enjoy your time..."

And through the darkness
candles, lighten the hall
like thousands (of) dancers
reflecting on the walls...
"Let's start the dances,
no one shall stand tall..."

Midnight time, in the hall of Versailles
greatest pleasure: a present for Louis
it's a gift from the ruler of Venice
"... Just a portrait, my daughter in it"

In a beating of the heart
the king fell in love

And through the candles
Louis starts dreamin' on...
Dramatic fancy:
the king has fallen in love!

Oh, Kathryn, through the candles
I can see your face...
Oh, can't you see?
My heart is bleeding, screaming for you...

For love or lust,
feelings or passion, who knows?
And through the candles
Louis starts dreamin' on...
The king is calling,
who will dare to deny?

2. Kathryn
What happened? I can't stand it...
I don't like this feeling...
I'm Louis, the ruler,
I always get what I want!

And I need her love.
Now, before it's too late...
Yes, I need that girl,
oh, Kathrin, now I just need you
much more than the air...

Kathryn...
You'll be mine tomorrow.
Kathryn,
passion made me blind!
Kathryn,
I will stop my sorrow
Kathryn,
when you will be mine...

My heart beats for those eyes:
They've raped my soul...
Don't tell me what is right,
kings have no fault.

I need her lips,
Till then I'll have no peace.
Lost in your image
oh, Kathryn days that will follow
will not be the same...

Kathryn...
You'll be mine tomorrow.
Kathryn,
passion made me blind!
Kathryn,
I will stop my sorrow
Kathryn,
when you will be mine...

3. Sons Of Thunder
Sounds like someone called my name...
Then, you see, I'm here...
Strange it is to find myself
in this noble place.

Sure I kneel to the king of kings
and I'll swear my loyalty

Everything you may need
(and every word you say)
just put your faith on me...

Remember our name,
it comes from inside,
stronger than all we are
sons of thunder!

Hidden in the shade we creep,
deadly as a silent blade

We are wherever
(everywhere you go)
disguised in the night...

Remember our name,
it comes from inside,
stronger than all we are
sons of thunder!

4. Elegy
So finally here we are,
I'm walking on her path.
Soon my shade will melt with the night,
setting up my trap.

And like on a spider's web
you'll get trapped by me!

Oh, no. Please don't be afraid,
I'll surely take care of you...

We are victims or hunters,
this is our life (just our life... )
and with a face like yours,
you are the nicest prize...

Once I asked to myself
how far I went for his lust,
but your finest features
really pay me off.

You've been my challenge,
but now I will set your free.

We are victims or hunters,
this is our life (just our life... )
and with a face like yours,
you are the nicest prize...

5. Behind The Mask
No, please don't cry
don't waste all your tears on this.
'cause that is life,
a destiny tough to change.

The only way to escape
from reality lives in our dreams...

No, little girl
I'm sorry but that's not a dream
don't start beggin' me:
I'm not the reason of your tears

What do you think of me?
I'm not as cruel as you may think...

Now look at me,
tell me now: what do you see?
Oh, behind the mask
there's a man who used to cry.

Now come with me
it's too late, no turning back!
Few days and a king
is going to pretend your hand...

And I'll take care of you:
they paid for this. Don't blame me.

Now look at me,
tell me now: what do you see?
Oh, behind the mask
there's a man who used to cry.

6. Touch The Rainbow
As birds are free to fly away,
so spread your wings and take your flight.
And please, forgive me, if you can
I was much too deaf to hear you cry.

Go, then, take your freedom!
Damn, I know I'm doing what is right.

So run as fast as you can,
don't ever turn back, never!
Until we'll touch the rainbow,
and a new sun will shine upon this land...

I'm not an angel, yes, I know:
I'm just a man who used to fight alone.
But now I promise: don't be afraid,
no more tears tonight.

We will save our freedom,
God I know we're doing what is right...

So run as fast as you can,
don't ever turn back, never!
Until we'll touch the rainbow,
and a new sun will shine upon this land...

My soul won't find peace in this heart
till I see solace in your sullen face...
Chills running down my spine,
as your image flows through my mind...

Still I'd die for freedom,
the only thing I'm feeling right...

So run as fast as you can,
don't ever turn back, never!
Until we'll touch the rainbow,
and a new sun will shine upon this land...

7. Rage Of The King
So, is this the end?
Well, I won't forget...
Time will give me a chance
to get my revenge.

Oh no, in the heart of kings
there's no place for love.
Oh, Kathryn, won't you take my heart?
Then I'll love no one...

Wherever you may go
you'll never be alone
even beyond the seas
you'll taste the rage of the king!

No, there is no escape
from the hate I feel...
Blood! That's what I need,
blood... So sweet to me...

Oh no, in the heart of kings
there's no place for love.
Kathryn, won't you come to me?
... Why you left me alone... ?

Wherever you may go
you'll never be alone
even beyond the seas
you'll taste the rage of the king!

Wherever you may go
you'll never be alone
even beyond the seas
you'll taste the rage

8. Save Me
Ready to leave for the pride of my King,
ready to sin for his love,
what a strange world, where a kingdom may fall
for a "caprice" of a lord...

In my hall, there's a reek of sin that flows...
lost in the darkness I can feel Your presence,
my shame won't be cleansed anymore...

Save me, oh my God!
'cause I've got to sell my soul,
won't You save me once again?
Won't You hear my silent pray?

Slave to a portrait, the king fell in love:
"bring me that girl", his final words...
Should ever a poor man, as I really am
live by his faith, or obedience...?

In my hall, there's a reek of sin that flows...
lost in the darkness I can feel Your presence,
my shame won't be cleansed anymore...

Save me, oh my God!
'cause I've got to sell my soul,
won't You save me once again?
Won't You hear my silent pray?

9. Love
I'm not the same
a warrior soul that burns away for love
I'm in a haze but there's a light, riding from her face

Maybe it could be love,
'cause you're the one who can move my heart,
no more rain on us a new day will shine...

Something inside:
a strange feel I never had in all my life...
I understand:
Kathryn, you know your stare, just take my breath away

Now I know it's love,
'cause you're the one who can move my heart,
no more rain on us a new day will shine...

Now I know it's love,
'cause you're the one who can move my heart,
no more rain on us a new day will shine...
... I've left my old life behind...

10. I Feel You
My old words and new dreams
Without taste or ideas
And your eyes make me scream
And my fear disappears

Oh, there is
No true love, oh

I feel you
Soft music is moving so lightly
A world that's exploading inside me

I feel you
Emotion is coming so brightly
Your heartbeat is pounding around me

Mi ami o no?
Mi ami o no?
Mi ami...

A sweet memory of you
And a song on the way
And the shadows of truth
Are flying away

Oh, there is
No true love, oh

I feel you
A beautiful lonely old statue
Don't leave me, you need me, come closer

I feel you
Lost island somewhere in the ocean
Two lovers are playing their first game

Mi ami o no?
Mi ami o no?
Mi ami o no?

I feel you
Strange visions are changing the desert
A wind full of dust wants to blind me

I feel you
A taste of the wild love inside me
I'm dying to meet you

Mi ami o no?
Mi ami o no?
Mi ami o no?

I feel you
I'm dying to meet you

11. Miles Away (Re-recorded)
[Japanese version bonus track]

Time has changed our lives
I'm searching for the answers
picking up the pieces of my live
somewhere along the way.

Can't you look me screaming?
I look for your face in this light
and you're reaching for something you never had
... I'm miles...
and we live the hard way
day by day
tears are far away
all the night is blinding me side by side

... I'm miles away...

Try to see my story from a different side
now I can remember
why I need to run.

Can't you look me screaming?
I look for your face in this light
and you're reaching for something you never had
... I'm miles...
and we live the hard way
live my day
tears are far away
and the night is blinding me side by side

... I'm miles away...

... I'm miles away...

... I'm miles away...

Time has changed our lives
I'm searching for the answers
picking up the pieces of my live
somewhere along the way.

1. Crossroads
Now I'm on my way
Livin' in a state of mind
Out of time

Sun is shining high
I've been driving my car fast
Since last night

Another crossroad and another choice
Road sign tells 6 miles to nowhere

No more fear to reach 'nowhere'
Am I insane?
No more reason to remain
Tied up in this reality

Maybe I am out of space
But it's better to stay away, than live today

I saw that fire that burns fed by innocent lives
I've had enough

The road is straight, I cannot see the end
But 6 miles now are almost done

No more fear to reach 'nowhere'
Am I insane?
No more reason to remain
Tied up in chains

No more fear to reach 'nowhere'
Am I insane?
No more reason to remain
Tied up in this reality

2. There Is A Way
Down in the street, I feel the heat
Even if (the) night wind blows on me
There's a fever blowing out
...as a slow disease

Depending on someone's will
It's not easy to decide
If you try to ask me how I feel
...Still alive and alone

Cry out and tell them, there is a way
Made of little signs of love and mercy
Cry out and someone will hear your voice
Maybe is not much but it's a good start

Before it's time to say goodbye
At the shadow of my cross
I just hope a change is gonna come
...a change for everyone

Too many flags without a sense
Everywhere you see the end
I believe there is a way
Cause it's not too late

Cry out and tell them, there is a way
Made of little signs of love and mercy
Cry out and someone will hear your voice
Maybe is not much but it's a good start

There is a way
I feel it today
No! Nothing is lost!

Cry out and tell them, there is a way
Made of little signs of love and mercy
Cry out and someone will hear your voice
Maybe is not much but it's a good start

Oh, there is a way

3. Lost
Heavy is the load..
Pushing down, on body and soul
Ready to explode
Time is ticking too slow..

The time is ticking too slow

Repressed rage, into a cage
I left my heart in a faded past
I cannot move, I barely stand
Mistakes and regrets as only friends

There's a world out there
And I still hang my head
I would give all my life
For a while out of these walls

A while out of these walls

Repressed rage, into a cage
I left my heart in a faded past
I cannot move, I barely stand
Mistakes and regrets as only friends

They're here for me, soon I'll be free
The hell would be easier than all this
I never prayed, don't need ya priest
My time is due, how sweet is the end..

Repressed rage, into a cage
I left my heart in a faded past
I cannot move, I barely stand
Mistakes and regrets as only friends

I never prayed, don't need ya priest
My time is due, how sweet is the end

4. Mother Earth
Across the bright light of a red sunset I saw
allthe beauty I never noticed before
Air is sweet and stroking my face as a kiss
I could never figure out a future without all this

See what we've done to mother earth No mercy, no pity we have
green and blue are turning in to black

Water is covered
by a veil of evil oil
they named it black gold

Ice is melting but ground is becoming sand
no more seasons no more spring summer or fall
exploitation will bring our lands right to the bone
what kind of future are we preparing for our sons?

See what we've done to mother earth
no mercy no pity we have
green and blue are turning in to black

Find just a reason to say "no"
or everything will soon be dead and gone lakes and seas are turning into mud

5. Waiting Tomorrow
Thinking of all the lies we told
...it wasn't so bad and now I know what it means
We are growing old,this is sad it's so hard to say
Those wheels are turning so much faster

Pay today all your dues without waiting for tomorrow
We need a white flag with ourselves
Do the best without rest for a better tomorrow
Don't left unspoken words again

Falling into a dark despair I can't find your smile
Why am I so blind?
The reasons of yesterday are gone

Light is so bright but I still can't see
Can someone guide me through this silent fog

Pay today all your dues without waiting (for) tomorrow
We need a white flag with ourselves
Do the best without rest for a better tomorrow
Don't left unspoken words again

6. Come Together
Here come old flat top he come, grooving up slowly he got
Joo joo eyeball he one, holy roller he got
Hair down to his knee, got to be a joker he just do what he please

He wear no shoeshine he got, toe jam football he got
Monkey finger he shoot, coca cola he say
I know you, you know me
One thing I can tell you is you got to be free

Come together right now over me

He bag production he got, walrus gumboot he got
Ono sideboard he one, spinal cracker he got
Feet down below his knee
Hold you in his armchair you can feel his disease

Come together right now over me

He roller coaster he got, early warning he got
Muddy water he one, mojo filter he say
One and one and one is three
Got to be good-looking cos he's so hard to see

Come together right now
Come together right now
Come together right now over me

7. Just One Day
Leave me alone
I don't wanna play
Another part in your mess

Now I need air
And I don't care
What the world is thinking

Won't be "anyone"
Without a face
A pawn in a crazy game

It's better to live
Free just one day
Than a whole life as a slave

I'll stay away
From what medias say
I'm scared of all that screaming

Don't need your thoughts
I still follow mine
And if I fall it will be my fault

8. What!!!
Everyone's looking for a direction to
Follow to reach the skies on our heads

But it's not for free,what do you think to give?
There's a price you have to pay in this life.

Tears are falling from a heaven gone
...lost,cast away on island of nowhere
Tears are falling flooding around me

Men are still the same,everyone has his truth
It's not mine it's not yours...it's...what???

Slaves to the bias,ready to judge the strange
Who's watching as evil in his eyes

Tears are falling from a heaven gone
...lost,cast away on island of nowhere
Tears are falling flooding around me

9. Coldness
The city is running too fast to realize
And old man is dying under rags 'n' dust
The streets like rivers but full of people
I never felt so alone in all my life

...I never felt so alone...

No one cares no one knows the coldness as the only law
I feel it through my veins
Hard to talk and meet the eyes, misty wheatyer on our days
Where do we go wrong??

They call it progress I call it sadness
If everyone is closed in his brainstorm
We lose the essence of a good living
Am I pathetic or just a realist?

...I call it sadness...

No one cares no one knows the coldness as the only law
I feel it through my veins
Hard to talk and meet the eyes, misty wheatyer on our days
Where do we go wrong??

10. Rusty Nail
A rusty nail
Down straight into the head
Infected brains
Communication failed

Turn off the light
Put out the fire
Free your mind free your deepest side

Red is the blood
Under each kind of skin
Green is the hope
But shame has no color

Turn off the light
Put out the fire
Free your mind free your deepest side

Never look back
Life is ahead
But don't forget your way home

11. Out Of Control
I'm sick
I'm mad
I'm feeling wrapped again
I breathe, but I'm still sinking

I'm done
I'm gone
I feel it in one bone
The walls around are falling

Voices are crying loud from inside (Crying loud from inside)

Out of control, I free fall
Through shadows and lightning
Inside a liquid terror
Don't believe your eyes

I'm dogged
I'm traced
Just wanna hide my face
I know my demons find me

You say
I'm fine
But I'm lying on the floor
The room is getting smaller

Voices are crying loud from inside (Crying loud from inside)

Out of control, I free fall
Through shadows and lightning
Inside a liquid terror
Don't believe your eyes

Can't you see what I feel
You don't know what it means
Livin' day by day waiting to die

To die

Out of control, I free fall
Through shadows and lightning
Inside a liquid terror
Don't believe your eyes

12. Wolves'N'Lambs
From the morning to the night
Breaking news of fights
All the certainties are gone
Do you get my drift?

It's another middle age
Same old fear and rage
Sneaking slowly through our feet
They are gaining ground

Comprehension for someone
Who's trying to surround us

Too many wolves in lambs' clothing ready to conquer and rule

Words of love or swords of god
Mixed and abused
Holy wars for cursed ideals
Look out they are here

Rising deadly like a gas
Stealing our breath
Planning slaughters at the shadow of distorted worths

Comprehension for someone
Who's trying to surround us

Too many wolves in lambs' clothing ready to conquer and rule

13. Smoke And Dreams
The twilight
Brings me hope and heat
Even if you're not here

Remember
What we've shared 'til now, it's a precious gift

Now you're far from me
Behind a curtain of smoke and dreams

I never wasted all in words
But I guess you know

Everytime you say 'love ya'
I forget my pain, no more falling rain

I can see your eyes
Behind a curtain of smoke and dreams

No matter where you are
Always in my heart

As a shadow I'll be close to you
Through good and bad days looking after your steps
An embrace coming from my soul
Everywhere you'll feel a little of me

As a shadow I'll be close to you
Through good and bad days looking after your steps
An embrace coming from my soul
Everywhere you'll feel a little of me

A little of me

As a shadow I'll be close to you
Through good and bad days looking after your steps
An embrace coming from my soul
Everywhere you'll feel a little of me

14. Piece Of Time
[Music: Magnani, Rubulotta, Tordiglione]
[Lyrics: Tordiglione]

Labyrinth
Slowly (you) inflame my fantasy and open another
chapter, a moment of lucidity

Somewhere I'm waiting for a sign that shows me a direction
Let me across the Labyrinth

I wanna a Piece of Time
I see myself in your eyes
I wanna a Piece of Time
Again to close your eyes
I wanna a Piece of Time
To dance with your lonely heart
I wanna a Piece of Time
I please you don't forget

It's too late to make a change
This wasteland can feel my agony
I've heard the distance in your voice
I live and learn by my mistakes

Slowly (you) inflame my fantasy and open another
chapter, a moment of lucidity

I wanna a Piece of Time
I see myself in your eyes
I wanna a Piece of Time
Again to close your eyes
I wanna a Piece of Time
To dance with your lonely heart
I wanna a Piece of Time
I please you don't forget

I wanna a Piece of Time
I see myself in your eyes
I wanna a Piece of Time
Again to close your eyes
I wanna a Piece of Time
To dance with your lonely heart
I wanna a Piece of Time
Again to close your eyes

1. L.Y.A.F.H.
Call my name through the noises of
This deafning silence
I will hear your voice as an angel's cry

The glow is painting a deep blue tapestry
Then I go....

Light years away from here
In a corner of my mind
Where I can easily hide
My real me from strangers' eyes

If you want the space is right for you and I, so
Follow me...

Light years away from here
In a corner of my mind
Where I can easily hide
My real me from strangers' eyes

Light years away from here
In a corner of my mind
I'll show you if you want
A new place for you and I

2. Deserter
Another battlefield, the history repeats itself
Just a dead machine, a number without a name or face
Welcome to hell again!

Fly away don't want to stay
I won't play your bloody game

She's alone and prays to rescue my soul but now I desert
I will take my box full of hopes and letters from home
Don't move remain in hell!

Fly away don't want to stay
I won't play your bloody game

Another battlefield, the history repeats itself
Just a dead machine, a number without a name or face
Welcome to hell again!

Fly away don't want to stay
I won't play your bloody game
Put yourself here in my place
Life is mine I take my blames

3. Dive In Open Waters
Free - I wanna be just me.... You cannot
Out - From any race or truth.... You cannot

Thinking with someone else's brain is no use but
They want us deaf and blind.... So deaf and blind

Dive in open waters
No more chains surround your arms now
Be yourself with no compromise

Dreaming - With open eyes is nice.... You cannot
Say - no to every lie they say.... You cannot

Living with someone else's face is no use but
They need us deaf and blind.... So deaf and blind

Dive in open waters
No more chains surround your arms now
Be yourself with no compromise

4. Freeman
Hard to believe when there's nothing to see
Blind faith is not for me
We had a Christ we made him bleed
....And someone took his fee

Where is my God maybe he has forgotten
Or is it just careless now

There is a place for every free man
Who wants to stay out of the flock?

Never before never so strong
The need to walk alone
Dark is the mind 'cause I don't know
What tomorrow will be

There is a place for every free man
Who wants to stay out of the flock?
Don't know if it's right or wrong
But I still sing my song
Until I have the strength to carry on

How to believe when there's too much to see
Fake faith is not for me
We are alone when we die and when we are born
Life runs fast as a storm

There is a place for every free man
Who wants to stay out of the flock?
Don't know if it's right or wrong
But still I sing my song
Until I have the strength to carry on

5. M3
Time is almost right
I can feel the adrenaline
I'm sure no one, no one can disturb my time

I'm so close to her
Just a step and I'll be there
I have the key to open a paradise on earth

No rules here
No fear dear
Engine is ready my heart starts shaking
Tonight I'll commit my crime oh yeah!!!

I don't know where my goal is
I run away from all the lies you told me

Now she is taking me to nowhere
This time I left behind me who I am

Hangin' on your wheel
Everything seems so unreal
Tires are screeching louder too close to the edge

No rules here
No fear dear
Six gears are ready to push me on the seat babe
Tonight I'll commit my crime oh yeah!!!

I don't know where my goal is
I run away from all the lies you told me

Now she is taking me to nowhere
This time I left behind me who I am

6. Face And Pay
Pride means never give up
And never say lies
Are you sure to be a right man, from deep down inside

Sometimes it's so easy to hide the reality just for a while
But sooner or later you know we have to face and pay

Masters of our future
Fortune is like a train that you can't catch
Masters of our fate
Put out the hate and now start again

Cry your reasons out loud
Fight for your line
Everything will be clear, under a new light

Sometimes it's so hard to find
The courage to take off the mask
But sooner or later you know we have to face and pay

Masters of our future
Fortune is like a train that you can't catch
Masters of our fate
Put out the hate and now start again

7. Malcolm Grey
My hands are red of blood
But it's not mine
Inside me there's no light and a frozen soul
I can't understand but I like it
Everything is clear but suddenly that piano....
That mesmerizing sound that pushes me to do it again

Can someone tell me if it's true or not
I'm scared by the pleasure I feel
Too thin is the line between dream and reality

Who is playing here??
Oh my God... The same melody
Different is the scene and new is the victim
But the old man playing is still the same
Hey you, now I wanna see your fucking face
Once for all stop it!!!
....No! It's not possible.... Your face is my face.... No

Can someone tell me if it's true or not
I'm scared by the pleasure I feel
Too thin is the line between dream and reality

Can someone tell me if it's true or not
I'm scared by the pleasure I feel
Too this is the line between dream and reality
But now I know it was just a dream.... Or not!?

8. Nothing New
Trying to remember what we've lost
Now I realize
That a new life is born

A very little step ahead
And the bad tales of yesterday (are) behind
Tomorrow won't be easy but
Our shoulders now are strong enough

Nothing new under the sun
Don't look back follow your star
Past is gone open your eyes

Everyone has a path
I wanna ride on mine with an open mind
Nothing is for free here
Sometimes the strength is hard to find

Nothing new under the sun
Don't look back follow your star
Past is gone open your eyes

9. Infidels
Again bodies on the ground
Covered by black shrouds
One more time the holy war has left his scar
But now is heavier than ever was before
Into a school.... Do I need to say more??

A media speculation
The pain here is for sale
My candle keeps on burning

Infidels but so proud about it
In the name of freedom
Preachers without love and compassion
Stay away from us

And now eggheads say the dialogue is the only way
They don't have to dig another grave today
Black widows, killers, pregnant of dynamite
A little comfort is you too will die

A media speculation
The pain here is for sale
My candle keeps on burning

Infidels but so proud about it
In the name of freedom
Preachers without love and compassion
Stay away from us

10. Meanings
White - The sheet is empty as my head
I try to full them both but I'm becoming mad

Give me a starting point, a hint
As soon as possible my friends

Everyone is looking for meanings
But sometimes there is no need
Free to decide to write following our moods

Black - My ink is flowin' from my pen
I should tell ya about a lost love or dragon's tale

I found, if you have no words to say
Don't say nothing and it's ok!

Everyone is looking for meanings
But sometimes there is no need
Free to decide to write following our moods
It's an escape from what we have around

1. The Shooting Star
Eleven years have been passing by
But dust didn't cover your memories
Time didn't make it all fade away
Pictures of something we've lived
They're all still there...

Walking on the edge of forever, like a feather in the wind
We've no chance to choose, and the breeze is our guiding light, in the night

We're like a shooting star, leaving signs on the horizon
Out of the dark we run
While we're chasing our chance to break free

Eleven years, would you say so much?
Time didn't warn us while running
What has remained of all that we had
It got covered by sands of time
(But) it still lived in our minds

Reaching for the edge of forever, unlike feathers in the wind
We refused to be taken everywhere the wind was blowing, walking on our path

We're like a shooting star, leaving signs on the horizon
Out of the dark we run
While we're chasing our chance to break free

We're like a shooting star, leaving signs on the horizon
Out of the dark we run
While we're chasing our chance to be free

Walking on the edge of forever..
Waiting for a sign..
Walking we are feathers in the wind..
Waiting just for a little sign

2. A Chance
Lie down
Close your eyes and start dreaming on
Call me, in the rays of the moonlight I'll come

Cry now, and spit out all the sorrow
Through pain, you made it to survive
Tears fall, while memories are calling
This life just broke your heart in two

Before the dawn announces a new day
Tonight we have a chance to live our dream
And make it happen to meet again

I'm here, from a place out of memory
Hold me, cause tonight we've a chance to be free

The sound of stars is like some music
Your voice is whispering my name
Go back to dreamland and just call me
Then wait, I promise I'll be there

Before the dawn tears this night away
I'll find again the way to reach your soul
And once again I'll make it through the maze

I'm here, from a place out of memory
Hold me, cause tonight we've a chance to be free

Before the dawn tears this night away
I'll find again the way to reach your soul
And once again I'll make it through the maze

I'm here, from a place out of memory
Hold me, cause tonight we've a chance to be free

3. Like Shadows In The Dark
Dear, I'm here
Look at me
After so many years I'm once again with you
Now put your hand on my heart

We were free and we were one
Tonight it's you and me and no one else around
Come and stay here by my side, and let's fly again

Floating
We're like shadows in the dark
Reaching, for some freedom
Your eyes
Are still crystals shining bright
They banished me from heaven
You gave me light

Lost in time
I tried to reach you
I crossed the mists of time, the trip was long and tough
My love for you took me back to life again

Floating
We're like shadows in the dark
Reaching, for some freedom
Your eyes
Are still crystals shining bright
They banned me out of heaven
You gave me light

Floating
We're like shadows in the dark
Reaching, for some freedom
Your eyes
Are still crystals shining bright
They banned me out of heaven
You gave me light

We all live in the dark
But our hope still alive
 
We all live in the dark
But our hope still alive
 
We all live in the dark
But our hope still alive
 
We all live in the past
But our hope still alive
 
We all live in the dark
But our hope still alive

4. Princess Of The Night
There's no time to waste
They're still on our path
Like hound dogs with their prey
But they can't read your mind
Princess of the night
Still your dreams are safe

Open gates of dreamland
That's the only way to escape

Princess of the night
Can you hear they're coming?
We must run tonight
Don't you stop running
Through the gates of dreams
We will find salvation
In a lake of tears
They will sink and drown

So they are fed by hate
They can't stand our pride
(As) We don't fear their might

The skies will break and fall
Till they find us all
Bounded by their lore

Open gates of dreamland
That's the only way to escape

Princess of the night
Can you hear they're coming?
We must run tonight
Don't you stop running
Through the gates of dreams
We will find salvation
In a lake of tears
They will sink and drown

Princess of the night
Can you hear they're coming?
We must run tonight
Don't you stop running
Through the gates of dreams
We will find salvation
In a lake of tears
They will sink and drown

5. Sailors Of Time
Follow me
Where the time's no rules
Where the space is not a bound
Come with me
In the dusk we'll dance
While the stars will glitter all around

We will fly
Through the bluest skies
To the infinite together
No more pain
Running inside your veins
We will make our way to heaven

Hands of the watch
Are stopping tonight
We're going back home
Like sailors of time

Drops of dew
In the morning's light
The first dawn of our new life

Hands of the watch
Are stopping tonight
We're going back home
Like sailors of time

Hands of the watch
Are stopping tonight
We're going back home
Like sailors of time

We are sailors

6. To Where We Belong
Crossing the lands
Through the ivory gates of dreams
We start our trip in search for freedom
We push our souls
Through the folds of space and time
In search for hopes we never found

And tonight we won't fail
It is do or die
When tomorrow comes
We will hail to the new sun

Feel the wind on your face
While we ride
It's the cold wind of freedom
Two small points in the sky
Tiny lights
Going back to where we belong

Look at the world
We are leaving it behind
Our trip has started, now we're moving forth

No turning back
From the choices we have made
We're ending now what (we) started years ago

And tonight we won't fail
It is do or die
When tomorrow comes
We will hail to the new sun

Feel the wind on your face
While we ride
It's the cold wind of freedom
Two small points in the sky
Tiny lights
Going back to where we belong

Feel the wind on your face
While we ride
It's the cold wind of freedom
Two small points in the sky
Tiny lights
Going back to where we belong

7. A Midnight Autumn's Dream
I can't forget
When I saw you the first time
It seems a life ago
Still I recall
A single smile from you
And I felt the peace of mind
The storm I had inside
Suddenly turned into quiet

Was it luck, or fate?
I don't know, trust me
But it's real and I won't ever let it go

Nights wouldn't be so beautiful
Without stars, without the moon
And their lights reflecting on the horizon
Shine like those stars for me, would you?
Cause this midnight autumn's dream
Will be perfect if you smile for me tonight

Now take my hand
And let's do the walk of life
Together if you want
Side by side

Now take my hand
And let's do the walk of life
Together if you want
Side by side

Nights wouldn't be so beautiful
Without stars, without the moon
And their lights reflecting on the horizon
Shine like those stars for me, would you?
Cause this midnight autumn's dream
Will be perfect if you smile for me tonight

Was it luck, or fate?
I don't know, trust me
But it's real and I won't ever let it go

Nights wouldn't be so beautiful
Without stars, without the moon
And their lights reflecting on the horizon
Shine like those stars for me, would you?
Cause this midnight autumn's dream
Will be perfect if you smile for me tonight

8. The Morning's Call
Every night comes to an end
And the dark must make way to the incoming light
For how magic was this dream
A new dawn comes in place of the night

Look at the rising sun
It's calling sleepers to wake

Black is turning into blue
Blue will turn then into black in this turnabout

It's time to go, pale moon
The sunlight claims for it's time

When sun rises up
It's time to awake
And leave your dreams with the dying night
Stand up and live
Walk in the new dawn, and hear the morning's call

Turn your head in bed
And be ready to leave the lands of fantasy
Time to go back to reality
But I'll live on inside your mind

It's time to go, pale moon
The sunlight claims for it's time

When sun rises up
It's time to awake
And leave your dreams with the dying night
Stand up and live
Walk in the new dawn, and hear the morning's call

9. In This Void
It was nice, but now I realize you were not here
Seemed so true, (I) still feel you on my skin
In this void I remain

So real to tear down my life
Blinding lucidity that scars me deep inside
If I could freeze the time right now
I'd keep your image safe inside my wounded heart

I never prayed, but in this morning light
Lord, I need your bless
Take this soul or give me back again
All I had last night

So real to tear down my life
Blinding lucidity that scars me deep inside
If I could freeze the time right now
I'd keep your image safe inside my wounded heart

So real to tear down my life
Blinding lucidity that scars me deep inside
If I could freeze the time right now
I'd keep your image safe inside my wounded heart

10. A Painting On The Wall
Like a hall with paintings on the wall
In our mind are living memories
Pictures of our life
They won't ever fade away
Living there for us to see
Whenever we need

Before you wake up
Draw a painting of us together
And keep it for when I'll be gone
Before you awake I'll draw
A picture of me on your wall
So that you won't feel alone

When tomorrow you will cry alone
Dry your tears, don't think of what you've lost
Think of what you had
Take your brushes, do it then
Paint it all before it fades, lost in time

Before you wake up
Draw a painting of us together
And keep it for when I'll be gone
Before you awake I'll draw
A picture of me on your wall
So that you won't feel alone

Before you wake up
Draw a painting of us together
And keep it for when I'll be gone
Before you awake I'll draw
A picture of me on your wall
So that you won't feel alone

1. The Prophet
It was a nite dark 'n' cold
Same old situation on the streets
No one was thinkin' 'bout what should become
When a strange man started to say
Sinners you are you've got no shame for
The evil you've done Lord sweep away this modern Sodom
Save our souls
Cries in downtown The Ground is shakin'
End is near blindin' fear Cries in downtown
No way to run Thy will is done
Eyes full of dread 'roundthat man
The prophet continued his warning
But in between blades of fire From the clouds
Burn everything that he said
Sinners you are now you will pay for The evil you've done
Lord sweep away this modern Sodom
Save our soul

2. Livin' In A Maze
Through the years good 'n' bad times we've walked
Lookin' for a dream that someone stole away
Where is the right way to get out of this maze?
Someone is lost inside it but we won't forget

Everything we had before
Seems to be so far away now there's no anger in our hearts
Just the will to make it better We are on the run again !

No pain livin' in a maze Our fate we face
Always livin' in a maze This time we won't loose the race

How many blind alleys we found along the road
But now is the time to reach the out let soon

3. This World
Too blind to see the truth
Too dumb to remember
What we learned from a past still so near
We forget so easily
Bad winds are blowin' on our peace
Dark wings have bought us to insanity
Is this the time to say our prayers?

Is this the time to take our blames ?
We need just as a language Whitout words or symbols
Something made of a common respect for life

4. Just Soldiers (Stay Down)
Sound of pipes war's all around I'm creepin' on the ground
I wonder why I do this Stay down and load your gun
I don't know if it's worth while I'm near the fighting line
The breath of death is close to me
No way to avoid all this madness around here
Oh my god please tell me what is right
What is the price?
Glory fame and pride
No! I won't obey
Then you'll have to die
The soil is red of our blood
I'm sinkin' in the mud
A sinner voice is saying: Stay down and play your game
Now I'm facing the enemy
But hey, he's the same as me
A man who fights for someone's fault

5. Neverending Rest
Ride In the night Everywhere you feel so lonely
And tangled down
Hi nice and brainy guy You could quickly know our mood and feel
The lost meanings Oh, here your mouse is saying you'll run again
Maybe he's waiting a new dawn
Freedom for sale could mean to touch the sunshine
And now the time has come And everywhere I see your lovely faces
Your rattling honest road Walk by my side
No one live around the end and tears are crystalized
Oh no, angels please Hold in your young hands the sense of mercy
Your thin arms blinded me
Oh, yes your smile will stay here forever
World's turning a new day has come
Unknown freedom will bleed around the sunrise
You know the answer? And everywhere we'll see your lovely ladies
Your rattling honest road

6. Terzinato
This is a new step we are walkin' to a new life
Stupid is trying to a contol the sounds of time
Leave them - live them - grow up and learn
Taste them - keep them - until the end
The goal is still so close 
But heard to reach it
We never loose the hope it's a game of patience
Standin' in the wings ready for our turn
Standin' in the wings the light will shine on us one day
How many people are waitin' to see the show
I feel the adrenaline run into my blood 
Face them - rock them - put on the fire
Amaze them - catch them - until the end

7. Slave To The Night
Let me introduce myself I'm your fear
Do you really know who I am?
I'll be everything you need or dream of
I'll slowly take you to the end So many times I wish I wasn't
Only a shade But at the sunset I feel somethin'
Burn inside me Slave to the night
I can hear your heartbeat while you sleepin'
Greed takes possession of me
Let me sink my teeth into your young throat
Hey don't turn you back to me now
It's so hard to live forever alone
Ther's no rest for me And no love at all
Always lookin' for somethin' I can't have
In this darkness now I'm becomin' mad
'cause I know this nite I will kill again
Now in the end I'm still lookin' for Someone to love
But than the sunset I feel somethin'
Burn inside me

8. Synthetic Paradise
No more ways to hide your face
In a corner you are friend
Please don't give me your claim and lie
Look at me straight in the eys
But tell me where is the fun
You're alone now
How can you waste all your life
You're deep in trouble man
If you wanna stop your bllody mess
Run by our side
The you will live a real world of dream 
Rise your voice 'n' sing with me
Your synthetic paradise
It's the illusion of a moment
It's easyer tha to fight to survive
You won't keep yourself alive

9. Hand In Hand
My mind is clear as the sky, For the first time
I can see what I left behind my shoulders
I don't care if the world keeps on turning
I'll be strong if you stay here by my side
and walkin' hand in hand again
we live our life with just a smile
No words to explain what love can realize
Fragile like a flower and stronger than a storm
Goodbye sun welcome moon my old friend
How I dreamed how I cried under your eyes
I don't care if the rain keeps on falling
I'll be there to repair your every time
No words to explain what love can realize
Fragile like a flower and stronger than a storm
No more dark hours into my heart 
You color my days and that is all I want

10. When I Will Fly Far
My soul is burning now 'cuz years ago you gave me secret sorrows
I've seen the ice through your eyes
How could you've been untrue nice sad and hollow
Bad things crawl inside my heart To live is hard now and
I' getting son mad Blood will flow please life return
Oh I don't if winds still blow
And where I will heal my wounds
But you'll give me warmth again 
When I'll get home Or when I will fly far
Crazyness start to creep
Day by day my rage seems to be hallowed
But I will fly so high
And from now on shout
Should be in your honour
Bad things crawl deep inside my heart
To live is hard now and
I'm getting so mad
Blood will flow please life return

1. Bullets
I saw misery and scorn
From who has no respect for life
They are trying to make us slaves
Through false religions and lies
No one is saved 'cause it's all programmed
The line between fake and real
Is so thin, impossible to see
Nothing is free

We are running out of time
And all our certainties are shattered and scattered
Blood is turned into mud
There is nothing to say
The damage is done

The last bow to a stunned crowd
And an AK starts to sing
Bullets are filling the air
Cowardice has been stronger than this
No one is saved 'cause it's all programmed
The line between fake and real
It's so thin impossible to see
Nothing is free

[Solo: Olaf, Andrea, Oleg]

No one is saved 'cause it's all programmed
The line between fake and real
It's so thin impossible to see
Nothing is free

We are running out of time
And all our certainties are shattered and scattered
Blood is turned into mud
There is nothing to say
The damage is done

2. Still Alive
We are surrounded by the same old rules
All in a row in a production line
Just waiting for the stamp that says 'approved'
An army of silent replicants

The wheels of life are turning
Running rings around
A preset deadline
Impossible to evade

No matter if it's near or far away
Our goal is like a dream
Still alive 'til our heart dances its magic dance
No matter if they want us deaf and blind
We are free to fall or reach the highest sky

This falling rain has washed away the stains
The slate is clean but only for a while
A picture really clear comes in our minds
But someone wants to draw a different line

The wheels of life are turning
Running rings around
A preset deadline
Impossible to evade

No matter if it's near or far away
Our goal is like a dream
Still alive 'til our heart dances its magic dance
No matter if they want us deaf and blind
We are free to fall or reach the highest sky

[Solo: Olaf / Andrea / Oleg]

No matter if it's near or far away
Our goal is like a dream
Still alive 'til our heat dances its magic dance
No matter if they want us deaf or blind
We are free to fall or reach the highest sky

3. Take On My Legacy
Angel's voices are calling me
Don't know if I'm strong enough
I'll be there to see and hear
If the thunder roars again
The anger in me is still alive
I'm brandishing my sword against all odds

There's a light coming from a mountain high
From a crack I can see the demons' eyes
Like a shadow I'll reach their forbidden lair
To bring them my rage

The wolves in me are now unleashed
The gods above are blessing me
If I don't come back don't cry
Get ready to take on my legacy

There's a light coming from a mountain high
From a crack I can see the demons' eyes
Like a shadow I'll reach their forbidden lair
To bring them my rage

[Solo: Olaf / Andrea]

There's a light coming from a mountain high
From a crack I can see the demons' eyes
Like a shadow I'll reach their forbidden lair
To bring them my rage

4. A New Dream
All around things are changing
For everyone of us
I feel the need to rest my heart and mind

Go, if you wanna go
And never look back in anger
But if you wanna stay
Measure all your words, you don't have to complain
Sooner or later
It'll be your turn again
Are you experienced to hold the reins?

Don't be afraid today
Do not be scared to change the road you're on

No! Maybe you don't know
Our brain is infected
Stop look into my eyes
And tell me where we went wrong
Once and for all
Sooner or later
It'll be your turn again
Are you experienced to keep the route?

Don't be afraid today
Do not be scared to change the road you're on

[Solo: Oleg / Olaf / Andrea]

Don't be afraid today
Do not be scared to change the road you're on

Don't be afraid today
The sands are flowing and a new dream will come for each one of us

5. Someone Says
I woke up in silence
With another day of life ahead
I'm breathing I'm feeling like before a hurricane
No boredom and no turning back
We start again

From the darkness to the morning light
Looking for the grace I left behind
Someone says I need to turn the page
But I can't

Rain's falling on wet ground
Nothing seems like yesterday
I'm rolling my two dices
Trying to fool and change my fate
No boredom and no turning back
Life's ahead

From the darkness to the morning light
Looking for the grace I left behind
Someone says I need to turn the page
But I can't

[Solo: Olaf / Andrea / Oleg]

From the darkness to the morning light
Looking for the grace I left behind
Someone says I need to turn the page
But I can't

From the darkness to the morning light
Trying to fix the pain I left behind
Someone says I need to turn the page
Now I can

6. Random Logic
[Instrumental]
7. Architecture Of A God
There's an old man in the night
Sitting all alone, in the moonlight
...and there he smiles

On an old and broken chair
Staring at a wall he tries to catch
The reflections of all his thoughts
To understand the Architecture of a God

He's an old man, from a far past
But when he was a boy he used to dream
Of himself old, sitting right there
At the same wall, wondering

And he wonders if it's all just a joke
Or it's another dream he's having as a boy

Past and future glide
Both are parts of the same line
Drawn by an inscrutable Architect
It depends on which way you decide to walk that line
While the Architect sets our lives

Many hopes and dreams we have
While we're young and long seems life
...we've plenty of time

And the memories then come
In a back and forth game
We all run, while He's working upon us
In this big Architecture of a God

Like that old, from a far past
We were boys who used to dream many lives
Building ten, a hundred million
While stars are dancing all around

Will we wonder if it was all just a joke?
Will we try to read our life from right to left?

Past and future glide
Both are parts of the same line
Drawn by an inscrutable Architect
It depends on which way
You decide to walk that line
While the Architect sets our life

[Solo: Andrea / Olaf]

Will we wonder if it was just a joke?
Will we try to read our life from right to left?

Past and future glide
Both are parts of the same line
Drawn by an inscrutable Architect
It depends on which way you decide to walk that line
While the Architect sets our lives

8. Children
[Instrumental][originally by Robert Miles]
9. Those Days
Between space and time there's only a this curtain
You will find me there just for a little while
Everything was lost or at least is what I thought
It's not over yet but the worst is over
Call my name and the sunshine wakes me up
From a winter's tale that froze all my hopes

My heart was trapped in a block of marble
For so long
Your love has carved it out from that cold stone
And I still bless those days

I never understand, what's forever for
An eternal flame weaker than a candle
Feel my pain that now is vanishing
Finally I can breathe and I give myself to you

My heart was trapped in a block of marble
For so long
Your love has carved it out from that cold stone
And I still bless those days

[Solo: Andrea / Olaf]

My heart was trapped in a block of marble
For so long
Your love has carved it out from that cold stone
And I still bless those days

10. We Belong To Yesterday
From the biosphere to the deepest sea
We search for freedom and serenity
Our wings are strong enough to bare the winds
Blowing as they never did before
Don't you forget our name, it's carved in hard stone
Don't let our faces fade away, be gone
Louder our chant resounds, tonight we're coming
Listen to what we're crying

We belong to yesterday
And we face the future but we know that
We belong to yesterday
We are shadows from the past but this time
We come again to stay

Time is almost due but no one seems to care
This road is bringing us straight to nowhere
Anyway I will be there to take your hand
Showing you the path to the new world
Did you forget our names?
They're carved in those stones
Did you just let our faces fade away?
Open your eyes up wide, 'cause we're back for good
Listen to what we're crying

We belong to yesterday
And we face the future but we know that
We belong to yesterday
We are shadows from the past but this time
We come again to stay

[Solo: Olaf / Andrea]

We belong to yesterday
And we face the future but we know that
We belong to yesterday
We are shadows from the past but this time
We come again to stay

11. Stardust And Ashes
Scream from the top of your lungs
All your despair
Hear the echo of your regrets
There is an inner voice that says
Don't complain!
You're made of stardust and ashes my friend

Is this the beginning or the end?
History repeats itself over and over
Is this heaven's gate or just the hell?
We'll find it out between the dusk and darkness

Feel deep down inside the pain you have caused
Stop to blame someone else, face your guilt
Cry a river of tears to save your soul
Pay for your dues there is so much to do

Is this the beginning or the end?
History repeats itself over and over
Is this heaven's gate or just the hell?
We'll find it out between the dusk and darkness

[Solo: Andrea / Olaf / Nik / Oleg]

Is this the beginning or the end?
History repeats itself over and over
Is this heaven's gate or just the hell?
We'll find it out between the dusk and darkness

12. Diamond
[Solo: Olaf]

We are like diamonds
All of us, we're the most precious thing
We could shine like no others
But sometimes, some of us end up unfinished

Dirty stones to be thrown
A pale hint of what we could have been
While our poor lives carry on
But we know we could have been

...a diamond
