Deceiver Of The Gods

Since I was born they have kept me down,
They have forced me to conform.
I will tear down their holy crown in a vengeful thunder storm,

I loathe their bloody righteous ways
It fills me with despise,
Fuelling flames of violent rage,
I will be their world's demise.

[Chorus:]
Asgård's always been my home
But I'm of different blood
I will overthrow the throne
Deceiver!
Deceiver of the gods!

All this rage, and all this hate,
It burns me deep inside,
And still it is, the only thing, keeping me alive.
Dark ambition within my heart and it's aching to break free
The one true nature of my soul, the giant lives in me.

Kneel!
You all shall kneel to me!
Or death will set you free!
You all shall kneel to me!

Fall!
You all shall fall to me!
Vengeance will be sweet!
You all shall fall to me!

[Chorus:]
Asgård's always been my home
But I'm of different blood
I will overthrow the throne
Deceiver of the gods!

[Chorus:]
Asgård's always been my home
I'm born from different blood
I've come to overthrow the throne
Deceiver!
Deceiver of the gods!
Deceiver of the gods!

As Loke Falls

Yeah!

Heimdall gazes east
A sail has caught his eye
He lifts his hand and sounds the horn
The undead army has arrived

Here comes Nagelfar
With Laufey's son on board
He brings chaos, hate and wrath
He brings the war to end all wars

Heimdall knows his fate
The end of all nine worlds
It's what the Vala has foreseen
He knows that everything shall burn

Facing Lopt's deceit
Now they finally meet
The champion and his enemy
On Vigrid's plains they'll find defeat

Their swords meet in a mighty clash
War cries sound, horns they blast
Their eager weapons whip and thrash
This day when all shall end

The lords of war are equal strong
This battle frantic and forlorn
The blades sing a macabre song
This day when all shall end

Heimdall's blade bites burning sharp
As it cuts through flesh and bone
Blood comes gushing from the wound
As Loke's head falls tumbling
Rolling to the burning ground

Father Of The Wolf

So he found the heart in barren land
It was beating, still alive
He held it gently in his hand
And looked up to the sky

With evil thoughts of vicious kind
And sinister disdain
His thoughts of bringing back to life
The witch that died in flames

[Chorus 2x:]
Serpent's kin
Born of sin
Dark within
Father of the wolf!

He then devoured Gullveig's heart
And she was born again
They brought to life an evil force
A beast that can't be tamed

With dark deception in his soul
Betrayal of the gods
The bane of Oden now is born
Born of evil blood

[Chorus 2x:]
Serpent's kin
Born of sin
Dark within
Father of the wolf!

They brought to life a malicious force
A vile beast that cannot be tamed
Fimbultýr's nemesis now is born
A vile beast that can't be restrained

Dark!
Deception in his
Soul!
Betrayal of the
Gods!
Oden's bane is
Born!
Born of evil blood!

[Chorus 2x:]
Serpent's kin
Born of sin
Dark within
Father of the wolf

Born of sin

Shape Shifter

I was born of giant's blood
Raised in Asgård, the home of gods
I am the master of disguise
For this trait I've gained your prise

Fast in thought, quicker tongue
Brawl with me and you'll get stung
I am the master of deceit
My words bind or set you free

[Chorus:]
I am the walker on the wind
The shape shifter
Two-faced words
And a lying grin
The shape shifter

You call me evil; curse my name
But you only have yourselves to blame
Order needs its anarchy
Balance through calamity

We mixed our blood in olden days
Now I wander like a stray
We were brothers, now estranged
I will have my sweet revenge

My words are poison to your ears
I say the words you fear
Still you know it is the truth you hear
Ragnarök is drawing near

There you sit in Aegir's hall
Waiting for the coming fall
Council of the now condemned
Twilight of both gods and men

Face the facts; you're old and weak
Empty words are all you speak
No escape, there's no return
The universe shall bleed and burn

[Chorus:]
I am the eagle in the sky
The shape shifter
Vicious wolf
Howling in the night
The shape shifter
I am the walker on the wind
The shape shifter
Two-faced words
And a lying grin
The shape shifter
I am the eagle in the sky
The vicious wolf
Howling in the night
I am the walker on the wind
Lying words,
With an honest grin
The shape shifter


5. Under Siege


Outside these walls
An army awaits
But in these halls
We feel safe

Countless attacks
We have repelled
They won't turn back
They cannot be quelled

[Chorus:]
Supplies are running low
Starvation now awaits
Reinforcements will not show
The day is much too late

Broken and weak
Never give in
Prospects are bleak
We can't win

There is no hope
No time for lament
End of the rope
Our lives are spent

We have held out for months
Hoping for relief
Our fortress now our tomb
And salvation now our grief
We have held out for months
Waiting for relief
Our fortune's now our own
This is destiny

[Chorus:]
Supplies are running low
Starvation now awaits
Reinforcements never showed
As the daylight starts to fade
There's nothing left to lose
We have run out of time
There is nothing left to choose
Except how we shall die

Open the gates!
Now we attack!
Ride into fate!
No turning back!

Stand by the King!
To glory we ride!
Weapons and shield!
Together we die!

All is lost now!
Show no fear now!
All the world shall know our bravery!

All is lost now!
Show no fear now!
One last charge for death or victory!

Blood Eagle


Yeah!

Look to my burning eyes
Plead for your worthless life
All remorse I had has died
And all I have is hate inside

You took my soul from me
You took my family
You killed them all ferociously
Now this is what I give to thee

[Chorus:]
Carved upon your naked back
Blood eagle!
Skinned alive your ribs are cracked
Blood eagle!
Still alive you gasp for air
As panic strikes your eyes they stare
Terror grips your dying heart
Blood eagle!

Helpless on the ground
Hands and feet tightly bound
In my eyes no mercy found
My sharp knife starts to carve around

Penetrate your naked skin
Rip flesh and dig within
With a pleased and twisted grin
I spread your lungs like eagle's wings

The burning grief is tormenting me
The hate I feel is destroying me
Only vengeance will give me peace
Only vengeance will set my spirit free

[Chorus:]
Carved upon your naked back
Blood eagle!
Skinned alive your ribs will crack
Blood eagle!
Still alive you gasp for air
As panic strikes your eyes will stare
Slow death grips your tortured heart
Blood eagle!
Blood eagle!
Blood eagle!


7. We Shall Destroy


Sword and spear
Wall of shields
Standing strong
On this their chosen battle field

Form the lines
Shield by shield
Side by side
We're marching into destiny

March as one
Don't look back
Oden's sons
Attack!

Unleash hell! Do not repent!
Warfare grants us no lament
Let your weapons slash and tear
This is no place for fear

Hold the lines! Move as one!
In unity our victory's won
Our shields will form a mighty wall
United we shall never fall

Fear will not pierce our hearts
Though swords and arrows will
Victory is our reward
For all the blood we spill
We didn't come to waste our lives
Like pawns in a savage game
Our spirits, spears
And shields are linked
In a much stronger chain

March as one
Don't look back
Oden's sons
Attack!

[2x]
All are one
And one is all
Side by side
The battle calls
All are one
And one is all
Shield by shield
We'll never fall

Unleash hell! Do not repent!
Warfare grants us no lament
Let your weapons slash and tear
This is no place for fear

Charge with force! Break their ranks!
No remorse, crush their flanks!
Pulverize their human wall!
We shall destroy!


8. Hel


Welcome to my humble home
Your soul is mine to keep
There are no walls of rock and stone
Yet no one ever leaves

Those who die of age and plague
Are welcomed in my court
Murderers, miscreants
Will linger here and rot

Those who die inglorious
And those who die in shame
They are all sent to my dark halls
They all shall fear my name

[Chorus:]
Here hunger is your plate
Here famine is your knife
Here you will forever dwell
I welcome you to Hel

I welcome you to Hel

Now here you are in my cold realm
You are my honoured guest
At the banquette of the dead
Your soul will never rest

Your soul is mine to keep.
Your soul is mine to keep.
And you will never leave.
And you will never leave.

[Chorus:]
Here sickness is your bed
Here ruin is your fell
Here you will forever dwell
I welcome you to
Here hunger is your plate
Here famine is your knife
Here you will forever dwell
I welcome you to Hel


9. Coming Of The Tide


Racing 'cross the arctic lands
A mounted legion
Under my command
We're a brutal force
No men can withstand
Total havoc is at hand

[Chorus:]
See the black crows circle high
Waiting for brave men to die
They sense the coming of the tide
When opposition's swept aside

The fateful message
Reached us months ago
That our home was under siege
And since that day
We've been heading north
Our kinsmen needed our relief

As we near our fortress walls
Black smoke is rising to the sky
Burnt black ruins
Of our father's halls
And corpses greet our tired eyes

What madness led them to attack
Victory could not be won
They must've known
There was no turning back
And now they all are gone
No woman, child or man was spared
Their bodies lying where they fell
Suffering, anguish and despair
As they went through living hell

So now we're on the ride again
And vengeance is
Our newfound path
We draw our strength
From grief and pain
These bastards shall know
Our endless wrath

[Chorus:]
See the black crows circle high
Waiting for brave men to die
This is the coming of the tide
When opposition's swept aside


10. Warriors Of The North


We were the warriors of the north
Notorious and brave
We'd never lost a fight in war
We feared not the grave

The ruler of this northern court
My brother, lord, king
He always had our loyal swords
But we would feel his sting

The aging king had no descendants
No heir to take his throne
It filled his soul with fear
Transcendent
That next in line was my first-born

The king's heart grew
Full of dark deception
Full of foul conspiracy
This was when dark days
Had their inception
And we fell to his vile deceit

Robbed of arms, robbed of pride
But he spared our lives
The fear he had of Oden's wrath
Held his vengeful knife

With hearts so cold we left our homes
Banished from our land
A life in shame, a life in grief
Until we rise again

Winters come, winters pass
Twenty wasted years
We're aging men, our youth is gone
We will shed no tears

Winters come and winters pass
Twenty years have gone
Like a dream we fade away
Into oblivion

We are the warriors of the north
Notorious and brave
We're old but strong as before
And we don't fear the grave

From the south an army rises
They ride under cross of gold
From the shades we're called
In a time of crisis
To defend the king now weak and old

As the flames of warfare rage higher
We feel our destiny's embrace
We are aging men of an old empire
Now we can see Valhalla's gates

We!
March again
First in line
To reach Valhalla's mighty gates

We!
March again
March to fight
To reach Valhalla's mighty
We!
March again
Give our lives
To reach Valhalla's
Mighty royal gates"Där tog en nordlig vind
skeppet, så att kungen
ombord fördes med
till strid mot två kungar
De djärva kungarna
Hälsade med pilskott
Ordlöst i striden.
Sköldarnas buller räckte."

Blood red bows plough the waves
Dragon heads grin
Twenty ships with Norsemen braves
Riding the northern wind

They left their shores at early dawn
As a red sun was rising in the east
An ancient sign of coming storm
Thunder of sword and shield

Sails appear in the south
Now every man prepare
The sea will be colored by blood
Battle is drawing near

A mighty fleet of forty ships
Two kings bring lethal steel
No words spoken between enemies
Just thunder of sword and shield

A rain of arrows darkens the sun
A cloud of wood and steel
Through shields and flesh the arrows run
Bringing warriors to their knees

A war-cry loud as heimdal's horn
Fills the vibrating air
This is the place where heroes are born
And where death is always near

Here it comes the mighty storm
Every man attacks
Now is when heroes are born
There is no turning back


2. Where Death Seems To Dwell


"Through a dark and desolate valley he walks
Pale, flickering fires light the way
Along an ice cold river lies his path
The sky is of darkest grey

A cold wind pierce through his bones
And the sharp rocks cut his feet
His clothes and skin are ripped by thorns
His eyes appear to bleed"

The land is dead and dry
The water is poisonous
Unknown creatures howling to the sky
Blood chilling and ravenous

The air is thick and dense
A smell of rotting flesh
Every breath is like one thousand knives
Cutting through his chest

Black birds of prey circle the sky
He hears the shadows moan
He sees pale faces pass him by
But he walks this path alone

Darkness fills his heart with chilling fear
A nameless fear he cannot quell
How did he ever end up here?
This place where death seems to dwell

He repeats the question in his weary mind
The riddle gives him no rest
Yet he knows the answer deep inside
He's been touched by the chill of death

Enchanting voices urge him on
Through he wants to turn around
They sing to him with soothing words
A chilling, frighting sound

A cold blue light shimmer ahead
Where a mountain reaches for the sky
Nidafiell, mountain of the dead
Terrifying it's might

He approach the gates
his heart is cold
He understands all to well
She awaits him
The truth unfolds
He's been sent to Nifelhel


3. The Fate Of Norns


I feel a chill in my heart
Like lingering winter cold
I and my son are torn apart
He was just 6 winters old

My first-born was he
And the last of my kin
The last one to carry my name
Death smiled at him its deadly grin
There is no one for me to blame

The fate of Norns await us all
There is no way to escape
The day to answer Oden's call
Or walk through hel's gate

I carry him to my ship
He seems to be asleep
But the deep blue colour of his lips
Is enough to make me weep

No man should have to bury his child
Yet this has been my share
The tears i shed run bitter and wild
It's a heavy burden to bear

His body feels so light in my arms
His skin is pale as snow
Yet his weight feels heavy in my heart
As my sadness continues to grow

Allfather!
What fate has been given me?
Why must I suffer?
Why must I feel this pain?
Allfather!
LIfe has lost it's meaning to me
I think I'm going insane!

I lay him down on a pyre
A burial worthy a king
And as I lie down by his side
I hear the weaving norns sing

The fate of Norns await us all
There is no way to escape
The day to answer Oden's call
Or walk through hel's gate

The fate of Norns await us all
I know this to be true
It's time to answer Odens's call
My son, he calls for me and you


4. The Pursuit Of Vikings


The warming sun returns again
And melts away the snow
The sea is freed from icy chains
Winter is letting go

Standing on the ocean side
We can hear the waves
Calling us out with tide
To sail into our fate

Oden! Guide our ships
Our axes, spears and swords
Guide us through storms that whip
And in brutal war

Our ships await us by the shore
Time has come to leave
Our country, family and homes
For riches in the east

Some of us won't return
But that won't bring us down
Our fate is written in the web
Woven by the Norns

A ram is sacrificed
Across the longship's bow
And as we set our sails
A strong breeze starts to blow

It carries us out to sea
With hope of fame and pride
And glorious all will be
That with sword in hand will die

Oden! Guide our ships
Our Axes, spears and swords
Guide us through storms that whip
And in brutal war

Oden! Guide our ships
Our axes, spears and swords
Guide us through storms that whip
And in brutal war


5. Valkyries Ride


Soon a new day will be spawned
Scattered fires glow
Soon first blood will be drawn
And dying ambers glow

They await the suns first rays
Anticipation running high
The Norns are counting numbered days
Hear the war-cry rise

See the Valkyries ride!
See the Valkyries ride!

They meet upon this hallowed field
Now the end is near
Two armies not about to yield
The smell of death in the air

This field has served as battle ground
Since the dawn of this world
Through the years a lot of blood
Has been poured into this earth

Warrior's eyes full of purest rage
Steel cutting flesh
Spilling guts and severing heads
Sending men to their death

Ride, ride, ride Valkyries
Ride, ride, ride Valkyries

The screams of dying men
The comfort in their eyes
Here they come, by Oden sent
See the Valkyries ride

Fallen men lie all around
Their dead eyes look to the sky
And as the swordplay rambles on
They see the Valkyries ride


6. The Beheading Of A King


A mighty fleet came across the strait
But Erik was prepared
Five hundred Germans had come to his aid
On horseback with their spears

The fleet was carrying two thousand men
Eager to draw blood
But as they were about to land
Erik released his heards

One thousand men and five hundred horsemen
Came charging down the beach
When the sea-king saw this force
He gave order to retreat

All obeyed except one ship
It held the king's own son
He despised the thought of flight
And attacked on his own

The Danish fleet had to turn around
They charged King Erik's men
But it was too late to save his son
His life was already spent

The fighting continued bloody and fierce
And the bloodshed was immense
Two thousand warriors died that day
Most of them were Danes

The Danish king was captured
Most of his guards were dead
For a ransom he was released
Then his people took his head


7. Arson


They came riding at first light
Fifty men armed to the teeth
The sounding horn called us out to fight
We went to meet them with our steel

Outnumbered yet we fought
But soon we were overrun
We took refuge in our home
Our downfall had just begun

They attacked our home, we kept them out
Defending ourselves with spear and bow
We took them out one by one
As the rising autumn sun glowed

There was twenty dead on each side
When we first smelled something burn
We heard them laughing from outside
Taunting us with spiteful words

They set the house on fire
In order to smoke us out
Only five of us were still alive
And our time was running out

Raging flames surrounded us all
Our home was under siege
Crumbling roof and burning walls
There was no way to break free

As we were all about to die
We swore a sacred oath
Revenge would be claimed if someone survived
And we sealed the oath in blood

The roof caved in and cleared a path
A way out of the flames
It was decided that I'd go first
As we made for our escaped

Suddenly the walls came down
And trapped the rest inside
My closest friends died that day
Only I made it out alive

8. Once Sealed In Blood


It's five years since I left this land
Since I left my friends to burn
Five years making bitter plans
Preparing my return

All this time my hatred's grown
The one thing on my mind
The hate in me is all I've known
The one thing keeping me alive

Bold words spreads across the land
Bragging tongues speak carelessly
Know they not what is to come
I'll hunt them down restlessly

The oath I swore, once sealed in blood
A seal between loyal friends
I swore before ancient Gods
I will have revenge

I swore! Before my Gods!
An oath! Once sealed in blood

I swore! Before my Gods!
An oath! Once sealed in blood

Now here I stand in pouring rain
As he comes riding down the path
He will learn the meaning of pain
As subject to my endless wrath

He will be the first to pay
For the bragging words he spoke
He'll regret that fateful day
My friends perished in smoke

I swore! Before my Gods!
An oath! Once sealed in blood

I swore! Before my Gods!
An oath! Once sealed in blood

I swore! Before my Gods!
An oath! Once sealed in blood
I swore! Before my Gods!
Once sealed in blood
I swore! Before my Gods!
An oath! Before my Gods!
Once sealed in blood
I swore! Before my Gods!

So here I stand on the road
With cold steel in my hand
As he looks into my unforgiving soul
His tears begins to run

One man down 29 to go
Consider yourselves warned
I'm coming for the rest of you
And will have no remorse

The first man I killed was the earl's right-hand man
When he came to take her away
I ran his own sword straight through his throat
And then I stood there, watching him fade

The first blood I spilled was the blood of a varg
I had to wipe his smile away
I was not yet a man, nor was I a boy
But still, I made that bastard pay

So I left him there, on the stable floor
Bathing in a pool of his own blood
My one and only choice was to flee this land
To leave this wretched place for good

I am an outcast
All alone
I'm a nomad without home

I am an outlaw
I'm disowned
And I am no man's son

Through the cold midwinter nights on a southbound winding path
The stars and moon my only light; and the earl's men closing fast
I swore that I'd return; that I would see him burn
I will live it in my dreams; the smell, the blood, his dying screams

To my father I was dead, he took his hand from me
He drove me away, I was shunned
My one and only choice was to leave this land
To become the pagan they would hunt

I am an outcast
All alone
I'm a nomad without home

I am an outlaw
I'm disowned
And I am no man's son

I am an outcast
All alone
I'm a nomad without home

I am an outlaw
I'm disowned
And I am no man's son

I journey through this frozen land on my own
There's no shelter anywhere down the road
When this mystic wanderer comes around
And the dying hope in my heart starts to grow

This vagrant offers help when there was none
To this outlawed murder on the run
Through the snowy mountains we roam
Mu journey towards freedom has now begun

On the run
All alone
Hope is gone
Wanderer

A blizzard hit with blinding force
The wind cut through the bone
And amidst the blur of snow
I found myself alone

Freezing winds brought me down
I laid myself to rest
In the deep, chilling cold
I knew I'd freeze to death

Left alone I had no choice
But to accept my fate
When the wanderer returned
Then I knew that my life was saved

On the run
All alone
Hope is gone
Wanderer

On the run
Not alone
Hope returns
Wanderer

Drifting alone upon the dragon ship
Eerily still, no winds that tear or whip
Silence deafens, the sea is mirror calm
Blood runs like the water from my palm

I'm standing by myself
Abiding
Just me and no one else
No hiding

Horizon crumbles under flaming skies
A shadow screams from thunderclouds up high
Nidhogg comes in winds of burning flames
Cast down war and endless pain

It's coming
Brace myself
I'm ready
It's coming
No escape
Stand steady

Out on this bloody sea I'll face my destiny
Lost in a dreadful dream I'll meet my fate

Out on this blood sea, this is my prophecy
A notion of what's to be, there's no escape

The dragon sweeps down with a roar
Sky and ocean shake
It tears up waves of blood and gore
The longship nearly breaks

Passing just above my head
A stench of putrid death
Rotting flesh of thousands dead
Dwells upon its breath

I turn around
Face myself
Yet it isn't I
With fear and rage
I run me through
As I watch me die!

Out on this bloody sea, I'll face my destiny
Lost in a dreadful dream, I'll meet my fate
Out on this bloody sea, this is my prophecy
A notion of what's to be, there's no escape

Get ready!
Stand steady!

It's coming
Brace myself
Abiding
It's coming
Certain death
No hiding

Winter's lost its grip
The ocean is set free
The ship glides through the broken ice
Out to an open sea

North winds fill the sails
They fly on frothing seas
As hope grows stronger in his heart
It's easier to breathe

Days turn into nights
Nights turn into days
His determination grows
With every breath he takes

There he stands alone, one man against all
With a sword in each hand, soon he will fall
There he stands alone, one man against all
With a sword in each hand, heeding the call

When the reach the Hano bay
There waits a ship of war
Like the bear attacks its prey
It comes at them with force

All men to the oars!
Row for all your worth!
Most likely this will be your last day
On this wretched earth!

The weak they try to run
But he's prepared to fight
One by one his friends are slain
Only he remains

He knows the end is near
They have him in their jaws
When a noble man appears
He tells them, "Withdraw!"

There he stands before him
As the skirmish quells
He offers him,
"Join our crew or join your friends in hell."

There he stands alone, one man against all
With a sword in each hand, and soon he will fall
There he stands alone, one man against all
With a sword in each hand, he's heeding the call

Victory
We fought hard and prevailed
Brutally
We were fighting

Stormy seas
Rolling thunder, piercing hail
Battlefield
Lit by lightning

Eagerly
We filled the waves with enemies
Hungrily
Ravens cawing

Home shore calls
We return on bloody seas
Twilight falls
Darkness crawling

So pour the beer for thirsty men
A drink that they have earned
And pour a beer for those who fell
For those who did not return

Raise your horns!
Raise them up to the sky!
We will drink to glory tonight
Raise your horns for brave fallen friends
We will meet where the beer never ends

No regrets
We went out to war and strife
To protect
King and country

Victory
Honor those who gave their life
Willingly
We will not grieve

So pour the beer for thirsty men
A drink that they have earned
And pour a beer for those who fell
For those who did not return

Raise your horns!
Raise them up to the sky!
We will drink to glory tonight!
Raise your horns!
Raise them up to the sky!
We will drink tonight!

Raise your horns!
Raise them up to the sky!
We will drink to glory tonight
Raise your horns
For brave fallen friends
We will meet in Valhalla again

Whirling dust in morning air
Two warriors in the ring
With the strength of two great bears
They make their weapons sing

Sparks fly high when steel meets steel
And no one can believe
That these two men are best friends
Not enemies

They lash out with ferocious force
The fight grows more intense
But each avoid the other's sword
As if by seventh sense

Their muscles ache, their bones are sore
But none of them will yield
They fight a two-man practice war
As enemies

Faster!
Stronger!
Fight until your dying breath!
Fiercer!
Harder!
This is a matter of life and death!

Full on fight in training
It's the way of vikings
Every muscle straining
It's the way of the Jomsvikings
These men aim to shatter
It's the way of vikings
This is how we battle
It's the way of the Jomsvikings

Whirling dust in morning air
Two warriors in the ring
With the strength of two great bears
They make their weapons sing

Sparks fly high when steel meets steel
And no one can believe
That these two men are best friends
Not enemies

Sun beats down with intense heat
The swordsmen start to break
Pain shoots through their tired feet
With every step they take

In this fight of iron wills
One man takes a knee
The other goes for the kill
Like an enemy

Faster!
Stronger!
Fight until your dying breath!
Fiercer!
Harder!
This is a matter of life and death!

Full on fight in training
It's the way of vikings
Every muscle straining
It's the way of the Jomsvikings
These men aim to shatter
It's the way of vikings
This is how we battle
It's the way of the Jomsvikings

At dawn's first light
Run for your lives

Viking ships come out of the mist
Ominous sight
Flee or stand fast
You won't last

Warlords invade with axe and blade
Attack at first light
Unstoppable force
No remorse

Under attack, no turning back
You cannot run
Nowhere to hide
No shelter inside

Under attack, no turning back
Slaughter's begun
Nowhere to hid
No shelter inside

Slashing, killing
Thrashing, spilling
Blood for honor, death, and glory!

Out of the night
At dawn's first light
Longships arrive
Run for your lives!

Wounds won't mend your bitter end
Death to all
Flee or fight
No one survives

Bloodshed won't stop
'Til the last drop
You will fall
It matters not how hard you fought

Under attack, no turning back
You cannot run
Nowhere to hide
No shelter inside

Under attack, no turning back
Slaughter's begun
Nowhere to hid
No shelter inside

Slashing, killing
Thrashing, spilling
Blood for honor, death, and glory!

The ships bring terror to these shores
Death and all out war
Their oars are cutting through the waves
Like spades are digging graves

At dawn's first light
Run for your lives

Out of the night
At dawn's first light
Longships arrive
Run for your lives!

They bring him to the shore
His ship is ready made
He will not see them anymore
Here he cannot stay

The brotherhood is gathered
Their faces hard as stone
They have come to take farewell
In silence they mourn

"Our king has left our ranks
a wise and noble man
We owe him loyalty and thanks
He ruled with a steady hand

He will be missed by all
His heart has now been stilled
Tonight he'll dine in Odin's Hall
There he'll drink his fill"

The ship glides gently on the waves
As day turns into night
One thousand burning arrows
Fill the starlit sky

Two ravens on the longship
They spread their pitch-black wings
And lift up to the burning sky
A send-off for a king!

Into flames! The longship burst into flames!
Black smoke is rising high
To the eternal night

Into flames! The whole world burst into flames!
Nothing will be the same
Things will forever change

The flames are raging higher
They gnaw at wood and flesh
Soon the ship will break apart
And sink into the depth

This night we wait in silence
And when the morning breaks
Our king has left this world to walk
Through Valhalla's gates

The odds are stacked against me
Outnumbered three to one
These men are seasoned warriors
But I stand my ground

Waiting
Let them come
Ready
Cut them down

No chainmail for protection
I don't have a shield
Surprise my one advantage
Keeping my sword concealed

Hidden
Out of sight
Ready
Prepared to bite

The first man's coming at me
I am not afraid
The time has finally come now
To introduce my blade

Flashing
Fear its name
Slashing
Feel the pain

This is my sword
We are one and the same
My enemies' woe
Vengeance the name

The blade is swift and ruthless
It deals in death and harm
And as he tries to grab me
It cuts through his arm

First cut
Blood is shed
Dripping
Snow turns red

I've struck fear in their hearts
Now let the slaughter start

This is my sword
We are one in the same
My enemies' woe
Vengeance the name
This is my sword
The dealer of pain
Death of my foe
Vengeance the Game

The next man over reaches
And so he winds up dead
One cut is all that's needed
I removed his head

There's only one left standing
He's lost the will to fight
I point my sword towards him
He quickly takes flight

Running
From my sword
Victory
My reward

This is my sword
We are one and the same
My enemies' woe
Vengeance the name
This is my sword
The dealer of pain
Death of my foe
Vengeance my aim

Years of wait are over now
She's almost in my grasp
Now I will fulfill my vow
She will be mine at last

I feel him near
The boy estranged has now returned a full grown man,
But still I fear that nothing's changed
He simply does not understand

Come with me
I'll set you free
And I'll show you
What your life could be

You can't see
That I am free
My life is mine, not yours.
So leave me be

Through forests deep, over mountains high
I've crossed the waves for her
In shadows dark, this cursed night
My thoughts and memories stir

I've left the memories
Of our youth behind
I don't know what he hopes to find
In the shadows he waits for me
For a dream that cannot be

Come with me
I'll set you free
And I'll show you
What your life could be

You can't see
That I am free
My life is mine, not yours.
So leave me be

She refuses to leave
So I grab her by force

I pull the knife I've concealed
I put the edge to his throat

Shocked by the attack
I can feel her final words sear

Leave and never come back
Or I'll cut you ear to ear

You can't see
That I am free
My life is mine, not yours.
So leave me be

I'll set you free
He said to me
And I'll show you what your life could be
I am free
She said to me
My life is mine, not yours.
So leave me be

A thick fog lies ahead
The ocean's deadly calm
Their ship glides on the silent waves
Into the unknown
He cannot turn around
For him it's much too late
He puts his back into the oar
And rows towards his fate

The ship cuts through
The milk white mist
Through the blind they clearly hear
The oar strokes of their mighty fleet
Battle's drawing near
His heart pounds loud and wild
He's waited for this day
Then suddenly a dragon's head
Appears out of the haze

Back on the Northern shores
Just as he once swore
He vowed to return
And to make them burn

Then a Northern wind picks up
It sweeps the mist away
A might viking fleet appears
Patiently they wait
"Death or victory!"
Words by which they stand
No turning back! In for the kill!
Led by thy command!

"All men grab your swords and shields
The enemies lay ahead!
We'll make this bay our battlefield
and fill the waves with dead!"
Darkness then descends
Day turns into night
A massive cloud of thousand arrows
Fills the misty sky

With violent force
The two fleets crash
The battle now begins
Cries of war as weapons clash
Uncertain who will win

Thunder rolls 'cross the waves
Lightning cracks the sky
Clouds release hail big as grapes
As arrows are let fly

Hear the berserks roar!
They call to mighty Thor!
The fury in their raging eyes
Will burn forever more
Hear the weapons sing!
Feel the arrows sting!
They climb onto the Earl's great ship
And begin to swing

The fight is fierce as they attack
With sword and axe, no guts, no glory!
Arrow pierced, they won't back down
They battle on with heart and fury
Then it turns
The flanking ships give way
And soon they are embattled
Standing firm! Fight 'til death!
They refuse to die like cattle

Fighting for his life
No holds barred
So close to revenge
Close but yet so far

Then he stands before him
It's like the battle fades
He sees his father's eyes
As he's struck into the waves

Back on Northern shores
Just as he once swore
He has met his fate
In these cold dark waves

He looks to clouds up high
A dead and distant stare
She comes out of the light
See the chariot flare
Standing on the shore
He hears her silent call
Freja leads him through the door
Into the great hall
As his life's blood leaving
I hold my son, my only son
And tears fill my burning eyes

While his skin turns pale as snow
Butchered he lies here bleeding in my arms
Slewn by the men of the single god
Hatred burns in my chest

Rain falls from a raging heaven
The wind howls like wolves at the moon
I will seek my vengeance for my son
I swear I'll avenge my first born one
I ride fast through the woods
My friends are by my side
Dark hatred burns in my eyes
"Slaves of hvitekrist today you die!"

"Mäktiga gudar,
i gyllene salen.
Hjälp mig i striden
mot sondräparna,
Den höge skall
för huggen hämnas
och blod skall gäldas
i blod"

Our cloaks fly in the wind
As we ride in the cold dark night
We're closing in our enemies
We rage in our hearts burning bright

The clouds scatter in the northern wind
A full moon rides the pitch black sky
"Now, hounds of Hvitekrist,
your time has come to die!"

"Kneel before my sword!
No mercy! Your time has come to die!
This is the ride for vengeance!"


2. The Dragon's Flight Across The Waves


Alone he stands in the doorway
His family still asleep
Gazing at the starlit horizon
And the moonsparkling sea
When dawn comes he must leave them
His home, his children and loved
For his destiny beyond those waves
Known only to the Norns

He's already dressed ready to leave
His four friends are waiting by the shore
Each with a dragon ship
And one hundred men prepared for war

He returns to his bed kissing
His sleeping wife goodbye
And as he leaves his youngest son
A tear rolls from his eye

They set sail with the first morning rays
Heading for glorious wars
And as the five ships steer out from the bay
Their hearts pound like never before

The wind is strong, the sun is warm
Their Dragons fly across the waves
No greenfaces are seen here onboard
Only a crowd of braves

Many nights pass
And days long as a year
They await the battle
They await without fear

On the morning of the fifth day
Before the sun arose
They hear bells chime and see pyres
Torched at a nearby coast

"LOWER THE SAIL, GRAB YOUR OARS,
NOW MEN IT'S TIME TO ACT!
ROW LIKE THE WIND TO THE SHORE,
ROW LIKE THE WIND TO ATTACK!"


3. Without Fear


I see
Without fear my destiny
As the raging skies begins to fade
Pouring rain
Licks my wounds as my blood flows
From my torn flesh!

As I die
I hold my sword
My only friend
And pray that Oden
Will take me home

The battle rages
But I hear only raindrops falling
Like in slow motion to the ground

Death release me
Free me from my earthly pain
Oden I ask thee please
Take me home

Without fear I die!

As I look
To the sky the heaven is lit
And Valkyries in shining armour
Descend

I rest my head
On the ground
And close my eyes
I know that Oden's sent for me
As I die

Without fear I die
I hold my sword
And die
Without fear


4. Victorious March


Ten heavy feet
Walk the bloodsoiled ground
With rhythm these
Five warriors march

No matter how much
The bleeding wounds
From enemy swordcuts
Hurt to the bone

The revenge they sought
Was taken in blood
No mercy was showed
No mercy was showed

They ignore the pain
That hammerlike pounds
From falls, off slain horses,
To the ground

No signs of weakness
No signs of weariness
Not even a glimpse
Of remorse in their eyes

They slew men ruthless
Fed the wolves with flesh
And now they leave
This land side by side

Now they're headed home
Five swordsmen who fought repentlessly
Their story will be told
Of five brave men endlessly

All sorrow is left
For the women to bare
The children cries
They live in fear

No man was spared
No house or farm remains
No christian woman unraped
Their church consumed by flames

Their steel shines red
With enemy blood
It sings of victory
Granted by the Gods
And as they return
Bleeding but proud
The horizon burns
And the song is ringing loud


5. Friends Of The Suncross


Salt water licks my face
and wind fills the sail
We head for wars on distant shores

My friends are all with me
And so they'll always be
We'll never bend untill the end

We cross the open waves
On course to far off lands
Thor guides our ships
With his strong hands

Across the waves our seasnakes fly
Carried like ravens in the sky
By heavens breath on wings of death

Blood will run red
As we sever bodies from their heads
We maim and kill by pure will

We hail our Gods
Sacrifice in blood
Our altar is the battlefields

Death is something we don't fear
Though it's always near
Ygg brings us home when time has come

We are five of us
Friends of the suncross
Strong and brave to the grave!


6. Abandoned


They came riding down the slopes
Five fearless men prepared to fight
We heard with fear the rumbling earth
In the mid-day light

Surprised we saw all terrified
The brave northmen's run
The fearless five with power ride
Attacking us in the mid-day sun

Their charge was fast, no alarm was sound
They broke right through our lines
I felt the cut it threw me to the ground
And now I feel has come my time

I lie here in my blood
And see my family get killed
I feel abandoned by my god
I fear death's chill

I see Hel's gates
Towering high
And dark are they
I don't want to die

Oh no! I was wrong
Denied the true gods
And now I'm doomed
I trusted foreign men
And their god's son
But now when I need them
They are gone

I see Hel's gates
Towering high
And dark are they
I die!

They ride across the planes
And punish those of false belief
All resistance is in vain
As they caress them with cold steel

They are the punishers
And they will never bend
They are power the five of them
From Asgard they are sent

The power they have in all they do
The Christians non will feel
No one can escape them no
They will make them kneel

Their fight is through, they must return
No one here survived
And as the blood red sky begins to burn
To Valhall they will ride


7. Amon Amarth


A storm rolls in from the sea
Covering the land with black thunder clouds
Rain whips the ground at their feet
As they come ashore in this foreign land

Thunder brakes the silence
Of fivehundred men assembled ashore
Gazing through the misty rain
At the mountain not a mile away
So dark and silent it stands there
The mighty AMON AMARTH
Reaching for the cloudcloked skies
So grim and fearful in might

With the wind in their backs they start walking
Decisive men of the north
They strive through this darkened land
With only mount doom in their sight
The closer they get to the mountain
The clearer their eyes can see
A forest of one thousand spears awaiting
Awaiting the battle that will be

A cry of war emerges
Echoes over the field
Warriors run, like wolves up the sloaps
Boldley charging the enemy lines

With weapons so fearsome and sharp in their hands
And shields of oakwood and steel
They slit open stomachs and split skulls to the jaw
Intestants cover the field

The defenders are weak in this brutal war
The northmen have power and guts
A bloodshed like no one has seen here before
None can escape their cuts

Arrows with fire fly through the air
Touching houses and shields
The Vikings can feel victory is near
As the enemy headlessly flees

A gust of wind blows in from the north
Clearing the clouds away
As twilight falls and the stars come forth
And the seawolves return to the bay

Corpses lie scattered all over the field
For the ravens to eat as they please
The mountain is now left there behind
As they sail with the first morning breeze


8. Once Sent From The Golden Hall


Rumbling thunder cracks the sky
And rain starts pouring down
Lightning strikes a cold bright light
Upon the blooddrenched ground

The sword play is hard
And many fall
Steel bites sharp in flesh
And upon a mountain
Towering tall
Stand the messengers of death

Five horsemen in armour bright
Waiting in the flashing light
Looking down upon the field
Where Vikings fight with axe and shield

On stallions black as night
With eyes burning red
They ride with thunder to the fight
Deliverance of certain death

A warcry loud as Heimdall's horne
Echoes across the land
Enemies who hear it freeze to the bone
Friends of doom proudly stand

They ride faster than the wind
With lightning speed they strike
Black ravens follow where they've been
To feed from those who died

With power they wield their swords
As they ride down fleeing men
Sending them to Hel's dark court
To never come back again

The warriors ride once more
To the mountain from which they came
Once sent by the gods to war
And they never return in shame(Balder) Nightmares
Demons haunt my taunted mind
I'm scared
My death's forseen ungloryful
Plase Father
Make my demons disappear
Please Mother
Death is everywhere

(Odin) My son I've seen your fear
I have felt your pain
No harm will come to you
An oath has been sworn

(Balder) The evil forces around us
Still wants to destroy me
Who is the evil slayer
I cannot see

Loke the deceitful God
Discover the arrow of death

Pointed for the Hoder the blind
by the jealous Loke
The arrow cut through the skin
And into the heart of the bright one

Silence spread throughout the hall Aesir
As the God of Light fe to his knees dying!

Sorrow throughout the nine worlds
The bright God is gone
Sent to Nifelheim by the deceitful...


2. The Arrival Of The Fimbul Winter


The bleak fimbul winter arrived
Raging across the world
With a fury that defied the memory of man
Terrible wars where fought,
the like had never been seen
Men slew without a thought
The ties of kinship were no more

Skoll and Hati, the ravenous wolves
Arose and devoured the sun and the moon
Darkness descended upon the earth
And the stars fell from the skies
Loud blows heimdall the horne's in the air
Odin quests the head of Mim
Now shakes the holy ash where it stands
The ancient tree moans, Fenris breaks free

How are the Aesir?
How are the Alves?
Loud sounds Joutunheim
Aesir comprise
By the stonedoors dwarfs are moaning
The mountains wise men
Know you now or not?

With his shield at hand
Hrym travels from the east
The serpant is turning, enormous in rage

The serpant breaks the waves
The eagle screams
Nidhoggs tearing corpses
Free comes Nagelfar

Loke leads the legions of the dead
In holy war
Against the justice made by Aesir


3. Burning Creation


Surtur comes from the south
With red hot fire wargods swords
shines like the sun
Mountains breaks, men on hel-road
The heaven crumbles, Ragnarok is at hand

Then to Hlin appears
Another grief when Odin goes to fight
The evil Fenris
And the brave and glory Frey
goes against Surtur
Then will Friggs beloved one die
Vidar,Odin's mighty son,
he will come to slay the wolf
The sword runs into the
heart of Hverdrungs son
So he avenges his father

So comes Llodyns noble son
Thor he goes to fight the snake
In anger he slays the guardian of Midgaard
Nine steps dying walks Odin's son
Away from the snake who misdeeds not fear
Dying from it venom

When all are gone
Only Surtur remained
Passing his hand of fire
across the whole world
Consuming all of creation


4. The Mighty Doors Of The Speargod's Hall


[Music/Lyrics: Amon Amarth]

A battle on a distant shore
Seawolves' wrath sweeps the land
Down from the sky Valkyries ride
And walk the field, hallowed by Tyr

The fight is hard, axes swung
Swords bite sharp, men are slain
The ground turns red, blood-soaked field
Dead man's last bed and Oden sees

Vikings fall, in blood they lie
The web of Horns
They've met their fate
With shield and sword
They're brought in pride
To mighty doors of the Speargod's hall

The gates open and into the hall of braves
They silently walk
The one-eyed sits in glory might
Raises his cup and says:

"Pl vida faltet
Harman svingat
Det blankat svardet
Oeh banen mott
Till den hoges sal
De i ara forts
Oeh vid mjodet hor
Oden kvada"

Dawn breaks. The Einherjer goes to
Relive their last fight
With passion, swords held high
As they ride in the morning mist

The sun warms the air
War cries sound
"Tor Hjelpe!"
The battle begins

Charging horses with fire in breath
Rush to battle - in glory die!

Swords sing in joy
Again they cut
With shining edges
Blood-stained steel

Axes shine, again they're swung
Ripping flesh - death be done

The cold night comes
With charging darkness
To Oden's hall
The Einherjer return

A feast awaits until the next day
When warriors' eyes again shall burn


5. Under The Grayclouded Winter Sky


[Music/Lyrics: Amon Amarth]

Grey clouds - cover the winter sky
Cold snow - falls like autumn leaves to the ground

The icy wind
Pierces the skin of waiting warriors
Like spears
Will pierce their bodies in battle

Frosted
Beards on pale grey faces
Eyes of death
Are burning with rage

Glancing across the fields of Tyr
In the early morning light

Grey clouds - cover the winter sky
Cold snow - falls like autumn leaves to the ground

The icy wind
Pierces the skin of waiting warriors
Like spears
Will pierce their bodies in battle

War cries break the silent wait
Charging warriors rush to kill
Swords are swung in the air
The gods of war are called

Vikings with fire in soul
Clash on the open field
Slaying with powerful strokes
The snow is turning red

Hooves gallop the plains
Warlords on horsebacks
Ride into battle
With a thunderous roar

The storm wind of death
Blows across the field
Sweeping with it
Everything in its way

So the battle settles
Alone stands just one man
Under the grey-clouded winter sky - alone. . .War, the very first war of our world,
When the treacherous witch was killed
Three times burned and three times born,
By searing flames was Gullveig torn.

Death, Odin hurled his spear off with great force
Deep into the great vana-fyrd
battle horns gave up their sound
And Asgard walls razed to the ground.

The Vanir felt deceived
Hœnir was a fool
without Mímir at his side
Hœnir could not rule
In a fit of violent rage
Mímir's blood was shed
and to Odin's court they sent Mímir's severed head

Truce, so a brittle and frail peace was forged
And to ensure that the peace remained.
Njordr and Freyr to Asgard came
and Hön' and Mim to Vanaheim

Death, see the furious gods wanting blood,
Odin knew that a raging war
would not bring them any gain
Just leave a black and bitter stain.

Odin tog huvudet och
smorde det med örter
som hindrar det
från att ruttna
han kvad sedan
trollsånger över det
så att Mimer åter
kunde tala till honom

[English translation:]
Odin took the head, and anointed it with herbs
which prevents it from rotting
he sang his magic songs over it
so that Mimer be able to speak to him

The Vanir felt deceived
Hœnir was a fool
without Mímir at his side
Hœnir could not rule
In a fit of violent rage
Mímir's blood was shed
and to Odin's court they sent Mímir's severed head


2. Töck's Taunt - Loke's Treachery Part II


You come to me, eyes full of grief
you ask of me to shed all my tears
to let him return from kingdom of fears
Why should I weep? or lose any sleep?
He never brought me pleasure or glee
so why would I help to set Balder free

You come to me,eyes full of grief
all of your tears mean nothing to me
so why will you not just leave me to be
am I to blame? Well, I'm not ashamed!
Oh how I smiled when I heard the tale
Of Loke the sly, so clever and brave

Höder the fool,Lopt's willing tool
he held the twig that cut Balder's skin
Lopt aimed the shot
that killed Höder's twin
leave me alone
don't come here and moan
I've never wished to see Balder's well
so let his soul remain down in hel

My name is Töck and I won't cry
I won't let Balder return
Let hel keep her treasured prize
let his soul forever burn

You come to me and cannot believe
that this old crow now talking to you
is Loke not Töck you bloody dawn fools
you come to me and you do not see
all of your tears mean nothing to me
why will you not just leave me to be

[solo: Mikkonen]

My name is Töck,and I won't cry
I won't let Balder return
Let hel keep her treasured prize
let his soul forever burn


3. Destroyer Of The Universe


I rise up from muspelheim
My fury is sublime
The sword I bring burns violently
With wild and lethal flames

I march against the asagods
To bring the end of time
I am pure and endless pain
And Surtur is my name

See me rise, the mighty Surt
Destroyer of the universe
Bringer of flames and endless hurt
Scorcher of men and earth

[Solo: Södenberg]

Swordless frej with horn in hand
Rises to his final stand
He doesn't stand a single chance
I'll split his living corpse in half

And yet he stabbed me in the eye
He drove the horn in deep
The overwhelming, raging pain
Is driving me insane

The waves of flames that
I've unleashed will eat us all alive
The rage that burns within my heart
Is uncontrolled and wild
And now everything shall die!
Massive waves consume us all, the ocean is released
Our dying world quakes underneath
And sinks into the sea
And now nothing will survive!
Extinction waits for everyone
For gods and men alike
When all are gone of the old world
A new one will arise

[Solo: Södenberg]

See me rise, the mighty Surt
Destroyer of the universe
Bringer of flames and endless hurt
Scorcher of men and earth

See me die, the mighty Surt
Destroyer of the universe
Drowning in waves that floods the earth
The beginning, of a new rebirth


4. Slaves Of Fear


They speak of love and tolerance
They thrive on people's ignorance
To make you all slaves of fear

They feed on your anxiety
To build their dead society
They've kept you down for a thousand years

They nurture prejudice and hate
Condemn the wars that they create
In the name of whatever god

They gladly sacrifice your lives
Increasing power is their prize
Without regrets they'll spill your blood

They're feeding you lies
With calculating smiles
Enslavement of the human mind
As long as you kneel to their authority
Religion is what makes you blind

They're treating you as mindless fools
And use you as obedient tools
It's time to set your spirit free

This world we cannot tolerate
It's time to seal all preachers' fate
And let them hang from Oden's tree

Your minds are restrained
Obedience is the chain
They've locked you up and thrown away the key
Your souls are for sale,
And you're the ones who pay
But still you'll never be set free

They're feeding you lies
With calculating smiles
Enslavement of the human mind
As long as you kneel to their authority
Religion is what makes you blind


5. Live Without Regrets


From birth we're taught how to survive
We're taught how war is waged
And there are no men now alive
Who stops our wild rampage

Light at heart we bide our bane
whatever death awaits!
Norsemen live without regrets
We accept our woven fates

So fearlessly we charge ahead
There is no time to hesitate

Don't despair, show no fear
Live your life without regrets
Don't despair and show no fear
In the face of a certain death

A coward thinks he'll always live
If it keeps himself from strife
Old age leaves no rest and peace
though spears may spare his life

We don't mourn a friend that fell
or dread the day we'll fall ourselves
Warriors don't go to Hel
'cause we know Ygg will greet us well!

Fearlessly we charge ahead
There is no time to hesitate

Don't despair, show no fear
Live your life without regrets
Don't despair and show no fear
In the face of a certain death

So raise your horns to those who died
Let's drink to fallen friends tonight
Let's celebrate their glory life
We'll meet again in Valhall when we die
When we die!
When we die!


6. The Last Stand Of Frej


See him rise, from land of flames
our destruction is at hand.
It is time to make stand
now I face, and awesome foe
I will always stand my ground
To this end my fate is bound!

This fight is mine and mine alone
and there's no help from anyone!

His wrath burns!
With insane heat
all his fury is unleashed
there is no way to defeat!
The forces and the power that he wields

My hand holds the horn so firm
I am calm and ready to die
Everything around me burns
And I know that I will not survive

See him rise from land of flames
in this wild and barren land
I will make my final stand
My death awaits, I have no fear
To this end my fate is bound
though I'm doomed
I'll stand my ground!

This fight is mine and mine alone
and there's no help from anyone!

[Solo: Simon Solomon]

I go forth to meet my doom
but I will die in vain
perdition waits for everyone
The world will die in flames

With all my strength I run the horn
deep into his eye
And as he swings his burning sword
I die with a tired smile!

[Solo: Simon Solomon]


7. For Victory Or Death


Time!
has come to wash our shame away
to erase the image of defeat
We!
have licked our wounds,restored our strength
and our vengeance will be oh so sweet

They thought they had us down
that we'd never rise again
they will learn that they were deadly wrong
what's owed will be repaid

Again we'll feed the wolves
and then vengeance will be ours
we'll split their skulls and spill their guts
upon the frozen ground
Yeah,we'll never kneel again
not to deity nor men
now they'll taste our bitter hate
what's owed will be repaid

So raise the flag once more
and the eagle will be fed
once again we march to war
for victory or death

They arrived with talk of hvitekrist
by force they wanted us to kneel
with their swords held to our throats they preached
but we will make them pay we'll take their lives away

[solo: Mikkonen]

So Raise!
raise the flag once more
in the east the eagle will be fed
March!
again we march to war
we will march for victory or death
Pain!
the pain and suffering
is but a bleak and distant fading dream
Shame!
our disgrace; a withering thought
finally our names will be redeemed


8. Wrath Of The Norsemen


My head hurts like hell
Can't open my eyes
My clothes are all wet
And I'm freezing right through
Don't know where I am
Or how to get home
My arms they're so numb
And it's hard to get up

My muscles they ache
With every move
I stand on my feet
But my knees feel so weak

[Chorus:]
Somebody wake me
From this horrible dream
Somebody save me
From this terror I feel

[Solo: Söderberg]

I stumble around
on the soft muddy ground
I call out the name
of the friends I can't find
but only the wind
And the ravens reply

With every gasp
with every breath
smoke fills my lungs
and my intestines wrench
With every gasp
the sweet taste of death
The air is full of a thick
pungent stench

[Solo: Söderberg]

So comes then rain
it's colder than ice
I wash off my face
and open my eyes
And then I see
but wish I were blind

They are all dead
there's blood everywhere
The Norsemen they left
only death and despair
A stench of flesh
that fills the Autumn air

[Chorus:]
Somebody wake me
From this horrible dream
Somebody save me
From this terror and pain
No one can save me
From this horrible dream
No one can hear me
Or my heart-wrenching screams


9. A Beast Am I


Conceived was I
From chaos and hate
Of malice, deceit and blood
And how would they know
My fate is to rise
Against the Asagods
My being is full, full of a rage
An evil that can't be tamed
It darkens my soul
And blackens the blood
A fire that fills my veins

So how
Did I ever end up here?
Humiliated, broken and weak
I've waited
For a thousand years
To break these chains apart and
To finally break myself free

I bit the hand, off the mighty Tyr
When I couldn't, tare my ties
Now banished I dwell
A sword in my jaw
awaiting the end of time
In darkness I drown
Consumed by my hate
Longing for revenge
Allfather will pay
For his deceit
At the battle
Of Ragnarök

A beast am I
So vicious and grim
They fear my mean
Grinning teeth
I bide my time
my sweet revenge
Soon my ties will fall
And finally I will be free

So when you hear me howling
You'll know that I have come for you
When you hear me call your name
Your life will end in nameless pain

[Solo: Simon Solomon]

Conceived was I
From chaos and hate
Of malice, deceit and blood
And how would they know
My fate is to rise
Against the Asagods
My being is full, full of a rage
An evil that can't be tamed
It darkens my soul
And blackens the blood
A fire that fills my veins

A beast am I
So vicious and grim
They fear my mean
Grinning teeth
I bide my time
my sweet revenge
Soon my ties will fall
And finally I will be!
Finally break myself!
Finally I will be free!


10. Doom Over Dead Man


The autumn clouds are caving in
And night comes crawling, black as sin
Lightning strikes, and rain begins
A storm that tears my soul

I toss and tumble in my bed
My thoughts are spinning in my head
Darkness nears, soon I'll be dead
I'm losing all control

I've spent my life in foolish quests
for gold and riches, I confess
And now I'm left with just regrets
Too late to change my ways

My life, it seems, has slipped away
I leave no legacy to praise
Nothing more for me to say
My life has been a waste

When!
My time has come for me to leave
When!
When judgment's passed upon my life
When!
A cold dark grave will wait for me
Will!
Will my name live endlessly?
When!
My time has come for me to leave
When!
When judgment's passed upon my life
When!
A cold dark grave will wait for me
Will!
Will my name live endlessly?

So I die
But won't be mourned
Broken and alone
I wish that I were never born

So I die and won't be missed
No rune stone will be raised
As my body rots away

Die!
All friends and cattle pass away
Die!
And death will come for every man
Die!
But I know one thing never dies
Doom!
The sentence passed upon the dead
Now!
The time has come for me to leave
Now!
When judgement's passed up on my life
Now!
Now I will rest in my dark grave
Will!
They speak my name with reverence?

My life has been a waste
No rune stone will be raised
So I die, but won't be mourned
I wish that I were never born
I rest here in my shallow grave
As my body rots away
Making way through blades and spears
We attack at dawn
The glory scene is near
From northern gods we're spawned

Defender's fighting spirit crack
Torching house of single god
We leave land burnt black
And bodies floating in blood

War to us is holy
We sacrifice our blood
War to us is holy
We bleed for ancient Gods

Blasting forth with rage in our war eyes
We burn with hate
Cut our way through hordes of weak Christian flesh
Cast them into death
WAR!

War to us is holy
We sacrifice our blood
War to us is holy
We bleed for ancient Gods

Burn away the false and untrue ones
We make them kneel
To the only true and powerful Gods
And then we kill
WAR!


2. The Last With Pagan Blood


We storm ahead with swords and shields
For victory we ride
We fight the world on these battlefields
To re-erect the pagan pride

We draw the blood of those in our way
It's 'victory or die
With pounding, raging fury we slay
The Christian hounds will pay

Charge ahead, no retreat
No mercy, none shall live
To us there is no defeat
No remorse to give

A wind of power blows from the north
The enemy shivers to the core
We slay with strength, pushing forth
Silence before the storm

The gates of Valhalla open up
The ground beneath us shakes
As Odin leads the Gods to war
The Rainbow Bridge cracks

Nothing can stop this final attack
We carve up all in our path
Now there is no turning back
Final battle is here at last

A feast awaits us when we return
Awaiting all that fought in wrath
By the long fires we sit in glory
And beer will cool our soar throats

We are few but strong in will
The last with pagan blood
We fought the world with burning steel
Now we sit in Hall of Gods

Pride and glory in our hearts
Pride and glory in our hearts


3. North Sea Storm


Above my heads mighty men battle
Flashing blades rip through the air
Cracking shields with rumbling thunder
Rolling over the waves

Blood pours like rain onto the sea
As it wind-whipped foams
Warlords in shining helmets
Send men screaming to their death

Clouds of black cover the sea
Day turns into night
Infinite darkness beckons me
No more sun, no more light

Ships tied stern to stern
A battle on the north sea waves
Hearts of braves brightly burn
Berserks swing their metal-blades

Battle hammers hit with force
Crushing helmet covers heads
Dying men tumble over board
Foaming waves colored red

Memories invade my mind
As my harness brings me down

My body's getting cold and numb
As the ocean pulls me down

Above my head my brave friends battle
Their flashing blades rip through the air
Sending men screaming to join me
As I die in these cold north sea waves


4. Avenger


My pale face face glows in the light of fire
My hollow eyes see but cannot see
I stare deep into the glowing inferno
The loss I feel is breaking me

I heard their screams
Through flaming walls
Walls, I could not tear down
I could not help them

I'd been away for two full years
Only to return too late to save them
Helplessly I watched my life go up in flames

I pull the sword from the glowing fire
And hammer-beat in on the anvil
Forging it with rage and hate
I will seal my enemy's fate

I engrave the blade with magic runes
And summon Gods by sacrifice in blood
Pure blue hate shines within this sword
This magic sword will cut only once

No sword has ever been like this one
The Avenger is its name

Now my sworn enemy
Vengeance will belong to me
A year has gone by
Now my sworn enemy
It's your turn to die
It's your turn to die!
Die!
To die!
Die, die!
Die, die!
Die, die, die, die, die!

The sword cuts through his throat
His head tumbles to the ground
The headless body lays gently down
Down to sleep in a pool of blood

The Avenger has lost its shine
The magic is now drained
Dull and useless it rests in my hand
Its purpose is soon fulfilled

Now hate is gone but emptiness remains
So I turn the blade around
And run it through my stomach veins
And I fall to the ground


5. God, His Son And Holy Whore


Serpent tongue speaks to me
Of a man from southern land
How ancient Gods are enemies
But I don't understand

Hippocritic voice of love talks of peace and Christ
Blasphemer of Gods above
One thousand years of lies

They hold their swords to out throats
And force-feed us with faith
'Bout god, his son and holy whore
But now we retaliate

Prophets of a false believe talk with tongue of ice
Threaten us with hell beneath
Now they all shall die

Turn the blade around, put the oppressors down

Free yourselves from the chains
Of lies that hold you down
Arise to be free again
We'll fight till we have won

Priests of hippocratic love talk of peace and Christ
Power is their only goal
Now they all shall die

Turn the blade around, put the oppressors down

Mess with us and you will feel
A pain so true yet so unreal

Yeah, use your hate, uncreate
Christian state will meet its fate

God, his son and holy whore
Now you will meet your fate


6. Metalwrath


Wrath, hate, pain and death
The code we live by
It's in our souls
Metal is the way

We fight the world
With glowing metal
Now the falses will pay

Our fight has just begun
We're sent from hall of gold
Messengers of death

We're coming after you
You can't escape us
We'll take away your breath

See us ride for vengeance
Friends of the sun cross
We are born of steel

See us ride down
The Amon Amarth
The last sight you'll ever see

So as you stand there
Under gray-clouded skies
Abandoned by your god
You know you're gonna die

You feel a sorrow
Surrounding you
As of the nine worlds
Screaming pain you feel
Your soul vaporizes
As your hearts burst

We charge without fear
Your time has come
Your Fimbul winter's arrived

A chilling wind of ice
Whirls through your heart
Pierces your bones and spine

We are all
Gazing to the skies
We'll make the false hammer fall
And we'll make Thor arise

Our quest is done
Your creation burns
Now we return to Odin's hall

Our dragon's fly
Across the waves
As twilight begins to fall

In victory we ride
We enter the mighty doors
Of the spear-god's hall

As Ygg salutes us
We raise our beers
And drink in honor of our cause

We are all
Greeted by the Gods
We made the false hammer fall
And Thor arose in blood


7. Legend Of A Banished Man


Run for your lives, death has arrived
Try save your soul, run from the sound of rowing oars

Out of the mist
Breaks a dragon ship
Even more feared
Than the nail-ship "Naglfar"

A bear-coated man stands in the bow
Cold-eyed he gazes towards the shoer
The dragon's head is grim and red
All covered with blood, a gift to the mighty Gods

Warshields are raised, the Gods are praised
The people stare paralyzed with fear

The legend tells of a man that fell
From grace of his baptised king
As a banished man he fled his land
But solemnly sworn to return with holy war

But no one knows how the legend goes
'Cause no ones survived
That's gazed into his eyes
'Cause no one's returned that's met his fire

They say wolf-skinned men follow him
Berserks whose eyes burn with flames of ice

Some say mighty Thor
Guides their blades in war
They say they cannot be killed
Nor can their blood be spilled

So run for your lives
Death has arrived
The legend has come
To take the lives of the deceitful ones

Run for your lives
The death ship's arrived
There's no way you'll live
To tell of meeting his fire
Bastards of a lying breed
You've ruled us for too long
Truth to you are lies to me
And your right is so wrong

Moral preached by immoral fucks
All I feel is despise
Lie no more you fucking cunts
You tare me up inside

Your sons die from your abuse
But you're giving us the blame
The easy path's the one you choose
That road will lead to pain
You're trying to control their mind
And strip them of free will
They way you force them to go blind
Will surely get them killed

My mind is free and so is my soul
You can't put me in chains
I won't play the well-adjusted role
Or bow my head in shame

So throw your stones of guilt at me
Point your finger, Curse my name!
Your scapegoat I will never be
I won't take the blame!

Now we're on trial to serve your crime
And pay for your mistakes
There is no way we'll do the time
The chains of lies will break
Censorship can't stop our truth
We speak straight from the heart
There is nothing you can do
We'll tare your souls apart

So see us rise we're few but strong
We'll crack your fucking teeth
And feed you with your twisted tongue
Until you cannot breathe

The fury makes our eyes see red
It burns within our hearts
Soon you'll all be stone cold dead
We'll tare your souls apart!


2. Masters Of War


STRIKE!
Fast and hard, show no mercy for these men
The vermin of Christ, prophets of lies and their disciples
Seek them out, hunt them down
Break their spirits, crush their hearts
Not even death will set them free from this pain

CHARGE!
Ride them down as they flee from our steel
Draw their blood, make them suffer
Before they die by war-field sacrifice
Wipe them out! Burn their homes and fields
Feed the wolves with their offspring, annihilate them all!

Masters of War, torment every soul
Rape every whore that carries the cross

FIRE!
Burn them all, burn them alive
Send their souls to Deathqueen's hall
To the land of cold burning flames
Send them to the land of famine and despair
Eternally they will starve and freeze


3. The Sound Of Eight Hooves


He's running through the woods so black
A loyal servant of Christ
Dogs are barking down his back
He's running for his life

He came with words of love and peace
These heathens had to be saved
He thought that he could make them see
Instead he was enslaved

In captivity he spoke of god
To all he met he preached
But when his master's patience ran out
He knew he had to flee

Tears are running down his cheeks
As he sobbign realizes
That in this land his god is weak
And today he's going to die

He stumbles out onto an open field
Where an old oak tree grows
In the branches hang men of three
Dressed in preacher robes

His knees refuse to carry him on
Terror shines in his eyes
His faith in Christ is almost gone
His god's left him to die
Below the dead he says his prayers
To the god he thought was alive
When he hears a calm voice say:
"SHUT HIM UP AND HANG HIM HIGH!"

As his breath leaves his eyes open wide
A bright light comes from above
He greets this light with a smile
And thinks: "There is a God"

The sound of eight hooves reaches his ears
Comes from the heavenly light
Two wolves' howls fill his heart with fear
And he sees two ravens fly
Down from the sky a warlord rides
Like fire his one eye glows
And just before the preacher dies
He knows his god is false


4. Risen From The Sea 2000


Risen from the sea
The beast of hell is here
He's come to rule the earth
Kneel and obey his power

A second beast rises
Rises from the earth
Followed by an army
An army of immortals
An army of the dead

Second beast breaks from the earth
Kneel and obey his power
Fire in the rocks
Fire from the sky
Kneel and obey

Kneel or die!!
Kneel or die!!

There is wisdom with him
Who hath understanding reckon
The number of the beast for it is
A number of a man its number
Is six hundred sixty six, 666

He's risen from the sea
The beasts of hell are here
Come to rule the world
And you will be in fire

So it is written, So it has been
The beast is here, to rule the world
So it is written, So it has been
The beast is here, to rule the world

So it is written, So it has been
The beast is here, to rule the world
So it is written, So it has been
The beast is here, to rule the world


5. As Long As The Raven Flies


Men will fight and men will die
Wars will be lost and won
That's how it's been and still will be
Long after I'm gone

Doubting not I give my blood
So I may enter hall up high
The sky belongs to Asagods
As long as the raven flies


6. A Fury Divine


Death is drawing near
I know it's true but I have no fear
I know I can't escape my:

FATE! Turns it's deadly wheel
Judgement day is closing in but still I cannot feel:

REMORSE! Is for the weak
I stand silent while they speak, their accusations are all:

LIES! Spread by preaching men
I'm on trial for being who I am
And praising the Gods of my native land

I will stand firm, I refuse to kneel
The fury in me is divine
My dark grave awaits, my fate is revealed
But I'm not afraid to die

Death! The day to die is here
The sun rides high on the northern sphere
And the executioner sharpens his:

Axe! Shines in the sun
I smile when they tie me down
And hear the sound of the falling blade
Death! Sweet death, relieve me from this world
Death! Sweet death, relieve me, relieve:

So death finally came to him
The pagan man could not be turned
He faced death with a grin
Now his head rests in the dust

The proud man stood firm, he refused to kneel
Then fury in him was divine
Now he is dead, his fate has been sealed
He's brought to Golden Hall up high


7. Annihilation Of Hammerfest


All is lost and foreign kings
Rule the northern realms
Hammerfest, the last outpost
Has fallen to unbearded men

Lords of the bloody cross
Deceived or murdered all of true faith
Now the temple of Thor, where Mjolner is kept
Is under siege

They fear the power of Mjolner
The hammer of Thor
And all their efforts to destroy it have failed

From deep within the frozen ground
Comes a rumbling sound
Ravens fly and wild wolves howl
Sending shivers down Christians' spines

As if from nowhere
Dark and grim he appears
The warlord of the Gods comes with force
To retrieve The Crusher

The first man died with a gurgling sigh
When his head was crushed
Painful surprise in his eyes
As his life was snuffed

With raw and brutal force
The warlord breaks the temple doors
The weak back off in fear
On the altar it lies, he lifts the hammer high
And before it he swears:

`Allvise Ygg, Maktige Harjafader
Guda av Asars och vaners att
Hor mina ord, nar som jag svar
Att om tusen vintrar ater ta var ratt?

While he speaks his prayer
Mjolner rests in the air
As if holding breath

Frozen by fear
They gathered stand and stare
And what they see is death

A laughing cry fill the shivering night
He lets the hammer strike
A bolt of lightning bright
Rips the darkened sky
Fire of doom - Ignite!


8. The Fall Through Ginnungagap


Once I was - Now I am no more
A burst of flames threw me into oblivion

The life I knew - Seems distant and unreal
A fading dream, a memory I can't recall

Am I real - I can no longer tell
A notion tells me I still exist

Infinite dark - Through this void I float
Resting, waiting for the day
When I will live again

Eons pass or maybe I just blinked
Deeper into this hell I sink

Falling through Ginnungagap
I'm pulled towards an unseen gate
I seem to hear my name being called
I float towards these cries of fate

Faster than - the speed of light
I am falling through universe

Stars flash by - Before my eyes
The time has come to return

Out of the dark - Into the light
Back into life I am cast

By my side - A demon army rides
We ride to reclaim that once we lost

Eons have passed, I'm back from the dead
Victory lies ahead


9. Releasing Surtur's Fire


He's riding down 'cross a field familiar but nothing is the same
This place he knew as Hammerfest
When the old Gods reigned
The army of demons rides
By his side with weapons drawn
Today is the day
When Ragnarok will be spawned

There lies the mountain where the temple once stood
Where eons ago he arose to spill their christian blood

Stuck in the rock is a golden ring
That yet no one's dared to touch
The legend has it it's where the Crusher once struck

He pulls the hammer from the mountain's grip
The sign for demons to attack
He's been called upon to arise and he won't spare a single life
No, Thor (won't) spare a single soul, nor let them get away alive
They strike down on the world with overwhelming force
All resistance is brutally crushed, crushed without remorse
Dark angels descend to join the bloodfight
The slaughter brings them on, see Odin's Valkyries ride

The battle of Midgard is almost won
And the thousand years of tyranny will be forever gone
Soon a new world will be born rising from the Sea
Where Asagods again shall reign and humans will be free

He rides once more upon the black mountain of doom
Holding firm the Crusher of giants' bones
He lets the hammer strike, now everything will burn
As Surtur's fire is released upon the world


10. Eyes Of Horror


[Bonus Track]
[originally by Possessed]

Every night I see through eyes
Of a different lunatic
And every night I fantasize
In trancial mesmeric

All alone inside my head
Within my padded cell
Ruled by thoughts of another mind
Controlled by unseen eyes

In my mind I see the sun
Plunge into the sea I listen to my
Tales now I'll tell you what I see
And so the corpses
And the thrill
My mind is warped
Nothing's real

Do I dream
Or is it true
The piercing scream
She never knew

Every night I see through eyes
Of a different lunatic
And every night I fantasize
The eyes of horror1. Twilight Of The Thunder God


[featuring Roope Latvalan]

There comes Fenris' twin
His jaws are open wide
The serpent rises from the waves

Jormungandr twists and turns
Mighty in his wrath
The eyes are full of primal hate

Thor! Odin's son
Protector of mankind
Ride to meet your fate
Your destiny awaits
Thor! Hlödyn's son
Protector of mankind
Ride to meet your fate
Ragnarök awaits

Vingtor rise to face
The snake with hammer high
At the edge of the world

Bolts of lightning fills the air
as Mjölnir does it's work
the dreadfull serpent roars in pain

Thor! Odin's son
Protector of mankind
Ride to meet your fate
Your destiny awaits
Thor! Hlödyn's son
Protector of mankind
Ride to meet your fate
Ragnarök awaits

Mighty Thor grips the snake
Firmly by its tongue
Lifts his hammer high to strike
Soon his work is done
Vingtor sends the giant snake
Bleeding to the depth
Twilight of the thundergod
Ragnarök awaits
Twilight of the thunder god
Twilight of the thunder god
Twilight of the thunder god
Twilight of the thunder god

Thor! Odin's son
Protector of mankind
Ride to meet your fate
Your destiny awaits
Thor! Hlödyn's son
Protector of mankind
Ride to meet your fate
Ragnarök awaits


2. Free Will Sacrifice


See them gathered on the plains now
See an army strong and vast
As long as one of us remains here
None of them will ever pass

Here they come so raise the shields high
Like wolves they show their teeth
None of us will ever yield now
To the scavengers beneath

We're outnumbered ten to one here
Still, I love the odds
We will sacrifice them one by one
Send them off to the gods

Soon we will be gone
A free will sacrifice
As free men we are born
And free we shall die

Here they come ten thousand strong
Charging up the hill
This day will be both hard and long
They move in for the kill

Hold the line don't let it break
Use your sword and spear
A glory death, for all awaits
All who knows no fear

Hordes of men they hit the shields
Like waves they break away
We face our woven destiny
And we don't fear the grave

Soon we will be gone
A free will sacrifice
As free men we are born
And free we shall die


3. Guardians Of Asgaard


Standing firm against all odds

4. Where Is Your God?


The enemy has come for you
Hear the pounding thunder hooves
There's no time to run or hide
Draw the weapon from your side

When they ride out
From morning mist
With sharp blades in mighty fists
One hundred warriors on horse
An awesome brutal force

You feel weak and scared
Fear has gripped your heart
You will soon be over run
You will soon be torn apart

Now, where is your god?
Does he hear your prayers?
Does he even care for you?
His silence speaks loud and clean

Raid is done!
See the country burn
All are gone!
Only misery remains
Raid is done!
The warriors return
All are gone!
All that's left is pain

The Vikings strike
So fast and hard
Those who run won't make it far
And those who chose to stand and fight
They have made the choice to die

The weapons tear through flesh and bone
Dying men that scream and moan
With severed limbs
To the hall of death

The battlefield is full of death
Feel the stench of rotting flesh
When the entire country burns
As the warriors return

And they came out
From morning mist
With sharp blades in mighty fists
They leave this land
All burned and scorn
Those alive will mourn

Now, where is your god?
Does he hear your prayers?
Does he even care for you?
His silence speaks loud and clean

Raid is done!
See the country burn
All are gone!
Only misery remains
Raid is done!
The warriors return
All are gone!
All that's left is pain
Raid is done
See the country burn,
Only misery remains
All are gone
Warriors return,
All that's left is pain
Where's your god?
Does he hear your prayers?
Does he even care?
Where's your god?
Does he hear your prayers?
A silence loud and clear!


5. Varyags Of Miklagaard


Miklagaard has been our home
For twenty years or more
We've lent our axes, spears and swords
In service of the emperor

We are loyal warriors
That's the oath we gave
To protect the emperor
Even to a violent grave

Our loyalty was always firm
We kept our given word
On these southern battlefields
Our northern war cries roared

Battles have been fought
Many gave their lives
But all who died by axe and sword
Were called to hall up high

Our time here
Is now at end
Can't help but reminisce
A cold spring day
So long ago
When we set out to sea

We!
Set out from Svitjod's
Shores!
With dreams of fame and
Gold!
And!
The work of weaving
Norn's!
Was for us unknown

We were loyal warriors
That's the oath we gave
To protect the emperor
Even to the grave

It's time to take farewell
We have been resolved
From the sacred oath we gave
It's time to go back home

Out time here
Is now at end
Our memories will stay
Of Miklagaard
Our southern home
Until the end of days

We!
Set out for Svitjod's
Shores!
With honor and
Rewards!
We return back
Home!
We return back
Home!
With honor and
Rewards!
We return back
Home!


6. Tattered Banners And Bloody Flags


There comes Lopt, the treacherous
Lusting for revenge
He leads the legions of the dead
Towards the Aesir's realm

They march in full battle dress
With faces grim and pale
Tattered banners and bloody flags
Rusty spears and blades

Cries ring out, loud and harsh
From cracked and broken horns
Long forgotten battle cries
In strange and foreign tongues

Spear and sword clash rhythmically
Against the broken shields they beat
They bring their hate and anarchy
Onto Vigrid's battlefield

There comes Lopt, the treacherous
He stands against the gods
His army grim and ravenous
Lusting for their blood

Nowhere is longer safe
The earth moves under our feet
The great world tree Yggdrasil
Trembles to its roots

Sons of Muspel gird the field
Behind them Midgaard burns
Hrym's horde march from Nifelheim
And the Fenris wolf returns

Heimdal grips the Giallarhorn
He sounds that dreaded note
Oden rides to quest the Norns
But their web is torn
The Aesir rides out to war
With armor shining bright
Followed by the Einherjer
See Valkyries ride

Nowhere is longer safe
The earth moves under our feet
The great world tree Yggdrasil
Trembles to its roots

Sons of Muspel gird the field
Behind them Midgaard burns
Hrym's horde march from Nifelheim
And the Fenris wolf returns


7. No Fear For The Setting Sun


I'm out of breath
And all my muscles ache
It feels like spikes
With every step I take

My heart beats
It's about to burst
This day my luck
Turned to the worse

There's nowhere to run
Darkness is closing in
I don't fear the setting sun
Or the twilight that it brings
Dark clouds fill the sky
My fate is close at hand
Today is the day that I die
Today I make my final stand

I fought so hard
For taste of victory
The war is lost
But I refuse to kneel

I can't go back now
There is no retreat
I will fight hard for
All that I believe

I'm out of breath
And all my muscles ache
It feels like spikes
With every step I take

I can't go back now
There is no retreat
I will fight 'til death
I make my final charge

I, make my final charge
I; have no fear in heart
I will no longer run
I, do not fear the dark

There's nowhere to run
Darkness is closing in
I don't fear the setting sun
Or the twilight that it brings
Dark clouds fill the sky
My fate is close at hand
Today is the day that I die
Today I make my final stand


8. The Hero


The blade I swing
Is black as night
Black as my soulless heart
It bears the burden
Of many lives
But I don't feel remorse

I lent my sword
To anyone
Willing to pay the price
No regrets for
What I've done
A mercenary's life

But there i was
On battleground
Until I felt the jaws of death
Cut into my flesh
Defending old and weak
But I did not retreat

Now, here I lie
In my own blood
And strangers cry for me
I'm prepared to meet the gods
I wish they'd let me be

I don't deserve
Their sympathy
I know who I am
My soul is death and misery
I am an evil man

I rest in my blood
Soon I will face the gods
Strangers cry for me
I wish they'd let me be

Show no sympathy
Shed no tears for me
I know who I am
I am an evil man

I know who I am
I am an evil man


9. Live For The Kill


[featuring Apocalyptica]

The pack of wolves
Are closing in
Now, hear the howling beasts
They move fast
Through winter woods
And soon it's time to feast

A vicious hunt
On through the night
The prey is short of breath
They feel the sting
Of burning eyes
That's fixed upon their necks

A predator's heart
Knows no remorse
It lives for the hunt
A predator's heart
Knows no remorse
It lives for the hunt
A natural force

They show their sharp
And grinning teeth
As howls are getting higher
Sending chills
Down fleeing spines
Their blood runs hot as fire

The vicious chase
Is soon at end
They're hunted until death
They feel the pain
Of sharpening steel
That's cutting through their flesh

Fearless warriors
Feed the wolves
Now hear the howling beasts
They move fast
Through winter woods
See the grey-backs feast

A natural force
It knows no remorse
And lives for the kill


10. Embrace Of The Endless Ocean


I stroke the blade with my hand
the sharp edge cuts the skin
blood drips to the rain wet sand
my journey can begin

Once a slave but now I'm free
my honor is restored
once again I'll ride the seas
free at last from whip and oar

I slide the sword into the sheath
the ocean god is hailed
and as we push out to the sea
we raise the red striped sails

I've missed the breeze of my home shores
the frozen lakes and winter snow
but now my dreams start to unfold
father, I'm coming home

The storm came down without remorse
and water crashed the rails
the ship was thrown back and forth
as strong winds ripped the sails

The icy waves embrace my skin
I am going numb
The endless ocean swallows me
This will be my cold wet tomb

Won't feel the breeze of my home shore
nor see the lakes or winter snow
my hopeful dreams lie ripped and torn
father, I die aloneRising up to reek havoc on this land
A beast straight from hell with burning steel in hand
White heat, blinding lights as the molten lava flows
Total devastation as the power hammer blows

Burning anvil of steel
Cast by demons that dwell
Burning anvil of steel
Forged in the furnace of hell

Hammered down, a crushing force of weight
Razor sharp feel the metal penetrate
Grinding pain, the sparks that rip and blind
As Armageddon is brought upon mankind

Burning anvil of steel
Cast by demons that dwell
Burning anvil of steel
Forged in the furnace of hell

Burning!
Burning!
Burning anvil of steel!
Burning!
Burning!
Burning anvil of steel!

Burning anvil of steel
Cast by the demons that dwell
Burning anvil of steel
Forged in the furnace of hell


2. Satan Rising


In the deep and darkest forest
Night has reached its final hour
Pagans dance 'round brimstone fires
Lucifer comes to call

Evil rites are getting higher
Spinning fast hands to the sky
Unholy chants around the pyre
Heathens call, "Satan" they cry

Sacrificial rites
From the trees a blood-rain's falling
The end of all mankind
Satan stirs; he's heard their calling

From the underworld
Comes the beast arising
Demons gather to behold
From the shadows Satan's rising


3. Snake Eyes


Life is just a lottery
No matter how you choose
But that has never bothered me
'cause I was born to lose

It doesn't matter what the cost
You know I won't give in
And I don't care about the odds
Because I play to win

[Chorus:]
You know I am a gambling man
And I have paid the price
Luck has never graced my hand
When I roll the dice
Snake eyes!

I trust the way I live my life
The choices that I make
To the rolling of the dice
No matter what's at stake

Some will call me fatalist
And some will call me freak
But hidden in my throwing fist
The fortune that I seek

You know I am a gambling man
And I have paid the price
Luck has never graced my hand
When I roll the dice
Snake eyes!

I caught your eye in a New York bar
You were looking down at me
An angel in black measuring in
At just over seven feet

Some fellas like their women short
Some fellas like 'em round
But me I like the kind of girl
That makes me stand up to go down!

Stand up! To go down!
No man will throw her around
Stand up! To go down!
When we make out I can't reach the ground

We took a cab, you got in the back
But the front seat had to come out
The car shook, the car bounced
As you ground me pound for pound
But back at your place you took the reins
And saddled up, you rode me around
And just as I reached the finish line
You made me stand up to go down!

Stand up! To go down!
No man will throw her around
Stand up! To go down!
When we make out I can't reach the ground

Stand up! To go down!
I'm going down but I'm upward bound
Stand up! To go down!
In a crowd she's easily found
Stand up! To go down!
No man is gonna throw her around
Stand up! To go down!
When we make out I can't reach the ground
The wait is soon at end
Always charge, never bend
Morning is here, make your stand
Live for honor, glory, death in fire!

Total war is here
Face it without fear
Age of sword, age of spear
Fight for honor, glory, death in fire!

See the fire rise
Flames are raging high
Soon all will burn and die
Burn for honor, glory, death in fire!

Storm of lethal flames
Only death remains
Ragnarok is closing in
Die for honor, glory, death in fire!

Forces of chaos is on the move
Everyone, choose your side
And know the end is coming soon
The day for all to die

The day is here when Bifrost breaks
Nor sun or moon will rise
When the dead rise from their graves
And Surtur spreads his fire

All you know will wither away
And sink into the sea
A new world will be born one day
Where everyone is free

[Lead Söderberg]

Total war is here,
Face it without fear
Age of sword, age of spear
Fight for honor, glory, death in fire!

Storm of lethal flames
Only death remains
Ragnarok is our fate
Die for honor, die for glory
Die, death in fire!


2. For The Stabwounds In Our Backs


Silently we bide our time
Soon we'll pay you back
For all the wrongs you've done our kind
For the stabwounds in our backs

You think you're safe. Well, live your lie
There's no way you'll escape
The day that all things living die
The day we rise again

Then Fenris' father will summon us
And we will rise from the death
One million warriors with foaming mouths
To challenge life itself

A horrid ship of dead men's nails
Will bring our ranks ashore
The eastern wind will fill our sails
And your son will hold the oar

You think you're safe. Well, live your lie
There's no way you'll escape
The day that all things living die
The day we rise again

Our rusty swords will never rest
So send the best you've got
Into our grinning jaws of death
We'll make their suffering short

So sit there on your golden throne
Soon we will arise
Time for vengeance is coming soon
The time for all to die!


3. Where Silent Gods Stand Guard


The last head falls to the ground
No one is left alive
They thought that they could take me down
But it's not my time to die

I wipe the blood from my sword
And slide it in my belt
This is the sweetest of rewards
The best rush I have felt

Ten men are dead by my feet
I smell their streaming blood
And I smile, cause it makes me...
...makes me feel so good

They were crawling on their knees
Begging for their pathetic lives
Now their souls belong to me
As well as their eyes

Each man has something that I crave
I eat their steaming eyes
And drink their blood to make them my slaves
At Oden's feat in afterlife

I bring the skulls to my shrine
Where silent Gods stand guard
Soak them in blood and in wine - A sacrificial ritual

One thousand heads are on display
Collected through years of thirst
Macabre trophies from my prey
Picked clean of flesh by Oden's birds

I am - I am - A wolf in human shape
I am - I am - A predator with flaming rage

[Lead Mikkonen]

I'm a wolf in human shape - Every man is prey
A predator with flaming rage - Blood is in my trace

I will die with sword in hand
And then my seat's secured
When Oden calls from golden hall
He will greet me at the door


4. Vs The World


One we were scum of the Earth
Now we've cleared our names
In Nifelheim came rebirth
Baptized in Mount Doom's flames

A decade now we've fought this war
Never yielding from our path
Our journeys take us to foreign shores
Where we let our metal blast

We've been battered and left for dead
We've been beaten and we have bled
But we always made it through - Vs the world
This may be our last quest
Before we're put to rest
The end is coming soon - Vs the world

Warriors of the grave took us south
Hell bent on genocide
They made us face the brutal truth
This would be no easy ride

Grotesque creatures of the sky
Met with us on winter fields
Christian god cast aside - Massacre of hallowed eve

We've been battered and left for dead
We've been beaten and we have bled
But we always made it through - Vs the world
This may be our last quest
Before we're put to rest
The end is coming soon - Vs the world

Persian demons brought us south
On merciless campaign
We've raided the western shores
Always going against the grain

All these years we've fought to win
And sometimes almost died
I tell you now we won't give in
Without a vicious fight

We've been battered and left for dead
We've been beaten and we have bled
Versus the world


5. Across The Rainbow Bridge


My days are numbered: soon I have to leave
The Norns have stretched my living thread
The notion of my demise won't leave me be
Why cannot death just set me free!

I've lived a life or prosperity
But I'm not as young as I used to be
Down the road waits misery
Why cannot death just set me free!

Countless armies have I attacked
Not once have I backed down
And though I've spilled a lot of blood
I never once received a mortal wound

I've raided shores in many lands
I cannot count the men I've killed
So many friends died with sword in hand
But the warrior's death was never granted me

I dress myself in battle clothes
Alone I make the final ride
My sight is blurred, by whipping snow
I seek to end my life

I want to walk across the Rainbow Bridge
And see my fathers in the golden hall
They beckon me to join their feast
In my dreams I hear their call


6. Down The Slopes Of Death


Down the slopes of death he rides
The eight hooves pound like drums
Darkness reigns the crumbling sky
Invasion has begun

Fields of flames greets his eye
He smells the fear and pain
Of dying men in agony
It can drive a man insane

All enemies flee his spear
No bow nor axe do harm
Allfather rides out on fields of fear
When Heimdal sounds the alarm

But on the field waits his fate
Foretold in ancient times
A beast with sharp yellow teeth
And hateful burning yes

Today he'll draw his final breath
The wisest God of all
His son will avenge his death
Iormundr's brother will fall

He knows now what is to come
No use to try and run
What is to be, let it be done!
What is to be, let it be done!

Today he'll draw his final breath
The wisest God of all
His son will avenge his death
Iormundr's brother will fall

Down the slopes of death he rides
The eight hooves pound like drums
Darkness reigns the crumbling sky
Invasion has begun

Down the slopes of death he rides
The eight hooves pound like drums
Darkness reigns the crumbling sky
No more is the sun


7. Thousand Years Of Oppression


He hung on the windswept world tree
Whose roots no one knows
For nine whole days he hung there pierced
By Gugnir, his spear

Swimming in pain he peered into the depths
And cried out in agony
Reaching out he grasped the runes
Before falling back from the abyss

He gave himself unto himself
In a world of sheering pain
So that we all may live our lives
By the wisdom that he gained

You doubted him, and spread their lies
Across the world, with sword in hand
You raped our souls, and stole our right
All for the words of mild-mannered man

You listened to mild-mannered god
And put your faith in deceitful words
Your powertrip was paid by blood
In kindness' name you spilled our blood

I refuse to submit
To the god you say is kind
I know what's right, and it is time
It's time to fight, and free our minds

Let me die without fear!
As I have lived without it
So shut your mouth and spare my ears
I'm fed up with all your bullshit

After a thousand years of oppression
Let the berserks rise again
Let the world hear these words once more:
"Save us, oh lord, from the wrath of the Norseman"

Our spirits were forged in snow and ice
To bend like steel forged over fire
We were not made to bend like reed
Or turn the other cheek

He grasped the runes, they're ours to use


8. Bloodshed


Midgard's cold and hatred reigns
Hunger and disease
Fenris is set free again
Chaos is unleashed

The storm of death sweeps the shores
Famine sweep the land
Ties of kinship is no more
Sons die by their father's hand

Two men meet on battleground
Their eyes are full of hate
By sacred oaths both are bound
Death will be their fate

They share the blood of once proud men
Yet foes they have become
One fights for truth, the other for faith
Perish has begun

Here comes the - Bloodshed
It's the age of - Bloodshed
Here comes the - Bloodshed
It's the age of - Bloodshed

Two brothers meet in battle heat
Both will die to day
No victory and no defeat
Death is their only way

In their eyes is no remorse
They make their final charge
Thrusting their swords with mortal force
Piercing each other's hearts

[Lead Mikkonnen]

Here comes the - Bloodshed
It's the age of - Bloodshed
Here comes the - Bloodshed
Prepare for - Bloodshed


9. ...And Soon The World Will Cease To Be


The Northern wind brings snow and ice
Humans starve and freeze
The Fimbul winter has arrived
And soon the world will cease to be

Brother will be brother's bane
No one shall be spared
All will die. None remain
That is mankind's share

The southern sphere is set ablaze
Muspel's fire is set free
The sun is on its final chase
And soon the world will cease to be

Across the western sky he runs
A wolf so grim and mean
Devours the eternal sun
And soon the world will cease to be

The North Star falls from the sky
Into the deep cold sea
The first of all to fall and die
And soon the world will cease to be

Muspel's flames lick the sky
Hidhægg eats the dead
The Aesir meet in hall up high
And Oden 'quests Mimer's head

Land is swallowed by the waves
Rocks and mountains break
Dead men on the path to Hell
And Yggdrasil quakes

[Lead Mikkonnen]

From the East comes a ship
Loke holds the oar
A demon army with swords that rip
Will join the final war

The army of the dead arrives
Heimdal blows his horn
Calling Gods out to die
Before the world can be reborn


10. Siegreicher Marsch (Victorious March)


[Bonus track]

Zehn schwere Stiefel
ber Grund blutgetränkt
Im Gleichschritt marschieren
Diese fìnf Krieger

Es ist Ihnen gleich
Wie sehr Ihre Wunden
Von feindlichen Schwertern geschlagen
Bis auf die Knochen schmerzen

Die herbeigesehnte Rache
Begangen in Blut
Keine Gnade gezeigt
Keine Gnade gezeigt

Den Schmerz verleugnend
Der wie ein Hammer pocht
Erlitten durch Stìrze
Von erschlagenen Pferden

Kein Anschein von Schwäche
Noch Behutsamkeit
Nicht einmal ein Funke
Von Reue in Ihren Augen

Sie erschlugen die Männer
Nährten Wölfe mit Fleisch
Und jetzt verlassen Sie
Dieses Land Seite an Seite

Jetzt auf dem Heimweg
Fìnf Krieger die ohne Reue kämpften
Diese Geschichte von fìnf tapferen Männern
Wird ewiglich erzählt werden

Nur das Leid bleibt
Nur den Frauen allein
Die Kinder wehklagen
Von nun an lebend in Furcht

Kein Mann bleibt verschont
Kein Haus kein Hof verblieb
Keine Christin ungeschändet
Ihre Kirche von Flammen verzehrt

Rot scheint Ihr Stahl
Von Feindesblut
Erzählend vom Sieg
Der von den Göttern geschenkt

Als Sie wiederkehren
Blutend doch stolz
Brennt der Horizont
Und das Lied erklingt laut

[English translation:]

Ten heavy feet
Walks the bloodsoiled ground
With rhythm these
Five warriors march

No matter how much
The bleeding wounds
From enemy swordcuts
Hurts to the bone

The revenge they sought
Was taken in blood
No mercy was showed
No mercy was showed

They ignore the pain
That hammerlike pounds
From falls, off slain
Horses, to the ground

No signs of weakness
No signs of weariness
Not even a glimce
Of remorse in their eyes

They slew men ruthless
Fed the wolves with flesh
And now they leave
This land side by side

Now they're headed home
Five swordsmen who fought repentlessly
Their story will be told
Of five brave men endlessly

All sorrow is left
For the woman to bare
The children cries
They live in fear

No man was spread
No houses or farm remains
No christian woman unraped
Their church consumed by flames

Their steel shines red
With enemy blood
It sings of victory
Granted by the Gods
And as they return
Bleeding but proud
The horizon burns
And the song is ringing loudBlood gushes from the wound
The cut is wide and deep
And before I turn around
He falls to his knees

A clear song rings in the blade
When steel meets hardened steel.
I hear the sound of wood that breaks,
A swords cuts through my shield.

I drop the shield and grab my axe,
A weapon in each fist.
The first blow makes the helmet crack,
The axe cut to the teeth.

I rip the axe from the head,
covered in blood and brains.
Leave the body lying dead,
Ready to strike again.

My sword cuts through clothes and skin,
Like a hot knife cuts through snow.
I smile as the bastard screams,
when I twist my sword.

Sword in my hand,
Axe on my side.
Valhall awaits,
Soon I will die.
Sword in my hand,
Axe on my side.
Valhall awaits me,
When I die.
Bear skin on my back,
Wolf jaw on my head.
Valhall awaits me
When I'm dead.

I raise my axe above my head,
My eyes stare in furious rage.
Yet more blood will be shed,
This is a victorious day!

Blood gushes from the wound,
The cut is wide and deep.
As I turn around,
I fall to my knees.

Sword in my hand,
Axe on my side.
Valhall awaits,
Soon I will die.
Sword in my hand,
Axe on my side.
Valhall awaits me,
When I die.
Bear skin on my back,
Wolf jaw on my head.
Valhall awaits me
When I'm dead.


2. Runes To My Memory


We rode the rivers of the Eastern trail,
Deep in the land of the Rus'.
Following the wind in our sails,
And the rhythm of the oars.
No shelter in this hostile land,
Constantly on guard.
Ready to fight and defend
Our ship 'til the bitter end.

We came under attack,
I received a deadly wound.
A spear was forced into my back
Still I fought on.

When I am dead,
Lay me in a mound.
Raise a stone for all to see
Runes carved to my memory

Now here I lay on the river bank
A long, long way from home
Life is pouring out of me
Soon I will be gone.

I tilt my head to the side
And think of those back home
I see the river rushing by
Like blood runs from my wound.

Here I lie on wet sand,
I will not make it home.
I clinch my sword in my hand,
Say farewell to those I love.

When I am dead,
Lay me in a mound.
Place my weapons by my side
For the journey to Hall up high
When I am dead,
Lay me in a mound.
Raise a stone for all to see
Runes carved to my memory


3. Asator


Thunder rolls across the plains,
Thor rides in pouring rain.
He rides to Jotumheim to fight
Lightning strikes when Mjölner bites.

Fire! Burning in his eyes
Fire! His hate is pure, see the lightning strike
Fire! Burning in his eyes
Fire! His hate is pure, see the lightning strike

Lightning cracks the blackened sky,
Hear the thunder chariot ride
All brave men with hearts of war
Ride the path of mighty Thor

Son of thunder!
Lighting strikes
Son of thunder!
Son of thunder!
Thor Arise!
Son of thunder!

Son Of Oden
Thundergod
Master of War
Asator!

[Solo Söderberg]

Fire! Burning in his eyes
Fire! His hate is pure, see the lightning strike
Fire! Burning in his eyes
Fire! His hate is pure, see the lightning strike


4. Hermod's Ride To Hel - Lokes Treachery Part 1


[Hermod:]
Ride Sleipner
Ride for all you're worth
Faster then lightning,
To the dark realms of the world

Through valleys of darkness
On our way to Nifelheim
To the halls of Hel
Where my brother waits

Wailing voices on the wind
Urging me to turn
Distant tortured screams
Cold blue fires burn

I hear the sound of river Gjoll
Running cold and deep
It's a golden bridge shines in the dark
The bridge that Modgud keeps

Over the bridge, on through the night
Hel is getting near
There are the gates, towering high
Afflicting me with fear

In her hall, at the honor seat
My brother sits in pain
Pale and tortured Balder greats
Bound by invisible frozen chains

[Hermod:]
I have come, to bring him back with me
The whole world mourns his death!
Please set Balder free
Give him back his breath!

[Hel:]
If it's true, what you say to me
That the whole world mourns his death.
If the whole world will weep I'll give him back his breath!


5. Gods Of War Arise


Darkness flees the rising sun
The village lies ahead
It will wake to a new day soon
Soon they all be dead

We came in cover of moonless night
Fifty man at arms
Now at first morning light,
The church bell sound the alarm

Sacrifice to Gods of old
Bleed them of their lives
Fresh blood on our swords
Gods Of War Arise!

Sacrifice to Gods of old
Bleed them of their lives
Fresh blood on our swords
Gods Of War Arise!

Hear the tortured screams
Shattering the air
They awake the soothing dreams
Into their worst nightmare

Fire sweeps their homes
They feel the dragons breath
Consuming and destructive flames
Agonising death

Some seek shelter in the church
A refuge for those with faith
But we know how to smoke them out
A pyre will be raised

But those who choose to stand and fight
Will die with dignity
For the unfortunate few who survive
Waits a life in slavery

The day draws to an end
The night comes dark and cold
We return to our ships
With silver, slaves and gold

We gave them agony, as they fell and die
The gods have granted victory
For our sacrifice

The day draws to an end
The night comes dark and cold
We return to our ships
With silver, slaves and gold
We gave them agony
As they fell and die
The Gods have granted victory
For our sacrifice


6. With Oden On Our Side


Finally the storm arrives
Out wait is at an end
Under dark winter skies
We make our final stand

For each of us, there are four of them
It matters not to us
We won't leave this field in shame
We are here to crush!

[x2]
Futile to resist
You know why we have come
Futile to resist
The battle is already won!

Our hearts are full of pounding rage
Our mind hard as steel
Right before the dying day
We will have you kneel

The snow turns red from all the blood
Severed limbs and heads
A sacrifice to one-eyed God
He will claim the dead!

Under the winter skies
We stand glorious!
And with Oden on our side
We are victorious!

No retreat, no remorse
Victory will be ours
Blood on steel, sacrifice
Victory will be ours

Under the winter skies
We stand glorious!
And with Oden on our side
We are victorious!

[x2]
Futile to resist
You know why we have come
Futile to resist
The battle is already won!


7. Cry Of The Black Birds


Raise your swords up high!
See the black birds fly!
Let them hear your rage!
Show no fear!
Attack!

Charge your horses across the fields
Together we ride into destiny
Have no fear of death, when it's your time
Oden will bring us home when we die!

The ground trembles under us
As we make our thunder charge
The pounding hooves strikes blinding fear
Into their heart

Our helmets shine in the sun
As we near their wall of shields
Some of them turn and run
When they hear our frenzied screams

Draw your swords to strike
Hear the Black Birds cry!
Let them feel your hate!
Show no fear!

(Attack! Attack! Attack! Attack!)

Charge your horses across the fields
Together we ride into destiny
Have no fear of death, when it's your time
Oden will bring us home when we die!

The enemies are in disarray
Ride them down as they run
Send them to their violent graves,
Don't spare anyone
Dead and wounded lie all around,
See the pain in their eyes
Over the field an eerie sound,
As we hear the ravens' cry


8. Under The Northern Star


The icy winter is creeping near
Dark skies above us
Biting frost in the air
Darkness surrounds us

The cold piercing autumn breeze
Fills the longships sail
Soon the lakes and seas will freeze
And snow will lay its veil

Many years we've been away
Many oceans we have roamed
Now the North star guides us on our way
As we are heading home

The many hardships we've endured
Have brought us rich reward
Now the North star guides us home
With cargo full of gold

Many friends died on the way
Only few of us survived
But I would gladly take their place
In Odens hall up high

[Solo: Söderberg]

The icy winter is creeping near
Dark skies above us
Biting frost in the air
Darkness surrounds us

Soon the lakes and seas will freeze
And snow will lay its veil
And we will long for the summer breeze
Where we can set our sails


9. Prediction Of Warfare


Ships were prepared
Weapons and shields
Sails were raised
We headed out to sea!

Norway disappeared in the east
Our journey had begun
Helpful winds gave us our speed
Under a warming sun

Heading to the emerald land
A fleet of 50 ships
An army of two thousand men lead by the king

On the horizon dark clouds arose
Thor rode across the black clouds
As the night rolled in over us
We felt the wrath of the storm

That night I was haunted by dreams
An omen, of what was to come
The serpent arose from the sea

Ready to strike
With hammer in hand
The serpent in pain,
twisting in furious rage!
Fought for its life
The serpent escaped
Thor was in rage
My dreams began to fade

Woke from dreams
Sword in my hand
The break of dawn
We were closing in on Irish land
Time to attack
Grabbed our shields
We came ashore
And saw the waiting horde

The fight was short and deadly intense
The Irish fought us well
But as we gained the upperhand
Their fighting spirit quelled

Ready to strike
With swords in our hands
They struggle with heart
The Irish fell to our wrath
Fought for his life
Their king escaped
With fury divine
King Olaf threw his sword


10. Where Silent Gods Stand Guard (Live At Wacken)


[bonus disk track]

The last head falls to the ground
No one is left alive
They thought that they could take me down
But it's not my time to die
I wipe the blood from my sword
And slide it in my belt
This is the sweetest of rewards
The best rush I have felt
Ten men are dead by my feet
I smell their streaming blood
And I smile, cause it makes me...
...makes me feel so good
They were crawling on their knees
Begging for their pathetic lives
Now their souls belong to me
As well as their eyes
Each man has something that I crave
I eat their steaming eyes
And drink their blood to make them my slaves
At Oden's feat in afterlife
I bring the skulls to my shrine
Where silent Gods stand guard
Soak them in blood and in wine - A sacrificial ritual
One thousand heads are on display
Collected through years of thirst
Macabre trophies from my prey
Picked clean of flesh by Oden's birds
I am - I am - A wolf in human shape
I am - I am - A predator with flaming rage

[Lead Mikkonen]

I'm a wolf in human shape - Every man is prey
A predator with flaming rage - Blood is in my trace
I will die with sword in hand
And then my seat's secured
When Oden calls from golden hall
He will greet me at the door


11. Death In Fire (Live At Wacken)


[Bonus disk track]

The wait is soon at end
Always charge never bend
Morning is here, make your stand
Live for honor, glory, death in fire!
Total war is here
Face it without fear
Age of sword, age of spear
Fight for honor, glory, death in fire!
See the fire rise
Flames are raging high
Soon all will burn and die
Burn for honor, glory, death in fire!
Storm of lethal flames
Only death remains
Ragnarok is closing in
Die for honor, glory, death in fire!
Forces of chaos is on the move
Everyone, choose your side
And know the end is coming soon
The day for all to die
The day is here when Bifrost breaks
Nor sun or moon will rise
When the dead rise from their graves
and Surtur spreads his fire
All you know will wither away
And sink into the sea
A new world will be born one day
Where everyone is free

[Lead Söderberg]

Total war is here, face it without fear
Age of sword, age of spear
Fight for honor, glory, death in fire!
Storm of lethal flames
Only death remains - Ragnar?k is our fate
Die for honor, die for glory
Die, death in fire!


12. With Oden On Our Side (Demo)


[bonus disk track]

Finally the storm arrives
Out wait is at an end
Under dark winter skies
We make our final stand
For each of us, there are four of them
It matters not to us
We won't leave this field in shame
We are here to crush!

[x2]
Futile to resist
You know why we have come
Futile to resist
The battle is already won!

Our hearts are full of pounding rage
Our mind hard as steel
Right before the dying day
We will have you kneel
The snow turns red from all the blood
Severed limbs and heads
A sacrifice to one-eyed God
He will claim the dead!
Under the winter skies
We stand glorious!
And with Oden on our side
We are victorious!
No retreat, no remorse
Victory will be ours
Blood on steel, sacrifice
Victory will be ours
Under the winter skies
We stand glorious!
And with Oden on our side
We are victorious!

[x2]
Futile to resist
You know why we have come
Futile to resist
The battle is already won!


13. Hermod's Ride To Hel - Lokes Treachery Part 1 (Demo)


[bonus disk track]

thunder ride
make your time
ride for all you have
the enemy of mortal men
No time to loose
Eternal time above me
evil in the dark
as they ride to neiflheim
to bring their brother back
wailing voices haggle the wind
begging me to turn
distant tortured voices scream
cold blue fires burn
I hear the sound of river Gjoll
running cold and deep
its golden bridge burns in the dark
the bridge that Modgud keeps

over the bridge
on through the night
Hel is getting near
there are the gates towering high
I'm broken without fear
in her hall at the honor seat
my brother sits in gloom
pale and tortured baulder greets
bearing a face of doom
Oh!!!!!!

I have come to bring him back with me
the whole mourns his death
we beg of you
set baulder free
give him
back his breath

if its true
what you say to me
that the whole world mourns his death
then ill take in the whole worlds whim
I will give him back his breath


14. Once Sent From The Golden Hall (Sunlight Recording)


[bonus disk track]

Rumbling thunder cracks the sky
And rain starts pouring down
Lightning strikes a cold bright light
Upon the blooddrenched ground
The sword play is hard
And many fall
Steel bites sharp in flesh
And upon a mountain
Towering tall
Stand the messengers of death
Five horsemen in armour bright
Waiting in the flashing light
Looking down upon the field
Where Vikings fight with axe and shield
On stallions black as night
With eyes burning red
They ride with thunder to the fight
Deliverance of certain death
A warcry loud as Heimdall's horn
Echoes across the land
Enemies who hear it freeze to the bone
Friends of doom proudly stand
They ride faster than the wind
With lightning speed they strike
Black ravens follow where they've been
To feed from those who died
With power they wield their swords
As they ride down fleeing men
Sending them to Hel's dark court
To never come back again
The warriors ride once more
To the mountain from which they came
Once sent by the gods to war
And they never return in shame
1. Prelude
[instrumental]

2. Reach Out For The Light
[Gabriel]
Lord above - why don't you tell me
why I'm here in agony?
I've been serving, I've been praying
now I'm caught in misery.

I've been praised by friar Jakob,
I misused his confidence.
Cheated by this work of evil - 
feigning Anna's innocence.

Oh what have I done?
So many ways lead to the fallen one,
Lucifer, fallen light...
Oh what have I done?
What is going on?

We should bring salvation,
not give in to his temptation - no!
Read and preach the holy world
and no forbidden lies that hurt.
I remember words of "seven".
Set me bree - sanity!

[Lugaid]
Reach out for the light
far beyond confines.
You have read the magic lines
leading to the light in your mind...

[Gabriel]
What is right and what is wrong now?
Is it a trial of paradise?

Is anna a witch or do they stick to an error?
What's the book and the seal inside?

Am I a cleric or maybe a sinner? 
Unbeliever? Renegade?
Was it the devil who led me to "seven"?
Oh redeemer is it all too late?

Oh, what have I done?
I have been led by the smelling one,
Lucifer, fallen light...
Tell me stranger, what have I done?
Oh what's going on?

We should bring salvation,
not give in to his temptation - no!
Read and preach the holy world
and no forbidden lies that hurt.
I remember words of "seven".
Set me free - sanity!

[Lugaid]
Reach out for the light
far beyond confines.
You have read the magic lines
leading to the light in your mind...

[Gabriel]
In your mind?

3. Serpents In Paradise
[Gabriel]
Reading the madness they took her away
under the cross.
Bailiff and bishop and monk -
Malleus Maleficarum - the law

Prayed for salvetion, I fought for her soul -
scared by the horned.
The devil was creeping around
until she died in the flames as he saw.

Father forgive me for I've hardly seen
the human deep within. Just an intention -
so holy and clear - paving the way to madness
for us...

Serpents on the way to paradise -
dying for love, fighting for ages.
Serpents on their way to paradise -
raging with anger and pain for the cross.

[Jakob]
Father forgive me for what I have done.
For I betrayed the one that I loved like a son.
Demons and spells are they reality?

The pest and the schism; the power of the Moor
We've got to fight. Keep our people afraid...
Keep them away from what they shall not see.

I see a menace to our paradise
in these evil times.
Heaves is burning, people are yearning
for a new doctrine, they are...

[Gabriel]
Serpents on the way paradise.

[Jakob]
Don't know they'll end in final damnation.

[Gabriel]
Serpents on the way to paradise...

[Jakob]
Raging with anger and pain against the cross.

[Gabriel]
Lord if I'm an unbeliever - what do I believe?
Can you tell me lord what you had done
if you were me?
I have stared into the eyes
of innocence and fear.
I saw Anna in the tower in a lake of tears.
Something strange is going on and
still I don't know why.
I have stared into the secrets
they still try to hide.

Vandroiy can you tell me what you know about it all?
Vandroiy can you help me
to leave this prison hall?
Vandroiy can you help me
free Anna from the chain?
Vandroiy can you help me
to become a little sane?

Serpents on the way to paradise -
Dying for love, fighting for ages.
Serpents on their way to paradise
Raging with anger and pain...

4. Malleus Maleficarum
[Falk von Kronberg]
So, daughter of the old evil spirit, you still pretend
you don't know? Maybe we have a way to make you remember...

[Else Vogler]
I have done no wrong, blood shall come upon you!

[Falk von Kronberg]
Torturer, pull on!

5. Breaking Away
[Lugaid]
Don't wait my friend. We better don't think twice.
Time to fell the prison guard you gotta realize:
No turning back again. Therefor it's all too late...
New horizons wait...

I know the time has come
te leave your past behind.
And now the time has come
to stop them controlling your mind.

[Gabriel]
Breaking away!
All we can do now is break away.
Otherwise she will be dying
while both of us are lying here in chains.

Breaking away!
All we can do now is break away!
Oh - otherwise she will be dying
while both of us are lying here in chains.

Always been a novice in quest for paradise.
Hope they will forgive me for I apostatize.
I can't be no hypocrite, can't wear a masquerade...
New horizons wait...

[Lugaid and Gabriel]
And now the time has come to go another way.
To learn for life and to grow ripe
and prevent the decay...

[Gabriel]
Breaking away!
All we can do now is break away.
Otherwise she will be dying
while both of us are lying here in chains.

Breaking away!
All we can do now is break away!
Oh - otherwise she will be dying
while both of us are lying here in chains.

Breaking away!
It is so hard to lay down what I've been.
But I must go even if my way leads to Hades...

Breaking away!
All we can do now is break away.
Otherwise she will be dying
while both of us are lying here in chains.

Breaking away!
All we can do now is break away!
Oh - otherwise she will be dying
while both of us are lying here in chains.

6. Farewell
[Gabriel]
Days had come, winters had gone,
and we gamboled like siblings in Paradise.
I was your knight, holding you tight
as a brother when I saw your crying eyes.
Time went by and we had to say goodbye.

Staring up to the clouds above
Children - so little and sad.
Hoping the saints could help one day
Lead us together again.
Holding the key to the alley of dreams
still in hands.

Time telling me to say farewell
but I knew that I would fight hell
and I knew: We will
go for another time we can see,
for another time we'll be free,
for no more farewell.

[Anna]
Stepbrother tell me where have you been
when they brought me to this godforsaken place.
Sign of the cross - they took me away
for healing with herbs by the way of grace.
Now I wait for the day to feed the flames.

[Gabriel]
I have been caught in a cage of despair.
My heart as a monk's cell so empty and bare.
But no holy water can make me
forget you again...

Time telling me to say farewell
but I knew that I would fight hell
and I knew: We will
go for another time we can see,
for another time we'll be free,
for no more farewell.

[Lugaid]
No farewell could be the last one.
If you long to meet again...

7. The Glory Of Rome
[Falk]
Jesus Christ I'm coming - terrestrial home.
I'm allowed to guide their train
to visit you in Rome.
I am sick of preachers telling to be plain
while you got it nice in here.
They'd better feel ashamed.

[Johann Adam von Bicken]
Oh, ways of gold
lead is into Your blaze of fame.
Oh, are You waiting
for what we have brought You from hell?

[Gabriel]
Glory of Rome, glorious home.
Praising the king of the kings.
Glory of Rome, glorious home.
Reaching for haloes and wings.

[Johann Adam von Bicken]
Heading for the angels, heading for the feast,
heading for salvation and the ruin of the beast.
Let us fight the outcast, let us brin 'em fire,
let us lock the center of their wicked, mad desire.

Oh, ways of gold lead us into Your blaze of fame.
Oh, are You waiting
for what we have brought You from hell?

[Gabriel]
Glory of Rome, glorious home.
Praising the king of the kings.
Glory of Rome, glorious home.
Reaching for haloes and wings.

[Pope Clemens IIX]
Holding in my hand: Seven parts of a seal
to unlock the land of illumination I feel.
And it's been foretold: after touching the light
we shall lock the world.
But now it's our time to transcend,
the ultimate key in our hand.

[Gabriel]
Glory of Rome, glorious home.
Praising the king of the kings.
Glory of Rome, glorious home.
Reaching for haloes and wings.

8. In Nomine Patris
[instrumental]

9. Avantasia
[Gabriel]
Open my eyes
and see my bleeding wounded hands...
Feeling the pain too hard to stand. To stand...
Caught in the 'now and here'
while they are on the way.
Hiding imagination, leading us astray...

[Lugaid]
Use your mind!
You will leave the flesh dimensions behind.
Sanity can be the toll -
leading to the core of your soul.

[Gabriel and the voices in his head]
We are the power inside, we bring you fantasy.
We are the kingdom of light and dreams,
gnosis and life: Avantasia!
We are the power inside, we bring you fantasy.
We are the kingdom of light and dreams,
gnosis and life: Avantasia! - Avantasia...

Walking along the icy gallery of pain.
Tell me now: What can keep the flame alive?
Lack of imagination - raising up the tower
where they hold our souls
to take away the tower.

[Lugaid]
Use your mind!
You will leave the flesh dimensions behind.
Sanity can be the toll -
leading to the core of your soul.

[Gabriel]
We are the power inside, we bring you fantasy.
We are the kingdom of light and dreams,
gnosis and life: Avantasia!
We are the power inside, we bring you fantasy.
We are the kingdom of light and dreams,
gnosis and life: Avantasia!

Oh - Avantasia
Oh - I hear the voices
Oh - into the light
Oh - Avantasia...

10. A New Dimension
[instrumental]

11. Inside
[Elderane]
We're the little creatures
deep inside your mind.

[Regrin]
Some call us their fantasy
but some to never find.

[Elderane]
We can teach philosophy
but still we must commend...

[Regrin]
The state of our existence
right into your hand
Welcome to this place in here come overstep all your fears...

[Gabriel]
Where have you all been once
when I was alone?
When I was a hero in their crazy wicked show
you've sent no little spark
into my darkened view of life.
Did not make me ask for what is wrong
and what is right.

And still I regret to be here.
I'm dreaming of Anna in tears.

Inside - so deep inside
you will die if I don't dream anymore?
Inside - so deep inside
you will die if I don't dream anymore?

12. Sign Of The Cross
[Gabriel]
From a world of reign they come...

[Pope]
In a world of mammon we have found it all!
Fighting for pride and for gold.
But the key to the reign, to the ultimate control:
wisdom of the old.

We have been elect to drain the wine
of Gnosis to hide it and pray.
Got to save our children from the beast.
We are on the way.

[Elderane]
Remaining in darkness
the land of salvation will drown.
And when we'll have vanished
slavery will take your freedom down.

[Gabriel]
Seven eyes to be blind forever in time:
Sign of the cross...
Hell arise! Castigation under the sign,
sign of the cross - make us drown in altar wine.

[Bishop von Bicken]
In the heart of justice called Horeb long ago
Moses got carvings in stone.
Imposed to judge those who do not fear
the only, the holy, the lord.

[Gabriel]
The blood of anger and pain:
Ink of the Old Testament.
I know they'll end their crusade,
drown in the blood of the lamb.

[Elderane]
Remaining in darkness
the land of salvation will drown.
And when we'll have vanished
slavery will take your freedom down.

[Gabriel]
Seven eyes to be blind forever in time:
Sign of the cross...
Hell arise! Castigation under the sign,
sign of the cross - make us drown in altar wine.

[Regrin]
You have been the chosen one,
so welcome to this place.
Vandroiy's told us you would come
to help us win the race.
Bring back the seal from the men
who don't know what they do.
Seemed to be a fool without and own way of life.
But you've been a sleeping mind
and you woke up on time.
You've got the power to save us and finally you.

[Gabriel]
A dream is forever.
The land of salvation can't drown.
These enchanting colors -
who could have the might to tear it down?
(all these colors - fantasy...)

Seven eyes to be blind forever in time:
Sign of the cross...
Hell arise! Castigation under the sign,
sign of the cross - make us drown in altar wine.

13. The Tower
[Gabriel]
Where do I go?

Never had a very real dream before.
Now I got a vision of an open door.
Guiding me home, where I belong,
dreamland I have come.

Oh where do I go?

Never had a flesh and blood like this before.
Got a new appearance when I passed the door.
Is it a dream I am withing? Oh what's going on?

Down, down, down
Go down, go down, go down
I roam into nowhere.
Don't see an end: eternal wastelands.
And I hear the voice, the voice, the voice, the voice...

Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah...

Never been a fighter, never been a man.
But I must help Vandroiy, he's my only friend.
Nowhere to go and I know that he knows how
we will get her out...

Magic of transcendence
brought me to this place
A Vandroiy in reality lead me on my race.
Told me to bring back the seal
but still I don't know where I shall go.

[Lugaid]
Can't you 'feel' the voice?
You don't have a choice.
What a kind of life:
Freedom in flesh - shackles on your mind...

Go all the way to the tower!
Find out the secrets behind!
Go all the way to the tower!
For all the wisdom of ages doesn't die.

[Elderane]
Men have good intentions
on their way to the light.
But some of them are venal
and end up in the night.
Maybe it's better for you, mankind,
not to know what's going on.

[Gabriel]
Sometimes we must go
ways that seem to be wrong.
What a kind of life: Freedom in flesh,
shackles on your mind...

[Lugaid]
Go all the way to the tower!
Find out the secrets behind!
Go all the way to the tower!
Find out the name of the one
who reigns from inside...

[Voice in the Tower]
You have come the long way through ages
to bring me the seven parts of the seal.
So now throw it over the walls of the tower.
Throw the seal!

[Pope]
But first Godfather, what about the prophecy? What
about your reward: The ultimate illumination, the
gnosis and the power to defend your kingdom on
earth with a strong hand? What about the prophecy?

[Lugaid]
I realize...

[all]
For the glory, for the glory, for the glory,
For the glory. Oh - what is going on?
For the glory, for the glory, for the glory,
For the glory. Oh - what is going on?

[Lugaid]
Gabriel I can feel:
You have it back - book and seal.
Still no war is won, we have just begun...

Go all the way to the tower!
Long for the secrets behind!
Go all the way to the tower!
Found out the name of the one
who reigns from inside...

Go all the way to the tower!
Long for the secrets behind!
Go all the way to the tower!
Found out the name of the one,
Of the one...

[Jakob]
Oh, how could the stranger steal the seal away?
Was it my fault? Or was it no one's fault at all?

1. The Seven Angels
[Believers:]

Fire falling from the sky
Rage of god is coming down
Armaggeddon's drawing nigh
Sinner cry ! Heathen die !
Hear the toll of pain, gloria, gloria
In the fiery rain
Fire falling from the sky
Rage of god is coming down
Armaggeddon's drawing nigh
Sinner cry ! Heathen die !
Hear the toll of pain, gloria, gloria

Now the time has come, the end's begun
And the only one will come

[Gabriel:]

It has been foretold
By the visions of the old
And the madness in their eyes
Said his angel will arise
That's what they know : "Holy Lord it's over, oh god
We have done no wrong
So we go where we belong
To the neverending dream
But for those who lived in sin"
They claim to know : "Holy Lord it's over, oh god"

[Pope:]

Hey Angel, can you tell me
Will you lead us to the place
Full of heat, in the fire
For we only brought disgrace

[Lugaid:]

He is not the one. If they only knew

[Bishop:]

Hey Angel, will you take us
To the judgement of his rage
Hey will we die
For we couldn't close the gate

[Lugaid:]

To the knowledge as they have been told

[Gabriel:]

I don't know how could I prove
Nothing but the cloven hoof
Reigning over them as well
While they keep on fighting hell
Babylon the scarlet whore has come

We are the seven, judgement of heaven
Why don't we know : We are the angels
It's revelation, soul castignation
Fire will burn us away
We are the seven, judgement of heaven
Why don't we know : We are the angels
It's revelation, soul castignation
Fire will burn us away

[Pope:]

Redeemer, devastion
Hope it only has been ment 
For the sin of the dreamer
who broke the low you'd sent

[Lugaid:]

He is not the one. If they only knew

[Jakob:]

Hey, don't know but i wondered:
When we lost the seal again
Maybe stoned by the incense
Do we rise or just descent

[Lugaid:]

He is not the one. If they only knew

[Gabriel:]

I don't know how could I prove
Nothing but the cloven hoof
Reigning over them as well
While they keep on fighting hell
Babylon the scarlet whore has come

We are the seven, judgement of heaven
Why don't we know : We are the angels
It's revelation, soul castignation
Fire will burn us away
We are the seven, judgement of heaven
Why don't we know : We are the angels
It's revelation, soul castignation
Fire will burn us away

[Solo: Henjo Richter]

[Voice of the tower:]

Woe to you longing for the wisdom
Woe to you longing for the light
All my sons bring me back what is mine
Or you'll end burning in this night
Woe to you longing for the wisdom
Woe to you longing for the light
All my sons bring me back what is mine
Or you'll end burning in this night

[Solo: Timo Tolkki]

[Gabriel:]

Once I have been lost in what they told me to believe
Until I felt in burning deep inside to set my spirit free
And I escaped to another world to help the little men
who make me plunge into philosophy - to feel my
mind again... No one left to hold me tight - on the
`real`other side - but her in chains

I had been alone till the madman come along
With the knowledge and silver long beard
He was the first man ever teaching how I could be free
Helping me to find - oh - the mind and the soul
They've been trying to hide away...
And he promised we'd help Anna if I'd help him to
go all the way

[Lugaid:]

Go all the way into the world of minds
Open the gate and do not close behind
Prevent them from hiding the light away
Prevent them from tellin' us tales
Or the end of all they scare us with will be a
million empty brains...

[Gabriel:]

I could bring you what you told me
The seal they need to close the gate forever
But still I haven't found a meaning
Anna will we ever be together

[Regrin:]

You've been fighting for your soul
And sometimes it takes a toll
Hope one day you'll understand
What it means to hold in hands
What they call a fantasy
It is nothing but a key
To the world that now you're in
That they call a wicked dream

[Elderane:]

When you're walking on your own
When you're broken and alone
You may feel us from inside - 
on the other side of life.
Ohohohoh...

[Gabriel:]

I've been fighting for my soul
And sometimes it takes a toll
Hope one day we'll understand
What it means to hold in hands
What we call a fantasy
But it's nothing but a key
To the world that now I'm in
That we call a wicked dream

Oh, walking on my own
When I'm broken and alone
I may feel you from inside
From the other side of life

2. No Return
[Lugaid:]

Mental vigour's been right on the egde
To a 'stupefying' hole of no return
Now we dance a holy war is won
But there must be more we got to learn

[Gabriel:]

Don't you know that I'm here I must go
Into the morning light - illuminate the night
Be the guide on our side - the Gnosis

No return - I will go, follow the call of my spirit
No return - I must know all that I never could ask
No return

No I still can't leave the world in here
Soon I feel that I am gonna get her free
But I've smelled at and I long for more
Take me in, oh i beg, philosophy

Oh I got to know, more now so I must go on
Into the morning light - illuminate the night
Be the guide on our side - the Gnosis

No return - I will go, follow the call of my spirit
No return - I must know all that I never could ask
No return

Solo: Henjo Richter

[Eldrane:]

No return - maybe you must pay
Many've been in quest for truth
Insanity has swallowed away
No return - but I wish you all the best
Go and face the tree of knowledge and be free

[Gabriel:]

No return - I will go, follow the call of my spirit
No return - I must know all that I never could ask

3. The Looking Glass
[Gabriel:]

Drawn by the sound of that wild raving pound
No one has told me
I gotta know all about hell and below
They never told me

The quest for nexus
In your life and for all that's beyond...

[Gabriel:]

When I gaze at the man who is gazing at me
When I stare into the looking glass
When I ask what he sees
Then I'm asking for more and the more
that i wanna know
I know what I'll never know

[Tree of Knowledge:]

From far away, from the state of decay
You've come to wisdom
Many've been led, into madness instead
Toll of my kingdom
The quest for nexus has brought
Many men of genius to insanity

[Gabriel:]

When I gaze at the man who is gazing at me
When I stare into the looking glass
When I ask what he sees

[Tree of Knowledge:]

Then you're asking for more, and the more that
you wanna know
You know what you'll never know

[Solo: Henjo Richter]

[Tree of Knowledge:]

As long as you long for the whole
You can't get a part of at all
How proud would the buildings of Rome
Look without a single stone

[Gabriel:]

When I gaze at the man who is gazing at me
When I stare into the looking glass
When I ask what he sees
Then I'm asking for more and the more
that i wanna know
I know what I'll never know...

4. In Quest For
[Tree of Knowledge:]

Coming from the wastelands
Full of reason, common sense
Where their principles are blocking minds
And you don't understand
Giving you belief,
You never touch, you never see
But if you dare to try to grip it
you're accused for heresy

[Gabriel:]

Here I stand to find the truth
and for ought I know
You're the one to show me
You can tell my spirit how to grow

No, the more I try
The more confusion on my mind
And no matter how I try
I feel my eyes seem to stay blind

[Tree of Knowledge:]

No use in analysing, forget about alchemy
Because the secret of all truth
Is the quest for - and you'll feel

When you knock right on the door
"Forever locked" they say
A little man will let you in,
For you have always tried - to get inside

You're in quest for more to find the core
Your journey still ain't over
Your quest is your purpose, go on
You're in quest for more to find the core
It will be - never- over
Your quest is your purpose, go on ...

You're in quest for more to find the core...

5. The Final Sacrifice
[Gabriel:]

Staring into the lake, watching for heaven's sake
faces screaming in fear
Crying like at the stake, in the fiery waves
I can see all the souls how they suffer and howl
in their eternal pain
Service taking its toll, living life in hades

All the souls that left their mortal
frame if it's been dead or not
All the deaf who did not hear the truth

Get ready for the brimstone-
getting blisters on the eyes
The power of the spirit was their final sacrifice
Get ready for the brimstone-
getting blisters on the eyes
The power of the spirit was their final sacrifice

[Jakob's voice:]

Someone pullin' me out to come back to my flesh
Or I'm going insane !
In a world under Rome, in the fiery waves
Can't you see all the souls, how we suffer and howl
In our eternal pain
Service taking the toll, living life in hades...

Oh I see you standing on the
shore of castigation now
We don't wanna burn no more so pull us out,out,out

Get ready for the brimstone-
getting blisters on the eyes
The power of the spirit was our final sacrifice
Get ready for the brimstone-
getting blisters on the eyes
The power of the spirit was our final sacrifice

Get ready !

[Solo: Jens Ludwig]

Get ready for the brimstone...

6. Neverland
[Bishop:]

Cought in neverland, no purpose to be seen
There's no point of destination
Neverending wastelands, such a wicked odyssey
Don't know what we have done wrong
Lead us back to Rome to follow you again
Bring you the power, get salvation
I know less than all but more
than many who know less
I know it's keeping us strong

[Gabriel:]

And while they are pulling strings
While they are in command
They're hanging on strings
And fate they do commend into another hand

Cought in neverland, heat and fire, snow and ice
They call nether world what we call a paradise
Cought in neverland and their spirits cannot rise
From the nether world, they can't see a paradise

And the Roman whore, the masters and the slaves
Raging on without they don't know
Good intentions on their minds
Can't ask for why they bow out

[Bishop:]

Lead us to Eden, judge those who bite off more
than they can chew to serve, without they ask
Or call in doubt the ask

[Gabriel:]

Cought in neverland, heat and fire, snow and ice
They call nether world what we call a paradise
Cought in neverland and their spirits cannot rise
From the nether world, they can't see a paradise

[Solo: Henjo Richter]

Cought in neverland in the place of many eyes
Make it be what they are allowed to realize

Cought in neverland, heat and fire, snow and ice...

7. Anywhere
[Gabriel:]

I remember it was long ago
But when I think of her I fell it grow
Something begs me to come home again
Something I can hardly stand

But I'm to defy, I have to ignore her cry
I don't know what to do, I'm missing you so bad

Waiting for tomorrow, for a little ray of light
Waiting for tomorrow just to see your smile again
Take away my sorrow from a blistered heart of mine
Where are you now if you are there anywhere

Please forgive me for how I decide
But before I can come with rapid strides
Don't expect you'll have to understand
Jakob needs my helping hand

First I have to go one out of two ways
Wich both are wrong and I'm to go
So afraid, so ashamed
So deranged - but I know...

Waiting for tomorrow, for a little ray of light
Waiting for tomorrow just to see your smile again
Take away my sorrow from a blistered heart of mine
Where are you now if you are there anywhere

[Solo: Henjo Richter]

Waiting for tomorrow, for a little ray of light...
I can't wait for you - Are you there - anywhere

8. Chalice Of Agony
[Gabriel:]

Ah - Hugh !
Show me the way to he hallways
below Rome, I will be there
I've seen them burning in fire
They all bear too much to bear

[Elderane:]

Why don't you think of all those who will come
Don't you waste your life

[Gabriel:]

Don't you try show me the way
Don't need 'good advice'

[Elderane:]

Cold hallways so old, a chalice of gold
A guard as they say, paralyzed
Follow the cries from out of the blood
The wine in the cup

[Gabriel:]

Out of the wine, out of the chalice of agony
Welcome to Avantasia
Out of the wine, out of the chalice of agony
Welcome to Avantasia

[Gabriel:]

Regrin my friend we are passing the gate
Back into my world

[Regrin:]

I am afraid of the guard and I wish
Warnings had been heard

[Gabriel:]

Welcome to Rome, it's our mission
to make tortured spirits free

[Regrin:]

Something's in here, oh I wish I could hide
from its staring eyes

[Gabriel:]

Cold hallways so old, a chalice of gold
And I feel a chill
Staring eyes, while I hear the cries
From out of the blood, the wine in the cup

Out of the wine, out of the chalice of agony
Welcome to Avantasia
Out of the wine, out of the chalice of agony
Welcome to Avantasia

[Solo: Henjo Richter]

No way out, we got to run to the gate
No way out , for some of the souls it's too late
Jakob are you free

Out of the wine, out of the chalice of agony
Welcome to Avantasia
Out of the wine, out of the chalice of agony
Welcome to Avantasia

9. Memory
[Falk:]

Oh, I dare not to sleep anymore
Cause I see her face in every nightmare
In all the windows of my haunted house
And when I dream a dream of flowers
I wake up in my hand a bloody rose

'Blood shall come upon you'
So she spoke to me
Never knew she'd come back
Now she's on my dreams
From the faces in my dream
From an evil memory
As foretold in their prediction
From the faces in my dream
They are coming back for me
As it was told in their prediction
Is it just a dream
Or just a wicked memory ... Oh

Now I see her coming on her besom...
The smell of brimstone
And the mark of the beast
From the open window
Is it just a dream
As she's pulling out the dagger to stab
A thousand times into my hurting breast

Wake up from the nightmare
Screaming when I see her stand
with the face of Jakob
A bloody dagger in her hand

From the faces in my dream
From an evil memory
As foretold in their prediction
From the faces in my dream
They are coming back for me
As it was told in their prediction
Is it just a dream

[Gabriel:]

Maybe his conscience
Will send him a dream in his dreams
If I only knew - oh Anna -
If his soul also came free
Or maybe if Jakob
Would talk to the bailiff for you
I can't come for you

I don't know how many souls were set free
To start a rebellion, don't know if I'll still have to flee

[Solo: Jens Ludwig]

Oh that faces in my dream...
From the faces in my dream
From an evil memory...

10. Into The Unknown
[Anna:]

Heading for another life
In a new world far away
Why not me, oh Lord
Why did Vandroiy have to die, why

[Gabriel:]

Dreamers come and go
But a dream's forever
Freedom for all minds
Let us go together
Neverending ways
Got to roam forever
Always carry on

Walking down a misty road into the unknown
Heavy winds may blow into our faces
You can't kill the dream in killing the dreamer
Can't tear it down
Always carry on

Dreamers come and go
But a dream's forever
Freedom for all minds
Let us go together
Neverending ways
Got to roam forever
Always carry on

I've seen dreamers come and go

1. Twisted Mind
[Vocals by Tobias Sammet and Roy Khan]

[Psychiatrist (Roy Khan):]
One of a kind they say they've never seen before
Investigate the aberration, disorder in the core

[Scarecrow (Tobias Sammet):]
I never tried to hide away or tried to keep your pace
You walk me to the slaughter with a smile upon your face

[Chorus (Scarecrow):]
From the cradle to the madhouse, a twisted mind
There's no way out of this hell for twisted mind
There's no way out
There's no way out

[Psychiatrist (Roy Khan):]
You've come to see the healer, so don't you be afraid
They call me tranquilizer, I'm here to isolate
We paint in black and white and you're the dirty in between
Monstrosity of nature, a virulent disease

[Chorus]

[Psychiatrist (Roy Khan):]
Can't you see, can't you see
That you are not like anyone?
You'll never see through anyone else's eyes
And who am I to certify the sanity of a twisted mind
A victim of perception, a twisted mind

[x2]
Missprizing — chastising
Subhuman — fragmentizing
Sensation — aberration
Repulsive — tantalizing

[Scarecrow (Tobias Sammet) 2x:]
From the cradle to the madhouse, a twisted mind
There's no way out of this hell for twisted mind

There's no way out [x6]

2. The Scarecrow
[vocals by Tobias Sammet, Jorn Lande and Michael Kiske]

[Scarecrow (Tobias Sammet):]
I'm just a loser in the game of love
I'm just a stray boy in the shade
And how I wish to know what love is like
To find someone to contemplate

There's a voice and a million answers
To the questions I don't ask
A demon — I've got to contain
When I'm walking through the fen
Getting deep into the black
Whispers I can't restrain

Don't give in

[Chorus:]
Rise to fame — time will come
Make your claim — time has come
For the crow who fly away

[Mephistopheles (Jorn Lande):]
So you're an angel meant to walk down here
And you believe it's all divine
And you don't play by all those temporal rules
You watch the world begin to die

Alright — when the lamb's been torn to pieces
I've been crashing from the sky
Fallen to care for the prey,
they put a spoke right in your wheel
I'm the one to dare the weak,
to push you all over the pain
You give in — oh

[Chorus]

[Solo: Sascha Paeth]

[Scarecrow (Tobias Sammet):]
I close my eyes and I see what's coming my way
He's got treasure in his eyes that he's gonna turn to clay

[Mephistopheles (Jorn Lande):]
Hm, I'm a stranger,
I'm a changer
And I'm danger...
Maybe

[Scarecrow (Tobias Sammet):]
Fallen angel - waiting for the prey
The devil has come to take a maimed away
Penetration of the twisted mind
The evil is out for the weak and blind

I can feel it in your voice
Ever so sweet, no
Do I really have a choice? No, no, no!

[Mephistopheles (Jorn Lande):]
Oh, you burn your feet on unholy ground
You roam the barren wicked plains abound
In evil eyes and evil speak
Abound in all you evil freaks

When you say it's all divine and meant to be
What about your flesh and blood and defiers like me?

Their evil eyes are looking down on you
And those who don't are losing sight of you
Face the rage to chase away
The specter of disgrace and shame

Withered roses dying on the ledge
A withered dreamer standing on the edge
You dream of love—wake up to pain
You're better off to join in my game

She'll be better off to cry contrite tears
One day she'll wonder why she had to let you disappear
Oh dear

[Both]
Rise to fame — your time has come
Time will come to take the sun
Make your claim - you're drawn to the sound
Time has come — you're leaving ground

Rise to fame - the flight of the crow
Time will come - cross the line
Your time has come - for the crow to fly away

[Mephistopheles]
It's a flight to hell
Can you hear the bell?
The devil has come
To take your soul away
It's a flight to hell
alright

I'm a stranger
I'm a changer
And I'm danger
Fallen angel
Waiting for the prey

3. Shelter From The Rain
[Vocals by Tobias Sammet, Michael Kiske and Bob Catley]

[Scarecrow (Tobias Sammet):]
Like a wheel I keep on turning
Straight ahead, it's got me burning
The melody — the dignity,
Something is speaking to me
Night is cold and my soul is battered
Not afraid for the first time now that I realize
We coincide, I'll never belong to the tribe
And a song is calling me to this ship of fools

[Chorus:]
Been dying for a sign when faith has been on the line
When you find your love on wasted grounds
You're taking to the sound,
It's shelter from the rain

[Mentor (Michael Kiske):]
No return from the way I've chosen,
Cast away - chasing rainbows - condemn the lie
And how could I make god believe I am blind?
We create by intuition,
Call it fate — the tongue of angels in our soul
Feel it resound and carry you over the grind
All that's left is a song giving shelter from the rain

[Chorus:]
Been dying for a sign when faith has been on the line
When I find my love on wasted grounds
I'm taking to the sound
It's shelter from the rain

[Conscience (Bob Catley):]
It's a dark and stormy night.
Ain't it funny what it takes to read the signs?
But I am always there,
I am the footprints to your right
Man overlooks when riding high, young and blind
In your darkest lonely night,
Heed a voice to take you higher
Take you higher
As you stumble through the ruins, let the spirit take you higher, and a soul

[Scarecrow (Tobias Sammet):]
Oh, and a song
I can hear a song

[Chorus:]
Been dying for a sign when faith has been on the line
When you find your love on wasted grounds
You're taking to the sound
It's shelter from the rain
Been dying for a sign when faith has been on the line
When I find my love on wasted grounds
I'm taking to the sound
It's shelter from the rain

4. Carry Me Over
[vocals by Tobias Sammet]

[Scarecrow (Tobias Sammet):]
Never been told my prayers would be answered
Wherever I go I see you around
Never been told that something that beautiful
Would bring me up to let me down

Waiting up on the roof,
Waiting up in the rain
Just to catch a glimpse of your face
Even when you're around
Still I'm out of sight, out of sound
In your world I'm out of place

[Chorus:]
Carry me over, carry me over
Carry me over now
Carry me over, carry me over
Carry me over now

You're like a ghost that I can't let go
You follow every step that I take
Never thought someone could be too close to you
Now across the street is miles away

And now I might as well be the man in the moon
I am watching but you don't seem aware
But I won't be around
I'll be out of sight, out of sound
Someone's gonna wait somewhere

[Chorus 3x]

5. What Kind Of Love
[Vocals by Amanda Somerville, Tobias Sammet and Michael Kiske]

[Amanda Somerville:]
A dream of a dwelling inside
Alone we come and alone we go
And who am I to know what I feel:
Sympathy that's tearing me apart?
Attraction of the distance to a heart or affinity?

What if love will leave your heart an open sore
And I can't reveal what even I don't know?
The love you feel you waste away on me
What kind of love will let us bleed away?
No kind of love will make us bleed away

[Scarecrow (Tobias Sammet):]
If only you could be
The one to take a look inside
I feel so incomplete
A broken man in need of mother love
I'm suffering in silence and no one wants to see
The only god is watching as I bleed
The star above—my matching piece

[Amanda Somerville:]
Oh, this love will leave your heart an open sore
And I can't reveal what even I don't know
This love you feel you waste away on me
What kind of love will let us bleed away?
No kind of love will make us bleed away

[Scarecrow (Tobias Sammet):]
Feel—that's all you gotta do
And it will heal you
Feel the pain to lead you home to peace of mind
Dwell inside
Feel—that's all you gotta do
And it will heal the wound
Feel—there will be a song for peace of mind
Dwell inside

Michael Kiske (Helloween) — additional lead vocals

6. Another Angel Down
[Vocals by Tobias Sammet and Jorn Lande]

[Mephistopheles (Jorn Lande):]
I am the master of the game that's made a fool of you
I'm watching from the highest tower
You've got the aura to enchant them and a symphony
And I've got the power

You better taste: they call it life — my special area
I'm breeding winners over there
Ain't it a sin to turn your back on what you're given?
It's time to take your share

[Scarecrow (Tobias Sammet):]
God left me for dead - I've been turning my head
Away from the living - the time has come
To gamble for gain - to tear down the gate
And see what's inside

[Chorus:]
We rock the ball, been smashed to the ground
Arose from devotion to take a look and see what is inside
Sight of the crown: another angel down
We rock the ball, I'm facing my pain
A rage and a symphony driven by the wounds I cannot hide
Rise above the crowd: another angel down

[Scarecrow (Tobias Sammet):]
We'll see a black hole will be left up in the starry sky
We gotta mourn another angel
If I am just a light descending to caducity
It's still so far away

There's no tomorrow, I don't remember yesterday
I'm just living for tonight
And all the love I'm not gonna waste no more
I won't spit what's divine

[Mephistopheles (Jorn Lande):]
They left you for dead - turning your head
Away from the living - from flesh and blood
You've got the draw and desire to claw
For fortune and fame

[Chorus]

[Tobias Sammet (Edguy) - lead vocals & bass

7. The Toy Master
[Vocals by Alice Cooper and Tobias Sammet]

[Dealer (Alice Cooper):]
Don't you be afraid, come and step inside, take a look around
I'm your holy grail in your candy store to save you from the profound
They used to dream in only black and white
Can't you hear them scream, drowning in the tide?

[Pre-chorus:]
Out in the cold I see water frozen in their eyes
What a sorry sight
I am willing to believe they would pay for a smile

[Chorus:]
I'm the master of toys
And all you girls and boys
Are welcome to my wonderland.
I'm the angel of joy
And I'm here to paint the void.
Welcome to my world,

To my dream factory.

Say hello to the gentleman with the paint
The deeper you're in the blue, the sweeter the sound of your plaint
If only I had a heart it would break — oh sure
And I wonder how much more they can take

[Pre-chorus sung by Scarecrow (Tobias Sammet)]
[Chorus]

I'm dealing in pain
And a little Novocaine
Welcome to my world, to my toy factory

[2x]
No more struggle of the classes
No more struggle of the masses
On their knees, conformity
They are ready for a hero
They are flying at zero
It's their turn to crash and burn

[Chorus]

I come to bring you pain
And a little Novocaine
Welcome to my world.

8. Devil In The Belfry
[Vocals by Tobias Sammet and Jorn Lande]

[Scarecrow (Tobias Sammet):]
I dropped off in the shadows
The lead of a tragedy
I open my eyes — blind by the spotlight
And what do I see?

[Mephistopheles (Jorn Lande):]
Pushed by ambition,
Been granted admission
To the hall of acclaim,
She denied your affection,
Now listen, the whole world is screaming your name

[Scarecrow (Tobias Sammet):]
I will forget her but I won't forgive
The curtain has fallen, behold the messiah

[Chorus:]
Riding high,
The devil on the crest for all the world to see forevermore
I am I —
Devil in the belfry, I'll be glorified forevermore

[Mephistopheles (Jorn Lande):]
Is it a sin to learn to be able to live without love?
And is it a sin to put love under will and control from above?

[Scarecrow (Tobias Sammet):]
Devil in my fingers, pleasure at my feet
Mind out of sight
The shadow I'll cast shall darken her world
And ghost her at night

With each song you'll die a little for me
It won't leave a scar, 'cause I've drawn the curtain

[Chorus 2x]

[Mephistopheles (Jorn Lande):]
Into the opera like moths to the flame
Spellbind their senses to follow the hero

[Chorus 2x]

9. Cry Just A Little
[Vocals by Tobias Sammet and Bob Catley]

[Scarecrow (Tobias Sammet):]
A heart out of affection, night at the masquerade
You won some and you're lonesome as the spotlight fades
Going forth pretending destination is at hand
When she's crying just a little just for me

[Conscience (Bob Catley):]
I've seen them set off to the Promised Land
Escaping from the hurtings they don't understand
A sense of satisfaction on account of pristine tears
She's crying just a little more just like you

No, oh, no, no

[Chorus (Scarecrow):]
Why don't you cry, cry a little over me?
Why don't you lie?
Can't you tell me that I am hard to deny?
Can't you see what I am going through?
Cry just a little for me,
Oh, girl, a little for me

[Conscience (Bob Catley):]
Afraid to give away what you keep inside
There's a ghost in your mirror every lonesome night
All those nights are getting colder and your heart's a frozen wound
Don't you wonder who'll be there when you awake?

No, oh

[Chorus 2x]

10. I Don't Believe In Your Love
[Vocals by Tobias Sammet and Oliver Hartmann]

[Darkness (Oliver Hartmann):]
No one around to hear your cries
No one there to even realize you grit your teeth
What are you afraid to lose when you're left alone?
I'm the one to make you anything you wanna be

[Scarecrow (Tobias Sammet):]
Never broke the silence, never broke the ice
No more waiting, I gotta wipe her off my mind
Loving her is dying, loving her is pain
Babylon I'm coming, ready for the fray

I don't believe in your love, tread on this bed of roses
I don't believe in your love, don't give a fuck for roses

Don't give damn for roses, no, no, no

[Darkness (Oliver Hartmann):]
You've been standing on the edge,
Lost between the worlds of agony and ecstasy
Take your share boy straightaway, it's all heaven sent
She won't care: they call their love divine but it's all evil

[Scarecrow (Tobias Sammet):]
Loving you was bleeding so I had to break away
Darkness' stretching out its hand to save me from your sway
'Cause loving you was wasting, loving you was pain
Now angel of temptation, open up the gate

I don't believe in your love
Tread on this bed of roses
I don't believe in your love

Don't give a fuck for roses

[Scarecrow (Tobias Sammet):]
Loving you was bleeding, so I had to break away
Darkness' stretching out it's hand, to save me from your swear
'Cause loving you was wasting, loving you was pain
Now angel of temptation, open up the gate
'Cause loving you was wasting,

[2x]
I don't believe in your love, tread on this bed of roses
I don't believe in your love, don't give a fuck for roses

No I don't believe, I don't believe in your love
Your love, no, no, no, no
No I don't believe in your love

11. Lost In Space
[Vocals by Tobias Sammet and Amanda Somerville]

[Scarecrow (Tobias Sammet):]
Another star has fallen without sound
Another spark has burned out in the cold
Another door to the barren standing open
And who is there to tell not to give in, not to go?

[Chorus:]
How could I know, how could I know?
That I'll get lost in space to roam forever
How could I know, how could I see?
Feeling like lost in space to roam forever

I'm crawling down the doorway to the badlands
Been kicking down all your hurdles to the black
And all the damage fading in the rearview mirror
And the demons are calling me, they're dragging me away

[Chorus]

[Amanda Somerville:]
Lost in space, lost in time
Lost in space, lost in time
Lost in space

[Scarecrow (Tobias Sammet):]
How could I know, how could I?
How could I know, how could I know
That I'll get lost in space to roam forever?
How could I know, how could I see?
Feeling like lost in space to roam forever

Forever...

1. Avantasia (Edit)
Open my eyes and see my bleeding wounded hands
Feeling the pain too hard to stand.
To stand caught in the 'now and here'
while they are on the way
Hiding imagination, leading us astray

Use your mind!
You will leave the flesh dimensions behind
Sanity can be the toll
leading to the core of your soul

We are the power inside, we bring you fantasy
We are the kingdom of light and dreams, gnosis and life: Avantasia!
We are the power inside, we bring you fantasy
We are the kingdom of light and dreams, gnosis and life: Avantasia! Avantasia...

Walking along the icy gallery of pain
Tell me now: what can keep the flame alive?
Lack of imagination raising up the tower
where they hold our souls to take away the tower

Use your mind!
You will leave the flesh dimensions behind
Sanity can be the toll
leading to the core of your soul

We are the power inside, we bring you fantasy
We are the kingdom of light and dreams, gnosis and life: Avantasia!
We are the power inside, we bring you fantasy
We are the kingdom of light and dreams, gnosis and life: Avantasia!

2. Reach Out For The Light
Lord above - why don't you tell me
why I'm here in agony?
I've been serving, I've been praying
now I'm caught in misery

I've been praised by friar Jakob,
I misused his confidence
Cheated by this work of evil
feigning Anna's innocence

Oh what have I done?
So many ways lead to the fallen one,
Lucifer, fallen light...
Oh what have I done?
What is going on?

We should bring salvation,
not give in to his temptation  no!
Read and preach the holy world
and no forbidden lies that hurt
I remember words of "seven"
Set me free - sanity!

Reach out for the light
far beyond confines
You have read the magic lines
leading to the light in your mind...

What is right and what is wrong now?
Is it a trial of paradise?

Is Anna a witch or do they stick to an error?
What's the book and the seal inside?

Am I a cleric or maybe a sinner?
Unbeliever? Renegade?
Was it the devil who led me to "seven"?
Oh redeemer is it all too late?

Oh, what have I done?
I have been led by the smelling one,
Lucifer, fallen light...
Tell me stranger, what have I done?
Oh what's going on?

We should bring salvation,
not give in to his temptation  no!
Read and preach the holy world
and no forbidden lies that hurt
I remember words of "seven"
Set me free - sanity!

Reach out for the light
far beyond confines
You have read the magic lines
leading to the light in your mind...

In your mind?

3. The Final Sacrifice
Staring into the lake,
watching for heaven's sake faces screaming in fear
Crying like at the stake, in the fiery waves
I can see all the souls how they suffer and howl
in their eternal pain
Service taking its toll, living life in hades

All the souls that left their mortal
frame if it's been dead or not
All the deaf who did not hear the truth

Get ready for the brimstone
getting blisters on the eyes
The power of the spirit was their final sacrifice
Get ready for the brimstone
getting blisters on the eyes
The power of the spirit was their final sacrifice

Someone pullin' me out to come back to my flesh
Or I'm going insane!
In a world under Rome, in the fiery waves
Can't you see all the souls, how we suffer and howl
In our eternal pain
Service taking the toll, living life in hades

Oh I see you standing on the
shore of castigation now
We don't wanna burn no more so pull us out, out, out

Get ready for the brimstone
getting blisters on the eyes
The power of the spirit was our final sacrifice
Get ready for the brimstone
getting blisters on the eyes
The power of the spirit was our final sacrifice

Get ready !

Get ready for the brimstone
getting blisters on the eyes
The power of the spirit was our final sacrifice
Get ready for the brimstone
getting blisters on the eyes
The power of the spirit was our final sacrifice

4. Avantasia
Open my eyes and see my bleeding wounded hands
Feeling the pain too hard to stand.
To stand caught in the 'now and here'
while they are on the way
Hiding imagination, leading us astray

Use your mind!
You will leave the flesh dimensions behind
Sanity can be the toll
leading to the core of your soul

We are the power inside, we bring you fantasy
We are the kingdom of light and dreams, gnosis and life: Avantasia!
We are the power inside, we bring you fantasy
We are the kingdom of light and dreams, gnosis and life: Avantasia! Avantasia...

Walking along the icy gallery of pain
Tell me now: What can keep the flame alive?
Lack of imagination raising up the tower
where they hold our souls
to take away the tower

Use your mind!
You will leave the flesh dimensions behind
Sanity can be the toll
leading to the core of your soul

We are the power inside, we bring you fantasy
We are the kingdom of light and dreams, gnosis and life: Avantasia!
We are the power inside, we bring you fantasy
We are the kingdom of light and dreams, gnosis and life: Avantasia!

1. Lost In Space
Another star
has fallen without a sound
Another spark
has burned out in the cold

Another door
to barrens standing open

And who is there
to tell me not to give and not to go

How could I know? how could I know?
That I'll get lost in space to roam forever

How could I know? how could I see?
feeling like lost in space to roam forever

I'm crawling down
The doorway to the badlands
And kicking down

Are you heard: it's to the black
and all the damage
fading in the oblivion mirror
When the demons
are calling me, their dragging me away

How could I know?, how could I know?
That I'll get lost in space to roam forever

How could I know?, how could I see?
feeling like lost in space to roam forever

Lost in space
lost in time
Lost in space
Lost in Time
Lost in Space

How could I know, how could i know
How could I know, How could I know
That I'll get lost in space to roam for ever

How could I now, how could I see
feeling like lost in space to roam forever

Forever...

2. Lay All Your Love On Me
[ABBA Cover]

I wasn't jealous before we met
Now every man I see is a potential threat
And I'm possessive, it isn't nice
You've heard me saying that smoking was my only vice
But now it isn't true
Now everything is new
And all I've learned has overturned
I beg of you
Don't go wasting your emotion
Lay all your love on me

It was like shooting a sitting duck
A little small talk, a smile and baby I was stuck
I still don't know what you've done with me
A grown-up man should never fall so easily
I feel a kind of fear
When I don't have you near
Unsatisfied, I skip my pride
I beg you dear

Don't go wasting your emotion
Lay all your love on me
Don't go sharing your devotion
Lay all your love on me

I've had a few little love affairs
They didn't last very long and they've been pretty scarce
I used to think it was sensible
It makes the truth even more incomprehensible
'Cause everything is new
And everything is you
And all I've learned has overturned
What can I do

Don't go wasting your emotion
Lay all your love on me
Don't go sharing your devotion
Lay all your love on me

3. Another Angel Down
[feat. Jorn Lande]

I am the master of the game
that s made a fool you
I m watching from the highest tower
You got the aura to enchant them - and a symphony
And I have got the power

You better taste - they call it life: my special area
I m breeding winners over there
Ain't it a sin to turn your back
on what you re given
It s time to take your share

God left me for dead - I've been turning my head
Away from the living - the time has come
To gamble for gain - To tear down the gate
And see what's inside

We rock the ball
Been smashed to the ground
Arose from devotion
To take a look and see what is inside
Sight of the crown: Another angel down
We rock the ball
I m facing my pain
With a rage and a symphony
Driven by the wounds I cannot hide
Rise above the crowd: another angel down

We ll see a black hole will be left up in the starry sky
We gotta mourn another angel
If I am just a light descending to caducity
It s still so far away

There s no tomorrow
I don t remember yesterday
I m just living for tonight
And all the love I m not gonna waste no more
I won t spit what s divine

They left you for dead - turning your head
Away form the living - from flesh and blood
You've got the draw and desire to claw
For fortune and fame

We rock the ball
Been smashed to the ground
Arose from devotion
To take a look and see what is inside
Sight of the crown: Another angel down
We rock the ball
I m facing my pain
With a rage and a symphony
Driven by the wounds I cannot hide
Rise above the crowd: another angel down

4. The Story Ain't Over
[feat. Bob Catley & Amanda Somerville]

Rousing from dreams, craving for someone
Wept himself to sleep
He s waiting for a sign from above
Where is the love

The hourglass in pieces, dashed to the wall
The future is over
Tomorrow's been slipping away
And nothing remains

He'd known it won't last forever
She'd go ahead for a while

When you open your eyes
When you gaze at the sky
When you look to the stars
As they shut down the night
You know this story ain't over

When you open your eyes
When you gaze at the sky
When you look to the stars
As they shut down the night
You feel this story ain't over

Where is the candle in this lonesome night?
Angle why are you so wayward
Abandoning me, try my belief

When life is not words
and tongue is not answers
And we only can t see a reason
Why would it mean
that it's not meant to be

He'd known it won't last forever
She d go ahead for a while

When you open your eyes
When you gaze at the sky
When you look to the stars
As they shut down the night
You know this story ain't over

When you open your eyes
When you gaze at the sky
When you look to the stars
As they shut down the night
You feel this story ain't over

5. Return To Avantasia
[Instrumental]

6. Ride The Sky
[Lucifer's Friend cover]

[feat. Eric Singer]

Traveling this dark world, leaving light behind
seeing things I shouldn't see
new eyes I got to find
Mars Venus and stars shaking
their heads at me
No more today's - tonight I'll be riding the sky

Hey world look out I'm coming
Friends pass me by and you saw me humming
Mars Venus and stars shaking
their heads at me
No more today's - tonight I'll be riding the sky
Tonight ride the sky, tonight ride the sky

The smile on his face turn me to stone
The words that he spoke
wouldn't leave me alone
Mars Venus and stars
shaking their heads at me
No more today's tonight I'll be riding the sky
Tonight ride the sky, tonight ride the sky,

Tonight ride the sky
Tonight ride the sky...

1. Lost In Space
Another star
has fallen without a sound
Another spark
has burned out in the cold

Another door
to barrens standing open

And who is there
to tell me not to give and not to go

How could I know?, how could I know?
That I'll get lost in space to roam forever

How could I know?, how could I see?
feeling like lost in space to roam forever

The doorway to the badlands
And kicking down

Are you heard: it's to the black
and all the damage

When the demons

How could I know?, how could I know?
That I'll get lost in space to roam forever

How could I know?, how could I see?
feeling like lost in space to roam forever

Lost in space
lost in time
Lost in space
Lost in Time
Lost in Space

How could I know, how could i know
How could I know, How could I know
That I'll get lost in space to roam for ever

How could I now, how could I see
feeling like lost in space to roam forever

Forever...

2. Promised Land
Hey redeemer
Now what's become on me
taken in by promise
awakening in grief

Collecting us like puppets
you instrumentalize
A frigid trepidation
in a million puppet eyes

God gave his word just to let us down
Where is he now?

You've been facing heaven
You were lost to left alone
You re welcome to my home and
Found another heaven
It was you who took my hand
Come into the promised land

You scratched my back and I scratched yours
It s you who makes decisions
I just open up the doors

Whining in the gutter
They forget their sanctity
Welcome to my clockwork
Vanity machinery

You gave your word
You let me down
What am I now

You've been facing heaven
You were lost to left alone
You re welcome to my home and
Found another heaven
It was you who took my hand
Come into the promised land

Oh as far as the eye can see
They re bent in submission
Empty inside
An army of scarecrows like me
Thousands of brokens dreams
Thousands of tragedies
Tried to run from their destiny

Like moths to a flame
Driven by vanity
They been off to Jerusalem
Chasing a dream
Calling on me
We re just trading in needs

You've been facing heaven
You were lost to left alone
You re welcome to my home and
Found another heaven
It was you who took my hand
Come into the promised land

3. Dancing With Tears In My Eyes
[Ultravox Cover]

Dancing with tears in my eyes
Weeping for the memory of a life gone by
Dancing with tears in my eyes
Living out a memory of a love that died

It's five and I'm driving home again
It's hard to believe that it's my last time
The man on the wireless cries again
It's over, it's over

Dancing with tears in my eyes
Weeping for the memory of a life gone by
Dancing with tears in my eyes
Living out a memory of a love that died

It's late and I'm with my love alone
We drink to forget the coming storm
We love to the sound of our favourite song
Over and over

Dancing with tears in my eyes
Weeping for the memory of a life gone by
Dancing with tears in my eyes
Living out a memory of a love that died

It's time and we're in each other's arms
It's time but I don't think we really care

Dancing with tears in my eyes
Weeping for the memory of a life gone by
Dancing with tears in my eyes
Living out a memory of a love that died

Dancing with tears in my eyes
Weeping for the memory of a life gone by
Dancing with tears in my eyes

4. Scary Eyes
I spy with my little eye
Things you ll never see
Whispers burn my eardrum
It s eerie to the feel

I see them crawling up the wall
I see them staring at us all
Am I afraid of what I know

They look at you, they look at me
And as they look inquiringly
They scratch their heads
And watch the show

I can t explain, am I ashamed

Scary eyes watching every move
Fail to make out a reason
Scary eyes tracing what we do
At the tail of us fools

Extraterrestrial you follow me around
Not that I don t like you
Basically you re sound

Welcome to the Stone Age
Don t ask me to explain
Or you will crash the headlines:
Martian gone insane

You can t explain why you re insane

Scary eyes watching every move
Fail to make out a reason
Scary eyes tracing what we do
At the tail of us fools

Why are you afraid of little spider
Not a claudication
Or other complication
Why don t you just be a little wiser
You stick in a relation
Instead of fornication

I can t explain, am I ashamed

Scary eyes watching every move
Fail to make out a reason
Scary eyes tracing what we do
At the tail of us fools

5. In My Defense
[Freddy Mercury Cover]

In my defence what is there to say
All the mistakes we made must be faced today
It's not easy now knowing where to start
While the world we love tears itself apart
I'm just a singer with a song
How can I try to right the wrong
For just a singer with a melody
I'm caught in between
With a fading dream

In my defence what is there to say
We destroy the love - it's our way
We never listen enough never face the truth
Then like a passing song
Love is here and then it's gone

I'm just a singer with a song
How can I try to right the wrong
For just a singer with a melody
I'm caught in between
With a fading dream

I'm just a singer with a song
How can I try to right the wrong
I'm just a singer with a melody
I'm caught in between with a fading dream
Caught in between with a fading dream
Caught in between with a fading dream

Oh what on earth
Oh what on earth
How do I try
Do we live or die

Oh help me God
Please help me

6. Lost In Space (Epic Version)
Another star
has fallen without a sound
Another spark
has burned out in the cold

Another door
to barrens standing open

And who is there
to tell me not to give and not to go

How could I know?, how could I know?
That I'll get lost in space to roam forever

How could I know?, how could I see?
feeling like lost in space to roam forever

I'm crawling down
The doorway to the badlands
And kicking down

Are you heard: it's to the black
and all the damage
fading in the oblivion mirror
When the demons
are calling me, their dragging me away

How could I know?, how could I know?
That I'll get lost in space to roam forever

How could I know?, how could I see?
feeling like lost in space to roam forever

Lost in space
Lost in time
Lost in space
Lost in (Lost In) Time
Lost in Space
Lost in time
Lost in space

How could I know, how could i (how could i) know
How could I know, How could I know
That I'll get lost in space to roam for ever

How could I now, how could I see
feeling like lost in space to roam forever

Forever...
Forever...
Lost in space
Lost in time......

1. Stargazers
[Scarecrow]
We have roamed the plains a million years
Gathered at the shore
When we had run out off all fears

[Inspiration]
We have come from everywhere
Crumbling worlds behind
Reason is what we're gonna give
To be given peace of mind

[Mephistopheles]
Crimson is the pavement
Blood is dripping from our dreams
To the sound of smashing yesterdays
We dance in ecstasy

[Scarecrow]
Oh craving devour me, take me away
Oh to infinity, take me away

[Mephistopheles]
Take me away
Oh yeah take me away
Far away

[Scarecrow]
Don't you turn your face to the night sky
Said the fainthearted one
You may see through the charades
An instant that won't come undone

I can feel the ease of my pain
Decline of the blood reason level
Gazing in awe bystanders scream
Mentally critical fettle

[Mentor]
We're sailing on gentle waves
We read the sky

Stargazers, stargazers
Behold the key
Stargazers, stargazers
Infinity
Reason left behind

[Scarecrow]
Where are you detecting the wrongs
Spirit that always denies
I've gone insane
Release me from waiting
For the sparkle to rise

[Mephistopheles]
I can see they're nailed to the cross
Cannot live till they're gone
Immortal they cry on terrestrial embers
While they laugh at the clown

[Mentor]
You feel a chill as if time stood still
There's no way out

Stargazers, stargazers
Behold the key
Stargazers, stargazers
For a lucid dream
You'll leave the world behind

[Scarecrow]
Oh craving devour me
Release me, please, take me away
To infinity, oh take me away
Craving devour me
Take me, take me away

[Mentor]
Stargazers, stargazers
Behold the key
Stargazers, stargazers
Infinity, reason left behind

[Darkness]
When the sun rose to wake another day
they were gone, gone without a trace
Babylon, craving in lucidity
Babylon, the fire will remain

And the sun razes from their memory
What the dark had cyphered in the sky
And the flame's burning their lucidity
Babylon, rise up to the night

[Mephistopheles]
Oh, let us wander
let us wander between the worlds
We override their principles
Abrogate horizons
Abandon mental gravity
Oh, we overrule the eye
Compromise your sanity
To heaven
To hell

2. Angel Of Babylon
[Scarecrow]
You turn off the light
And you won't make no difference
You hear the echoes fade away
When the cries of despair
Turn to a sound in distance
The road ain't divine
Black are the wings that will carry me home

[Mephistopheles]
Tower in the night, up to the sky
Carry our remains, angel of light
To the dark side of Paradise

[Scarecrow]
On wings of fire to the back side of light
From Babylon to Paradise I crawl
I've seen iniquity galore
Been worth a detour and some more
The snake in the backyard of heaven

Venus guiding to the back door of love
From Babylon to Paradise we're drawn
I've seen iniquity galore
Been worth a detour and some more
The snake in the backyard of heaven

I feel how I faint as I'm crossing the Acheron
Wash away my innocence
Was I losing my way
When the sky has been blackened
This short cut of evil
Where do they drive me?
Where will I go?

Days gone by, time after time
I'm going insane, losing my mind
To the dark side of Paradise

On wings of fire to the back side of light
From Babylon to Paradise I crawl
I've seen iniquity galore
Been worth a detour and some more
The snake in the backyard of heaven

Venus guiding to the back door of love
From Babylon to Paradise I'm drawn
I've seen iniquity galore
Been worth a detour and some more
The snake in the backyard of heaven

On wings of fire to the back side of light
From Babylon to Paradise I crawl
I've seen iniquity galore
Been worth a detour and some more
The snake in the backyard of heaven

Venus guiding to the back door of love
From Babylon to Paradise I'm drawn
On through shadows, I've seen iniquity galore
Been worth a detour and some more
The snake in the backyard of heaven

3. Your Love Is Evil
> [Scarecrow]
Day after day I see her smile
If you could see her through my eyes
You wouldn't call her a little boy's fever dream

How can you tell my feelings wrong?
How can't you see it's growing strong?
Silicone angel, you are my fantasy

Your eyes are cold
Pale are your skin and your lips
Pale is your desire

You are the one
Day after day under your spell
And you look away
Your love is evil

You are the one
Day after day
You are the rain
I'm the parade
Though your love is evil

I feel how you watch my every move
Why do you lie to me? And you
Your languidness shining through a crystal wall

Nobody would touch you like I would
Nobody would stop us
If I could reach out through the glass
Pretend you don't hear my call

Your eyes are cold
Pale are your skin and your lips
Pale is your desire

You are the one
Day after day under your spell
And you look away
'Cause your love is evil

You are the one
Day after day
Under your spell
And you look away
Though your love is evil

[Solo]

You are the one
Day after day under your spell
And you look away
Your love is evil

You are the one
Day after day
You are the rain
Still I'm the parade
Though your love is evil

4. Death Is Just A Feeling
[Madman]
Living in the darkness
What a cold and lonely night
Voices in the darkness
Sing a sweet sweet lullaby

Something's coming nearer
Anyone to join in a game, a game?
Welcome to the attic
Hospitality is my name

Eyes so alive
I've been feeling pretty dead for quite a while
Gimme a smile

Dead and alive
Come a little closer
You and I:
Affiliates forevermore
And I'm alive
Death is just a feeling
You and I, swapping finitude and love for diamonds
I'm just a little pale

Don't hesitate to sign right here
Don't be afraid to come with me
Specialized in temporizing
Dead to faulty love and time, faulty time
We'll be dancing here forever and a while
Day by day

Dead and alive
Come a little closer
You and I:
Affiliates forevermore
And I'm alive
Death is just a feeling
You and I, swapping finitude and love for diamonds

[Scarecrow]
Value by value
I'm gonna turn into breath after breath
Love we trade in for silver
Defy what they use to call death
And dust covered treasures will shine again
An unseen accolade
Larger than life, a memory
Death will be just a charade

[Madman]
Dead and alive
Come a little closer
You and I:
Affiliates forevermore
And I'm alive
Death is just a feeling
You and I, swapping finitude and love for diamonds
I'm just a little pale

5. Rat Race
[Mephistopheles]
There'll be fireworks tonight
Everybody's on their knees
Admiration for the one
Riot in a dead-end street
Don't be afraid to hear his voice
Tells you lies you wanna hear

[Scarecrow]
You just listen and obey
Got the ticket in your hand
A new religion for the mob
For everyone to understand
We're all just clockwork toys tonight
And salvation is drawing near

The snow covered opera tonight
Enchanted with dilated eyes

Living in a rat race
Dying in a rat race
Burning in the stream again
Why should I dare to break away

Living in a rat race
Living in a rat race

I got sulfur in my veins
Devil watching through my eyes
I got beauty, I got brains
And there's no one to defy
I've got the power in my fingers
And the opera in my hands

The onset of winter tonight
The mirror, it gives me a smile

Living in a rat race
Dying in the rat race
Burning in the stream again
Why should I dare to break away

Speeding in the rat race
Bleeding in the rat chase
Burning in the stream again
Why should I dare to break away

Living in the rat race
Dying in the race
Burning in the stream again
Why should I dare to break away

Speeding in the rat race
Bleeding in the rat chase
Burning in the stream again
Why should I dare to break away

6. Down In The Dark
[Mephistopheles]
All of a tremble
You can feel their poison arrows
Have left their mark
Higher and higher
Wanna seize the day
While you're waiting for the dark

You're running from the disdain
You know this time
You won't turn around
Chasing an illusion, disillusion
Desire leading, downward bound

Into the black
You are tracing the riddle
Where no man's been
No turning back
No more lost in the middle
Never again, never again
Once you have opened your eyes
Down in the dark you'll be crossing the line

[Scarecrow]
I'm a believer on the receiving end
Of the bat they hold with grace
Dead to the voices of the anxious
Timid of him who must not be named

Enticing me away now as the sun sets
To the truth that lies beyond
I'm chasing an illusion, an illusion
Revelation, I'm coming home

Into the black
You are tracing the riddle
Where no man's been
No turning back
No more lost in the middle
Never again, never again
Once you have opened your eyes
Down in the dark you'll be crossing the line

You turn your back on the one
Willing to make up his mind
No, you never stood in my shoes
Evil versus divine
You're feeling drawn to purity
Like a moth to the flame
Light at the end of the tunnel
Strange how the voice of the savior
Roars like a train

Into the black
You are tracing the riddle
Where no man's been
No turning back
No more lost in the middle
Never again, never again
Once you have opened your eyes
Down in the dark you'll be crossing the line

7. Blowing Out The Flame
[Scarecrow]
I sold my soul for diamonds
And reason for acclaim
Been begging for white angels
To blow my mind away

Been growing funny flowers
Where roses never grew
I stayed awake all night
When I woke up from dreams of me and you

I tried to take the sun and I went blind
God help me to erase you from my mind

I'm growing cold
And the night is yet to come

Can anyone tell me is this
The way it's meant to be?
Lost and isolated
I'm way too complicated
For you to lean on me
I play a losing game
I cried in desperation
Mental devastation
I'm blowing out the flame

Self-pity gave me shelter
I always hid away in vice
Dyslexic, torn and tattered
I tried to read the signs

You never tried to take a look at the one I'd have died to be
Now it seems you don't see me at all

Was it all worth it? Visions holding sway
When the real thing got lost along the way

Yes anyone tell me is this
The way it's meant to be?
I'm lost and isolated
Way too complicated
For you to lean on me
I play a losing game
I cried in desperation
Mental devastation
I'm blowing out the flame

Yes anyone tell me is this
The way it's meant to be
Lost and isolated
I'm way too complicated
For you to lean on me
I play a losing game
I cried in desperation
Mental devastation
I'm blowing out the flame

8. Symphony Of Life
[Other]
Tonight, tonight, tonight
Heal me, heal me

Yes in the darkness of the night
I know there's someone near me
I can't explain but it's all right
As long as this won't leave me

I give to you my sacrifice
My virgin creed, my passion
I'm torn in two but all my life, my life
My life I'll wait for you

To near me
And reveal me

Rush tonight
We play the darkest of all symphonies
And in a flash of light
Then it'll all become the symphony of life
Of life, my life

Heal me

And in the deepness of my dreams
I know it's you that haunts me
In blood I swear my purity
And save my treasures for you

I give to you my sacrifice
And lay my burden down
Am I deranged that all my life, my life
My life I wait for you?

To cease me
And release me

Rush tonight
We play the darkest of all symphonies
And in a flash of light
Then it'll all become the symphony of life
Of life, my life

You haunt me, chase me like a beast
And with a taste so bittersweet
You love me, grieve me 'til I'm mad
Now is the moment

Rush tonight
We play the darkest of all symphonies
And in a flash of light
Then it'll all become the symphony of life
Of life, of life...

Rush tonight
We play the darkest of all symphonies
And in a flash of light
Then it'll all become the symphony of life
Of life, my life

9. Alone I Remember
[Scarecrow]
I've been walking down this road
With a suitcase full of dreams
I've seen my demons come and go
To show me what I need

Madness, walking dynamite
Been dancing on the edge
They got me by the fuse
Smiling with a match

I wanted love, I wanted life
Been striving for a new direction
I wanted out, I wanted more
I wanted to forget the damage left behind

But I recall the dream I had
When I kept moving on
Can't stand to remember

I recall
No turning back
Now I'm moving on
Alone I remember

[Mephistopheles]
Raise your head
Got stars above and emptiness below
Think of what you'd never had
And would have never known

You wanna turn your back on me
Condemn this pleasure dome
Make sure you won't regret
Mistaking friend for foe, no

You're at the gates,
You're on the edge,
I've seen them falling back to nowhere,
You're off the red, out of your head,
And you will wish you'd never seen it all

[Scarecrow]
I recall the dream I had
When I kept moving on
Can't stand to remember
I recall
No turning back
Now I'm moving on
Alone I remember

Oh, and I recall I used to have a dream
I won't forget that moment of glory

But I recall the dream I had
When I kept moving on
Can't stand to remember
I recall
No turning back
Now I'm moving on
Alone I remember

I recall the dream I had
When I kept moving on
Can't stand to remember

I recall the dream I had
When I kept moving on
Alone I remember

I recall, I recall the dream that I had
I recall
No turning back
Now I'm moving on
Alone I remember

10. Promised Land
[Scarecrow]
Hey redeemer
Now what's become on me
Taken in by promise
Awakening in grief

Collecting us like puppets
You instrumentalize
A frigid trepidation
In a million puppet eyes

[Mephistopheles]
God gave his word just to let us down
Where is he now?

You've been facing heaven
You were lost and left alone
You're welcome to my home and
Found another heaven
It was you who took my hand
Come into the promised land

You scratch my back and I scratch yours
It's you who makes decisions
I just open up the doors

Whining in the gutter
They forget their sanctity
Welcome to my clockwork
Vanity machinery

[Scarecrow]
You gave your word
You let me down
What am I now

You've been facing heaven
You were lost and left alone
You're welcome to my home and
Found another heaven
It was you who took my hand
Come into the promised land

[Scarecrow]
Oh, as far as the eye can see
They're bent in submission
Empty inside
An army of scarecrows like me
Thousands of broken dreams
Thousands of tragedies
Tried to run from their destiny

[Mephistopheles]
Like moths to a flame
Driven by vanity
They've been off to Jerusalem
Chasing a dream
Calling on me
Just trading in needs

You've been facing heaven
You were lost and left alone
You're welcome to my home and
Found another heaven
It was you who took my hand
Come into the promised land

You've been facing heaven
You were lost and left alone
You're welcome to my home
Found another heaven
It was you who took my hand
Come into the promised land

11. Journey To Arcadia
[Conscience]
A lonely boy, a handful of dreams
Cold wind blows through a heart wired-in
Open skies he would explore
No, there ain't no mastery
Of a passion and a deep blue love

Yearn to see far away places
One day he'd feel two hearts collide
In his eyes tears and desire
But he prays and he swears every night
One day scales will fall from her eyes

[Inspiration]
Just with a dream
Just with a dream and with a song
On my own, I may stumble and fall
It don't matter at all when you're blessed with
Just what's yet to come, what's yet to come

[All]
Burning feet on the ground
Got your head in the clouds
You're out to find Arcadia
And you know you will stand
What you can't comprehend
Journey to Arcadia

[Scarecrow]
The more I see, I understand
That there ain't nothing that I know
As I awake on padded ground
The final curtain of the show

When dogs run barking
And I don't hear no sound
And the sky is as blue
As eyes have never seen it
Then I remember
What I'd have been dying for
Faith, rescue my dream
From a role that I've been put in on their screen

[Inspiration]
Your eyes, and as I look into your eyes
We're at the crack of dawn
Life will stop telling lies
And destiny will know
It's just you and I

[All]
Burning feet on the ground
Got my head in the clouds
Journey to Arcadia
And I know I will stand
What I can't comprehend
Journey to Arcadia

[Conscience]
The more we see, we understand
That there's a lot that we don't know
As you awake on padded ground
The final curtain of the show

[Scarecrow]
Far from eye but close to heart
No matter how we try
Can't repel the counterpart
Our common bond we can't defy

[Inspiration]
I've seen them standing at the crossroads
When they were waiting for a sign
And they unlearned to face the silence
As they unlearned to turn inside

You're turning to the sky
And you're dying for an angel
If you want it bad enough, see those eyes
That's where two glances collide

Learn to breathe, learn to crawl
Learn to stand, walk and fall
Learn to lose and to love, to believe, to rise above
Love is more than to love

[All]
Burning feet on the ground
Got your head in the clouds
You're out to find Arcadia
And you know you will stand
What you can't comprehend
Journey to Arcadia

[Scarecrow]
The more I've seen, I understand
That there ain't nothing that I know now
As I awake on padded ground
The final curtain of the show

1. Spectres
[Music & lyrics by Tobias Sammet]

[Aaron Blackwell]
Through the shimmer on this cold alley paving
See the moonshine painting the ground
Cobble stones keeping tales that remain untold
More than ages old

Brewing mist like a shroud on the damp floor
Hear it whisper lucidity away
Ornate cold is the king of these streets tonight
The void is taking hold!

Make haste as the wind's getting colder
It's chasing the dreamer away.

Wide open minds will divine without reason
Cold is the night as you're braving the gale
Wide open eyes
A spectre is breezing through the moonlit sky

[Science & Zeitgeist]
See them guises on the prowl, what a show!
Feel them shadows drag you into a nightmare
To the melody of which you don't know
If it's really there

Dance in the gloom, dance in the gloom
Every move is a step to your tomb
We're the machine that's gonna make you dream
Phantasmagoria

[Aaron Blackwell]
Time flies from the space of an hour
Telling tales in the poorhouse they say...

Wide open minds will divine without reason
Cold is the night as you're braving the gale
Wide open eyes
A spectre is breezing through the moonlit sky

[Lead Guitar: Sascha Paeth]

[Aaron Blackwell]
Wide open minds will divine without reason
Cold is the night as you're braving the gale
Wide open eyes and a spectre is breezing
Cold is the night as you're braving the gale
Wide open minds - once upon the moonlit night...

2. The Watchmakers' Dream
[Music & lyrics by Tobias Sammet]

[Science]
Welcome to the aftermath of the incidence
That made the tower fall
Another screw to another wheel
For another mind won't stray away anymore
Oh won't stray away from its brain
Oh no...

We must finalise the giant
To level off the void and zeroise the will
The time will come: you will know what you need

The Watchmakers' Dream
The Watchmakers' Dream

[Aaron Blackwell]
Simplify simplicity
You don't mind what you don't see at all

[Science]
The tongue of nations brought in line
Reason occupied: the God-machine oh
A splendid steaming dram will tower to the sky

[Aaron Blackwell]
We'll exploit another 'morrow
We drained another day
The glowing of the future in our eyes
And time will reveal what we need:

The Watchmakers' Dream
The Watchmakers' Dream

[Lead Guitar: Arjen Anthony Lucassen]

[Lead Organ: Ferdy Doernberg]

[Science]
We must finalise the giant
To zeroise the will and level off all minds
The time will come that you
will know what you need

[Aaron Blackwell]
The Watchmakers' Dream
The Watchmakers' Dream

[Science]
The Watchmakers' Dream - Will we slice infinity
The Watchmakers' Dream - For all the world to see
The Watchmakers' Dream - We give you what you need
The Watchmakers' Dream - The sound of triviality

3. Black Orchid
[Music & lyrics by Tobias Sammet]

[Aaron Blackwell]
I never wanted guidance
To tell me where to find
A light in the darkness
Cause the dark I'd push aside
No time for dreaming of a distant Paradise
No time for tales of good and evil

[Reason]
Another correlation: as above so below
Another analysing where illusions fail to show
the face of the maker who'd leave you alone
without a sense of comprehension

[Aaron Blackwell]
When the meadow - in front of my eyes - will have dried away
Will my senses wither like flowers on my grave
Will this wave of becoming flow into the void of time

The final hour:
When Never and Now become one
Will I find the orchid
The final hour:
Door to the garth of eternity?
Or withered orchid meadows?

[Reason]
Everybody's praying
But what if God is just a threat
and everybody's straying?
If only they would just forget
everybody's craving
for a ghost light in the haye:
You'll lose your minds one after another

[Aaron Blackwell]
Everybody's craving
for what doesn't have a name or a face
So reason could fit it in the frame
In quest of the orchid:
A glimmer in the daze
Till I awake to the sound of rigour

[Reason]
What if that meadow in your mind is just a fantasy?
And if it wanted to be seen why must you believe?

[Aaron Blackwell]
Will this wave of becoming flow into the void of time

[Reason]
The final hour
When Never and Now become one

[Aaron Blackwell]
Will I find the orchid

[Reason]
The final hour
Door to the garth of eternity

[Aaron Blackwell]
Or withered orchid meadows

Black orchid
Strange and beautiful
Oh black orchid I must find you

[Reason]
I remember that morning
He had to be told
What he couldn't remember
After he'd spoken to the wall

[Aaron Blackwell]
And I gave to repression
What I must not have seen
What even believers
Must unlearn to unbelieve

[Lead Guitar: Bruce Kulick]

[Aaron Blackwell]
The final hour
When Never and Now become one
Will I find the orchid
The final hour
Door to the garth of eternity

[Reason]
Or withered orchids
The final hour
When Never and Now become one

[Aaron Blackwell]
Will I find the orchid

[Reason]
The final hour
Door to the garth of eternity

[Aaron Blackwell]
Or withered black orchid meadows

4. Where Clock Hands Freeze
[Music & lyrics by Tobias Sammet]

You're caught in the land of no sun
Without reason or rhyme
You're avid for splendour
The spin of the hand is your pace on the run
We got no time to turn
When we strive after grandeur

Here you got your hero slicing up your ecstasy
On the verge of lunacy
There's no time to lose
No chance to refuse - ah

Will you deny what you see
(as you) tear down the nature of reason
That has shown you the way
Where clock hands freeze

I know what I see
And I know what I don't
Through your dark swamp
I walk on deductive conclusion

A little more time?
I admit I would take
But then again
It would mean more time for confusion

You think you got your prodigy
Everytime your eyes don't see
Victim of perplexity
There's no time to lose
No need to refuse

Will you deny what you see
Tear down our nature of reason
That has shown you the way
Where clock hands freeze

Will you deny what you see
Tear down our nature of reason
That has shown you the way
Where clock hands freeze

5. Sleepwalking
[Music & lyrics by Tobias Sammet]

Wandering barefoot into nowhere
Just another winter's night
And I don't fell gravity anymore
You'd never lie, never cry
Never talk me out of dreams
And a dream is what remains

Tell me don't you see what ain't there
When you look in the mirror
You're starving away like a candle burning down
Miles, away miles away
You've been cutting off the rope
Letting go and losing ground

And I…
Wonder who's to blame
As I…
Sleepwalk in the rain
It's my, my silent victory over gravity
And I…
Sleepwalk in the rain

Winter sky far and wide 
Caving in on you and me
Like a brittle wall of the emerald room:
The hall of fame and dying dreams
The love we'd die for: Petrified
I wanna know: Does a frozen river flow

And I…
Wonder who's to blame
As I…
Sleepwalk in the rain
It's my, my silent victory over gravity
And I…
Sleepwalk in the rain

And I…
Wonder who's to blame
As I…
Sleepwalk in the rain
It's my, my silent victory over gravity
And I…
Sleepwalk in the rain

6. Savior In The Clockwork
[Music & lyrics by Tobias Sammet]

I envision how you lie awake and agonise
Over ways to bear your day just every night
Re-alignment you're in need of so imploringly
It's the pace that we'll maintain for you

Oh every moment everybody's gonna think alike
Every second will be seized
While every in between we'll erase
To take the tangle from their memory
Maximising one and all for you

Now into line bring them peace of mind
Mind by mind
Se the pace for all mankind
Let us take away the spaces
In between their given time

Time to run!
Savior in the clockwork tell me
For how long will I wait on the grind
Time flies on 
(Time will fly on)
Savior in the clockwork take me back inside
In between the time

Now am I half asleep or half unconscious, 
Half 'adream'?
I can't move as I am stuck in bright lucidity
I can feel and hear and see
But I won't comprehend
I see fire that I won't decipher

I see giant evil tower to a blackened sky
I feel blessed with evidence of what I can't define
Swinging blade of the lowering perpendicular
I see clarity I won't remember

Do I dream
Is it only fantasy and matter just a thought I see
And time is all they need to seal away eternity

Time to run!
Savior in the clockwork tell me
For how long will I wait on the grind
Time flies on 
(Time will fly on)
Savior in the clockwork take me back inside
In between the time

You pry into a world too far above
Your head up in the haze
Journey to the birth of the first sun
Into the black womb of space
Father primal space oh yeah
Who's drawn the light…

Standing at the door to epiphanic realisation
A journey to the centre of forever
To the mystery of creation

Don't you hear the voice: I'm with you
I'm everywhere and real
You can see me, you can hear me without credence
I'm what your hands can feel

God, I feel I've been away too long
I feel like I've been dreaming

If you'd open up your door to explanation
You would hear the voice of reason screaming

I've seen the ocean swallow the ancient harmony
And I've seen belief and craving swallow sanity

I feel my hand is led to ink between the lines
Tall stories legendising: figments of the lie

At crack of dawn hazy remains above my mind
Raise your mind
I scribble down those icons that I can't define
Will they demand account as I'd demand myself
Raise your mind
I'll never testify what no man comprehends

And they will tear to pieces what they can't define
Raise your mind
If you don't follow your self- preservation drive
They'll crucify the one who won't affiliate
Raise your mind
But decorate the children of their own ego's way

Time to run savior in the clockwork
Tell me for how long will I wait on the grind
Time flies on
(time will fly on)
Savior in the clockwork

Take me back inside
In between the time
Time to run!
Savior in the clockwork tell me
For how long will I wait on the grind
Time flies on 
(Time will fly on)
Savior in the clockwork take me back inside
In between the time

7. Invoke The Machine
[feat. Ronnie Atkins][Music & lyrics by Tobias Sammet]

[Tobias Sammet]:
Home to the land of the living
Roused by a sound I confide
And what am I to cast my tired eyes upon
Where was I when the clock had been alive?

[Ronnie Atkins]:
I see marvel right in front of me
There's a man, who's got tomorrow in his hands
Don't you see what you are meant to be
Outside your cloud-cuckoo-land

[Tobias Sammet]:
Time won't wait for those who stay behind
To wait for time
In this tangible realms hesitation's a crime

[Chorus]
In the Night:
A secret mysterious dream
Dead of night, while the town lies asleep
We invoke the machine

[Ronnie Atkins]:
Those dreams that you
Hummed to yourself once
How far will you reach out
To make them come true

Will you turn around 
To shirk from duty
Or force the pace
While it's all up to you

[Tobias Sammet]:
A giant leap is to be made now
I'm struck with awe
We're gonna heed the inner call
My heart beat quicken
I behold the god-machine
I can't help but write history

As my glance wanders
To the far off end in the sky
Far off end end in the sky
Hissing and screaming, almost alive

In the night
My life came apart at the seams
Dead of the night, let's run up the wheel
We invoke the machine

In the Night:
A secret mysterious dream
Dead of night, the town lies asleep, whoa
We invoke the machine

In the night
Those in hiding are waiting for me
Dead of night, let's run up the wheel
We invoke the machine

8. What's Left Of Me
[Music & lyrics by Tobias Sammet]

I think of the days
I was thrilled by this road ahead
When the moment won over what was to come
Not afraid of the distance but the distance afraid of me
Everytime I made it there I found nothing
The distance was gone

Now, I don't wanna fade
But I ain't gonna run
I'm resting my head on these stones
God, what have you done to you and me
I'm tired of scaring the future away
No road ahead, the fire is dead
Father don't you see in front of you
Is what the chase has left of me

If only they told me
What the kerbside was hiding away
Where the angels from high street didn't want to go
And a heartbeat is forced
To resign to the glory of a commonplace
I am jaded

I don't wanna see what's becoming of me
Here's a bit! Then spare me this sight now…
Cut it out I'm tired of the future myself

I don't wanna fade but I ain't gonna run
I'm resting my head on these stones
God, what have you done to you and me
I'm tired of scaring the future away
No road ahead, the fire is dead
Father don't you see 
In front of you is what's left of me

God and glory torn to pieces,
No no, it's just the spirit of the times
I'm drawn to a flame that won't release me
Release me!
And I see a thousand who wait in line

I don't wanna face what I ain't gonna stand
I'm resting my head on these stones
God, what have you done 
Look at yourself! I'm tired of scaring the future away
The dark road ahead, the fire is dead
Father don't you see what you have made of me

9. Dweller In A Dream
[Music & lyrics by Tobias Sammet]

The dial by the night
Seems like what it used to be
But now that this town has fallen silent
I feel memories
Of good intentions ghosting me

Watch the tower clock hand
Cut instants off each hour
From a future that has been devoured
Already by their craving for the vague
And even after lucid heartbeats
Few and far between
We're back to gain admission to the wheel

Bending the boundaries
Deaf to the memories
We won't make in the rush anyway
And God if you'r out there
Why do you make me spin your wheel?

Do you hear me
Dweller I a dream

You're lost in the no-zone

A twilight mover
Primal screams

Are crying for the dweller in a dream

The study and a sage
And ancient brazen luminaire
Just a bat flap from answers they wanna hear
They're evident
To every cynic eminent

Movement around the sun
All in eternal time
The heaven's fires turned to light
The moon that governs birth and then decay
The principle decreed
By laws you think you will conceive
And then some accident 
To throw it all in place!?

Bending the boundaries
Don't run from your memories
I have been there before

Aroe you fro real now
Or just a dweller in my dream

Do you hear me
Dweller in a dream

You're lost in the no-zone

A twilight mover
Primal screams

Are crying for the dweller in a dream

Oh, why would your
God give road lead to ruin?
Why would science challenge facts?
Why would your
God given will come off the track?
Come of the track?
Dweller in a dream?

Father do you hear me
Dweller in a dream

You're lost in the no-zone

A twilight mover
Primal screams

Are crying for the
Dweller in a dream

Do you hear me
Dweller in a dream

10. The Great Mystery
[Music & lyrics by Tobias Sammet]

How could I let it get this far?
To the edge I've been drawn by promises
And what's the reason
For a heart to only misguide me
Blind me, tear myself apart?

When darkness falls and silence talks
At the edge of thoughts that you memorised
I'm the truth between the lines
They read and deny me and tie me to fantasy
And they'll curse this darkest hour
When in oblivion I'll die

Oh will you make me turn the page, one after another
If only you would make a mark the eye can see

You're dancing in around
Through the dark you long to find
Alight at the midnight t sky
To persuade the night

Don't leave me blind, give me one sign
Grant me just one look into the mystery behind
Fire and flames, heartache and pain:
You break me just to make me feel like a golden child
What if it's nothing but a dream
The great mystery, great mystery

We carry the flame to accelerate
The evolution of an age
Cast your eyes into the crystal ball - alright
We embrittle the weak that is0nt meant to be
We're gonna make it coronate the chosen ones
Who never sinned against their vocation

Don't be afraid: just look around
Don't question what your eyes can see

Don't leave me blind, give me one sign
Grant me just one look into the mystery behind
Fire and flames, heartache and pain:
Iv'e borne from my devotion

Oh she won't see me, she won't feel me
She's lost on her won, and so am I?

I see a cold moon rise above those empty streets
And I see movements part their lives
I hear the ticking leaving scars you can't conceal
Ain't it poignant how you try

Impatiently they're giving up on hearts
Whose signs they cannot read
As silence doesn't talk, eternity will cease

And as you marvel at the artwork in your hands
Rick in detail, so frail and beautiful
And you forget the rules
The elder's always made up for you
To save you precious time

You watch them pile up, they are saving on and on
Even you don't know where they store it all
You've got to be a fool if you don't save along
A thousand screaming
And silence doesn't speak to thousands screaming
No, silence doesn't wanna speak…

And I see tears shed over days when all was good
A child didn't care for what never really mattered

I see tears shed over days
When all was good and time
They had a lot to give away
When their hearts had eyes to see
And the final mystery
Was more than a fancy tale
And answers you did find
To dare what you would find inside, no

Don't leave me blind, give me one sign
Grant me just one look into the mystery behind
Fire and flames, heartache and pain: you break me just to make me feel like a golden child
Don't leave me blind, give me one sing
Grant me just one look into the mystery behind
Fire and flames, heartache and pain:
You break me just to make me feel like a golden child
Don't leave me blind, send a sing
Oh is it really not a dream?
The great mystery

11. The Cross And You
[Bonus Track]Screaming - in silence you must carry
your secrets down this lonely eerie wicked road
Screaming - you're oh so battle weary
They say it's lonely at the top
Let alone when you hit the ground

All ablaze - you're rushing down the tightrope
With your only mean companion ticking away

You gotta stand your ground
Forge into a fiery fierce tomorrow
Stand your ground
At the speed of light into the void
Hell is what you've gotta make it through
Until it's just the cross and you

The cross and you
The cross and you

Screaming from behind the mask of reason
The cautionary voice that shatters your brain
The silvery gleam of tomorrow
Keep accelerating in quest for a break
Until you realize that it's too late

All ablaze - you're rushing down the tightrope
With your only mean companion ticking away

You gotta stand your ground
Forge into a fiery fierce tomorrow
Stand your ground
At the speed of light into the void
Hell is what you've gotta make it through
Until it's just the cross and you

All ablaze I plough my way
Till I am allowed to fall
I pay my dues on a ship of fools
I kick and scream and fight and crawl

Get a life! Don't waste time!
As we drown the voice inside
Till the moment I awake
When it's just the cross and me

[Solo: Sascha Paeth]

You gotta stand your ground
Forge into a fiery fierce tomorrow
Stand your ground
At the speed of light into the void

You gotta stand your ground
Forge into a fiery fierce tomorrow
Stand your ground
At the speed of light into the void
Hell's the shortcut you're rushing through
Just the cross and you

12. Death Is Just A Feeling
[Bonus Track]Living in the darkness
What a cold and lonely night
Voices in the darkness
Sing a sweet sweet lullaby

Something's coming nearer
Anyone to join in game? A game
Welcome to the attic
Hospitality is my name

Eyes so alive
I've been feeling pretty dead
For quite a while
Gimme a smile

Dead-and-alive
Come a little closer
You and I:
Affiliates forevermore and I'm alive
Death is just a feeling
You and I swapping finitude
And love for diamonds
I'm just a little pale

Don't hesitate to sign right here
Don't be afraid to come with me
Specialized in temporizing
Dead to faulty love and time

Faulty time
We'll be dancing right here
Forever and a while
Day by day

Dead-and-alive
Come a little closer
You and I:
Affiliates forevermore and I'm alive
Death is just a feeling
You and I swapping finitude
And love for diamonds

Value by value
I'm gonna turn into breath after breath
Love we trade in for silver
Defy what they use to call death
And dust covered treasures will shine again
An unseen accolade
Larger than life, a memory
Death will be just a charade

Dead-and-alive
Come a little closer
You and I:
Affiliates forevermore and I'm alive
Death is just a feeling
You and I swapping finitude
And love for diamonds
I'm just a little pale

1. The Wicked Symphony
[Scarecrow]
You'll be running out of miracles
Like I'm running out of dreams
Madness lurking into my left
Angels faint in front of me

And I see eyes to the right
I hear a promise resound
Gold and diamonds, love and fame
And music meant to remain

[Inspiration]
You've been dying for glory
You've been looking for love
Why don't we read the signs
When we're about to get lost

[Mephistopheles]
A seeker enthralled by a flame
Eventually home to his pain
The Great Unbeloved
You reach for the final stage

[All]
Hey man in your hideaway
Where do we go from here
Heroes in the tragedy
Down-home just a memory
Where do we go
When the world gets in the way

Way down to the hide away
Afflatus divine! Your hands
And a wicked symphony
Hey now to the hideaway
Lock up the rain for a wicked symphony

[Mephistopheles]
Don't you give up on your emotions
Don't you abandon your despair
If you deny what you desire
This will have been just a mystery play

There'll be nowhere to go
Just oblivion, we're so close to reach out
Close to fall, make up or break up or crawl

[Inspiration]
You are striving for beauty
For a song to remain
A final touch and the spirit you have cited
Holds on to the reins

[Scarecrow]
I feel how I'm losing my ground
A dancer enthralled by a sound
The smoke clears away
I'll reach for the final stage

[All]
Hey man in your hideaway
Where do we go from here
Heroes in the tragedy
Down-home just a memory
Where do we go
When the world gets in the way

Way down to the hide away, afflatus Divine!
Your hands and a wicked symphony
Hey now to the hideaway
Lock up the rain for a wicked symphony

[Scarecrow]
Oh I can hear it, I can hear it
Oh I can hear it, I, I, I, I...
I can hear it, yeah
I'm dying for a sign

You can turn your face away
Can pretend you don't hear it
How long have you been begging on your knees
And now that you're near it
Won't you be damned if you defy what you're given
Mercury of salvation
The colors for the eyes of the world
We'll be kings for generations

[All]
Hey man in your hideaway
Where do we go from here
Heroes in the tragedy
Down-home just a memory
Where do we go
When the world gets in the way

Way down to the hide away
Afflatus divine!
Your hands and a wicked symphony
Hey now to the hideaway
Lock up the rain for a wicked symphony

2. Wastelands
[Mentor]
A moment of glory
The blink of an eye and it's all gone
You hide in confinement
Dark is the cell that you call home

We pretend to be blind
Every time it hurts to see

You - you close your eyes
To blink the night away
At ease in the wastelands
You - you're dead and blind
You sanctify the way
Blindfold in the wastelands

[Scarecrow]
Don't tell me in pain
The end doesn't justify the means
Spado, ascetic
It's easy to sermonize in jealousy

Now I'm off to life
I'm changing sides
Your final goodbye

You - you close your eyes
To blink the tears away
Love hurts in the wastelands
You - you're old and blind
You sacrifice it all
Lost in the wastelands

[Mentor]
You - you close your eyes
To blink the night away
At ease in the wastelands
You - you're dead and blind
You sanctify the way
Blindfold in the wastelands

3. Scales Of Justice
[Fury]
Predetermination, belief
Veracity of incidents
Reconciliation
Between justice and tomorrow
You're innocent

It's only human to just close your eyes
Blinding fury, part of paradise
Heaven justifies

[All]
To take your eyes off the drag
Walking to the block
At the scaffold scales held even
take your eyes off the drag
Walking to the block
Look away, scales held even

[Fury]
You owe the power and your pace
To the brute that's running after you
Humiliation's growing hate
Righteous anger driving you

[Scarecrow]
Cut off the hand
That tries to keep me back
Blinding fury, a piece of paradise
Cause heaven justifies

[All]
To take your eyes off the drag
Walking to the block
At the scaffold scales held even
To take your eyes off the drag
Walking to the block
Look away, scales held even

[Fury]
Just close your eyes, just look away
What you don't want to know
Ain't gonna hurt you
Time passes by, we all die anyway
And no, nothing remains
Whatever you say, whatever you do

[All]
To take your eyes off the drag
Walking to the block
At the scaffold scales held even
To take your eyes off the drag
Walking to the block
Look away, scales held even

4. Dying For An Angel
[Scarecrow]
You're awake in your darkest dream
I have come for you

[Future Scarecrow]
And nobody can hear you scream
When I reach for you

[Scarecrow]
Don't you remember their feet in your face
Before they have carved you in stone

[Future Scarecrow]
And don't you remember your sweat and your pain
When you were drawn to the bone
When you were left all alone

[All]
Living on a dream
Dying for an angel
Reach out, waiting for a miracle
No sign of wings, as you turn your back on me

Living on a dream
Lonely, cold and dire
Head up, feet down in the fire
Give until you're gone
Dying for an angel
Everyday

[Scarecrow]
Where do we go from the apogee
What do we leave behind
And how will I stand what I'll have to see
This reflection of mine

[Future Scarecrow]
Collateral damage, your sacrifice
Gotta learn to fly and learn to fall
Gonna tear down the walls of love and lies
You have come on your own
You will go on all alone

[All]
Living on a dream
Dying for an angel
Reach out, waiting for a miracle
No sign of wings, as you turn your back on me

Living on a dream
Lonely, cold and dire
Head up, feet down in the fire
Give until you're gone
Dying for an angel
Everyday

5. Blizzard On A Broken Mirror
[Acedia]
Faces in this empty room
Cited in despair
Gazes that I had invoked
They're driving me insane now
Walls have eyes, they're staring down on me
From everywhere around

[Scarecrow]
In the face of dreams I had
Grimaces of pain
Now I am turning helpless
Callous and alone
Waiting for a storm to brew
To wash my dream of love and sins away

[Acedia]
I'm with you
I'm the other side
You just gotta try
Fly now! No one's gonna care
Cause no one's gonna know
What no one's ever seen

[Scarecrow]
Close your eyes now
Kingdom on the broken mirror
Close your eyes now
Blizzard on the broken mirror
The scent of goodbye
They're dying away: the sands of time
Sands of time

[Acedia]
Fortune favors just the brave
That's what the blessed always say
Love will come in time
But I'm always late

I pray the wine my will to take
And those evil hands to tie
Wreaking havoc, baneful sight is growing dim

Tie the dream, I've had my fill
Raze the love and tie my will
Fires ploughing up my head
Oh forgive, I will forget

Lord, you're hiding in the haze?
The seventh door I'll try is daze
Angel send another storm to face another dawn

[Scarecrow]
Close your eyes now
Kingdom on the broken mirror
Close your eyes now
Blizzard on the broken mirror
The scent of goodbye
They're dying away: the sands of time

Close your eyes now
Kingdom on the broken mirror
Close your eyes now
Blizzard on the broken mirror
The scent of goodbye
They're dying away: the sands of time

6. Runaway Train
[Conscience]
Goodbye
Your pocket full of dreams
Your mind in a daze
Keep on chasing rainbows
Fly high
Leave the past behind
The dark road you take bears no escape

[Mephistopheles]
In a world of grand illusions
Where love is just a dream
You gotta make your sacrifices
Time to pick your poison

The fool is he who is noble-minded
And bellies up to poverty
He's not a king in the world of diamonds
Paling into oblivion

[Scarecrow]
I lay down my soul for glory
I've given a life away
Don't know if I am sorry
Blind me, blind me

Don't know where I'll be going
I gotta get away
From the pain of recollection
Drawn into the faint

[All]
Hang on to a runaway train
No turning back
Tethered to a runaway train
Take me away
Torpid in the wind and rain
No turning back
Hang on to a runaway train
Take me away

[Scarecrow]
If I'm a stranger to myself
Then I better gotta stay away
Even better gotta get away, get away
Time to pick my poison

Feel the devil sitting in my neck
Straight ahead into the unknown
Oh father I forgive you for I
Don't know what I'm doing

[Mephistopheles]
It's only human nature
To keep away from pain
Take a train to ecstasy oh
Ride on, ride on

Inhale the scent of heaven
Respire the smell of fame
You've been to hell and back
You can't change things anyway, no

[Scarecrow]
I hang on to a runaway train
No turning back
Tethered to a runaway train
Take me away
Torpid in the wind and rain
No turning back
I hang on to a runaway train
Take me away

[Mentor]
Reaching out to rule the world
you'll watch the mirror shatter
As you'll be dazzled by the sight
Once only diamonds mattered

How can you justify the way
When you wake up screaming
Will you pretend that you were blind
When you were really seeing

Your image everywhere
The looking glass: a sheet of ice
It's thick enough to dance on
In a frozen realm of lies

But the ice will break
And you will scream repenting
Oh boy, the ice will break
You'll just feel your heart rending

[Scarecrow]
Riding on to a world of funny flowers
Riding on to the white wide world
If coming back would hurt my pride
I'd rather take another ride
Riding on, winter on the mirror
Riding on into the unknown
If I'll awake in pain one day
I've gotta catch just one more train

[Conscience]
Days gone by
Who'd wanna live forever
On our knees up your road
Paved with good intentions
Fly high
Where angels can't breathe no more
Some dare to go blind
Some stay behind

[Scarecrow]
I hang on to a runaway train
No turning back
Tethered to a runaway train
Take me away
Torpid in the wind and rain
No turning back
I hang on to a runaway train
Take me away

Hang on to a runaway train
No turning back
Tethered to a runaway train
Take me away
Torpid in the wind and rain
in the wind and rain
I hang on to that runaway train

7. Crestfallen
[Scarecrow]
Ill-defined as I look in the mirror
Am I blind, am I blind
Am I given or just a straying fool
Feel it near
Something's here to watch

I feel their eyes sending shivers down my spine
Evil eyes, evil eyes
See me crawling as I'm falling off the edge
Paralyze, tantalize

Feel it there
From everywhere it sounds

And you'll fall away from heaven
Once you know you can't take no more of it
You will fall away from heaven
By the time you can see the crime against you

[Mephistopheles]
Hey - desperation
Angels crashing from the sky
How can you hold on to your way
In your mental disarray
I am your struggles
The answer to your pain
I am the fury in your eyes
I am reason, I am vice

It's there
From everywhere it sounds

[Scarecrow]
And you'll fall away from heaven
Once you know you can't take no more of it
You will fall away from heaven
By the time you can see the crime against you

And you'll fall away from heaven
Once you know you can't take no more of it
You will fall away from heaven
By the time you can see the crime against you

And you'll fall away from heaven
Once you know you can't take no more of it
You will fall away from heaven
By the time you can see the crime against you

8. Forever Is A Long Time
[Mephistopheles]
Young is the day
Still it's the same
The same old tomorrow
Colors too bright
So dream in black and white
If you wanna rise from the hollow

The future in sight
The past in your head
Nightmare or treason
The father above you as you
Walk through the ashes
Don't you run out of reason

You keep on waiting
For your choice to be made
There ain't no bounty
For the number of passions
You rein in for love

You are defying the devil
Forever this time
But you can't imagine
Forever will drag on a long long time
You are defying salvation
The wait is your crime
Stalemate in virtue, we falter
Forever's a long time

[Scarecrow]
Pleasure and pain feel all the same
To the dreamer who's trying to get closer
Strange how it feels in reality
When your fairy tale's over

No right or wrong
I just keep going on
And I don't get lost in belief

Falter and pray
Keep looking away
I don't wanna see

We keep on waiting
For a choice to be made
There ain't no bounty for the passion
We rein in for love

[Mephistopheles]
You are defying the devil
Forever this time
But you can't imagine
Forever will drag on a long long time
You are defying salvation
The wait is your crime
Stalemate in virtue, we falter
Forever's a long time
Forever is a long time
It's gonna take forever

Oh - young is the day
Still it's the same
The same old tomorrow
Colors too bright
So dream in black and white
Wanna rise from the hollow
You are defying the devil
Forever this time
But you can't imagine
Forever will drag on a long long time
You are defying salvation
The wait is your crime
Stalemate in virtue, we falter
Forever's a long time

9. Black Wings
[Shelter]
I've been here through a million ages
I am the savior inside
Tonight I am love and justice
Tomorrow perversion to spite

And now that it's bleeding you dry
I'm calling you, I'm calling you
When temperance is bleeding you dry
I'm knocking you off the perch

[Scarecrow]
And out in the rain
I'll hide under wings I'd curse in sunlight
Out in the rain
You can break me and take me away
On wings of fury

[Shelter]
Live your tragic comedy
I'm the poison in your veins
Circumspection, vanity
You give all they can take

I am fury, I am fire, I'm the worm inside
Deliver you from self-denial tonight
When temperance is bleeding you dry, I'm inside

[Scarecrow]
And out in the rain

I'll hide under wings I'd curse in sunlight
Out in the rain
You can break me and take me away
On wings of fury

[Shelter]
Who do you think you are
To tell me what to say
Who do you think you are
To tell me what to play
What not to break
When temperance is bleeding you dry, I'm inside

[Scarecrow]
And out in the rain
I'll hide under wings I'd curse in sunlight
Out in the rain
You can break me and take me away
On wings of fury

10. States Of Matter
[Inspiration]
Your mind to infinity
Let reason rivet on your feet or you may fall
You're drawn into a distant glow
You dream of voices from on high
But can't evade another rainy night
And putting on another show
Hate and affection
Pleasure and pain
Modes of vibration
Unveiling to be all the same

And when the final day has come
It's another state of matter
And when you face another sun
It's the union of the states of matter

[Scarecrow]
Failure and defeat and all the riches surely beat
Where I have been and what I have been before
And when the sands of time run low
Commemoration of a lonely crow
That would have made it through the door

Light and affection
Darkness and pain
Mind over matter
The all's gonna make it all the same

And when the final day has come
It's another state of matter
When you will face another sun
It's the union of the states of matter

[Inspiration]
Light and affection
Darkness and pain
Mind over matter
The all's gonna make it all the same

And when the final day has come
It's another state of matter
When you will face another sun
It's the union of the states of matter

11. The Edge
[Scarecrow]
When I was sent to walk this long cold way
I'd never meant to take it all this far
Nobody told me I was bound to stray
You gave me visions and cut out this part

When the journey is over
Then what will remain
But a churchyard of angels

Don't need no glory
The bottle and I
Don't need no sympathy at all
As I hang on the edge

Don't need no glory
Till the river's run dry
I won't cry for sympathy as I
Hang on the edge

When your were shackles chances passed me by
I've broken free
Now I'm free falling
Laid down my arms as you laid down the lie:
Those words you didn't say when I was calling

Fingers bleed onto the ivory
They dance on the keys
To a churchyard of angels

Don't need no glory
The bottle and I
Don't need no sympathy at all
As I hang on the edge

Don't need no glory
Till the river's run dry
I won't cry for sympathy as I
Hang on the edge

Don't need no glory
The bottle and I
Don't need your sympathy at all
As I hang on the edge

Don't need no glory
Till the river's run dry
I won't cry for sympathy as I
Hang on the edge

Don't need no glory
The bottle and I
I don't need your sympathy at all
As I hang on the edge

Don't need no glory
The bottle and I
I don't need your sympathy at all
As I hang on the edge

1. Mystery Of A Blood Red Rose
[Lead vocals: Tobias]
[Lead guitar: Sascha Paeth]

We've played our roles in our passion plays
They've imposed on us right from the cradle
No matter what you dream, beware of what you say
Until the cogwheel's out of control to burst out of place

No time to breathe, don't have no time to waste
Bring on the night, seize every drop of life away

Slice a tasty hour off from (or in a blink it will be gone)
A stranding future bring it on

Mystery of a blood-red rose
Burning like a raging fire
When the day's been torn apart we'll leave it behind
Mystery of a blood-red rose
Feasting on a blind desire
Let the scent of poisonous flowers tempt me away

A sweet temptation and a pure red rose
While the hour don't wait for a blink to cram the past
I'll get a move on
No hesitation makes no one a better man
I can't wait to finally know now what is gonna show now in

Mystery of a blood-red rose
Burning like a raging fire
When the day's been torn apart we'll leave it behind
Mystery of a blood-red rose
Future glowing on a pyre
Let the scent of a poisonous rose tempt me away

Boy, reach out for what is due
Or you'll lap up what's left for you
Throw ourselves into the waves
And as the grinding wheel of time
Is grinding out the chimes
To echo in the night

We're off into the moonshine

Mystery of a blood-red rose
Burning like a raging fire
When the day's been torn apart we'll leave it behind
Mystery of a blood-red rose
Future glowing on a pyre
Let the scent of a poisonous rose tempt me away

And I will waste no time tonight
And I don't waste no time at all tonight

2. Let The Storm Descend Upon You
[Lead vocals: Tobias, Jorn Lande, Ronnie Atkins, Robert Mason (Warrant)]
[Lead guitar: Oliver Hartmann]

I'm smothered by your lucid nothing
I can't hear and touch and see
But I feel it
Though I can't believe it
Like master of the observation
Coming up with an explanation
There's no need
Making use of the spirit

We can give you answers you are dying to receive
Keep on dreaming
Keep on screaming
yeah
You might be getting too much for your beating hart to take
Your flesh is malice
Prepare your chalice

Lights
breathe and sleep tight
Will you defy intriguing ghostlights
Seeing through all lies and foolish warnings

There ain't no return

Never like the darkness
It may burn your soul away
As you've been seeing
What you've though you're dreaming

Never open doors if you don't dare to walk on through
Maybe you're old
Now it's all your fault

Light
You're off to the light
Will you defy all evil ghostlights
Tell the truth from depuration
Time
Don't waste no time
Prevail against the hands that tick your flesh away
Now delve into your own reflection

Oh, in all that where I've been to
There's nothing but a void over the sanity of fools

Shine your light into the darkness
And let the storm descend upon you
And I will make you mine
Shine your light into the darkness
Behold the lead Aurora fall upon you
Oh, let the storm descend upon you

Journey to the other side
It's just a trip and pleasure ride
And I don't know
But does it really matter?

I am he who's always been
Who dares to know what can't be seen
I'm illusion or truth
I'm confusion

Light
Bring me the light
I will bring out certainty on a silver plate
Like a mantle piece
I will wipe out darkness

Night,
Blessed is the night
'Til there's no time left to spill
To save and kill
To take and seize
'Til this trip's your law

Obey reflections of some crazy dream
Or maybe the backside of reality

Shine your light into the darkness
And let the storm descend upon you
And I will make you mine
Shine your light into the darkness
Behold the lead Aurora fall upon you
Let the storm descend upon you

You gotta pray you're gunning just a ghostlight
You gotta be won't be falling down the wayside
Let it carry you away

Cut the gem until it's purified away
The candle burning to the ground
I don't see nothing but addiction to the rhyme
Kindles everything around

For all the world we'll see it tower to the stars
And all is melting into one

We give them something to fall back on every time
They're too strung out to run

Every moment, every heartbeat, every breath
Leaves you one less to your last

Still you cherish every second of the game
Give me the future, you take the past

And what if God is just an image in the mind
A reflection of the will

And what's the valor when the law you live in harmony
Falls second for the drill

I pray the lord ain't just a ghostlight in my mind
a reflection of the will
Let the storm descend upon me
Let Aurora fall upon me

Let the fire fall upon him
Let the fire purify him
Never judge a thing you see
It's only what your mortal eyes will want it to be
Oh, bring it on
Let the dark and heaven confusion
Spit out a conclusion

Obey reflections of a memory
Are just reflections in a crazy dream

Shine your light into the darkness
And let the storm descend upon you
And I will make you mine
Shine your light into the darkness
Behold the lead Aurora fall upon you
Shine your light into the darkness (through the darkness)
And let the storm descend upon you

And I will make you mine
Shine your light into the darkness (into the darkness)
Behold the lead Aurora fall upon you
Oh, let the storm descend upon you (let the storm descend upon you)
Oh, descend upon you, yeah

3. The Haunting
[Lead vocals: Dee Snider, Tobias]
[Lead guitar: Sascha Paeth]

I can't count the days I've days I've roamed
A stray ghost liked to wither on the vine
A paling tales of days long gone
I won't be until you close your eyes

Sleep time
Someone's always by your side

A thousand nights we've been calling your name
Close your eyes but I won't go away
We're there for you
The cold embrace that you don't wanna feel
Must not be but you know it is real
We're there for you

Don't you waste your time and try
To understand this figment of the lie

Don't breathe the word to anyone
By the time you phrase me I'll be gone

Sweet dreams
See you in the twilight zone

A thousand nights we've been calling your name
Close your eyes but I won't go away
We're there for you
The cold embrace that you don't wanna feel
Must not be but you know it is real
We're there for you

Down I must contain the wayward fantasy
Where did all those wicked dreams come from
Pictures in the dark they seem so eerily
Winter night, I pray my mind is wrong

I'm the spot they refuse to conceive

A thousand nights we've been calling your name
Close your eyes but I won't go away
We're there for you
The cold embrace that you don't wanna feel
Must not be but you know it is real
We're there for you

4. Seduction Of Decay
[Lead vocals: Geoff Tate, Tobias]
[Lead guitar: Sascha Paeth]

It ain't the far cry that it seemed
In just a wink we'd come for you
You may not feel it
We are the light, the scorching heat
We are the untold chosen few
And now we've come for you

We'll fit you like a velvet glove that's gonna choke their minds
Affiliate yourself with what you can't defy
Some below and few above
We're gonna numb their minds

Riot on the edge
On the brink of insanity
Riot on the edge

You'll hear me screaming your name
I am the angel of decay to seize you
There'll be no thoughts to maintain
I am the seduction of decay

I hear their tales reverberate
From shrouds of myth that only time would weave
Bred in a den of lunacy
Who can we trust? Who's next in line?
The sacred drive to rationalize
Commit ourselves another day to the lesser crime
Choke on your own pace with candour
So pleasant in the quiet
Vicegerents of the tide

Riot on the edge
On the brink of insanity
Riot on the edge

You'll hear me screaming your name
I am the angel of decay to seize you
There'll be no thoughts to maintain
I'm the seduction of decay

Time contaminating space to reinfect and agonize anything around
We are metabolite of dreams
The chosen ones to sacrifice the wasteland-bound

Oh, Euphoria is looming in the darkness
Coincidence of opposites we are
Once beautiful intentions

Oh, we'll drag you over
Oh, it's gonna drag you over

Oh, from the start we run away
And don't seem to care what for
Forever feels just like a blink after passing by
Just fools don't know the prime's another state of decay

Riot on the edge
On the brink of insanity
Riot on the edge

You'll hear me screaming your name
I am the angel of decay to seize you
There'll be no thoughts to maintain
I'm the seduction of decay

5. Ghostlights
[Music & Lyrics: Tobias Sammet]
[Lead vocals: Michael Kiske, Tobias, Jorn Lande]
[Lead guitar: Sascha Paeth, Oliver Hartmann]

[Mystic:]
You're tossing and turning
You think you're awake while you're trying to run
Like in a nightmare
Time loves your ego to death
You're leaving the wheelwork to the ground of being
You go on
Defying temptation in the engine room that is ourselves

[Aaron:]
I feel a storm is looming with a shaking grumble
I don't know if I'm right or wrong
I don't know if I shall go on
I don't know what I'll believe but I'm on my way

[Mystic:]
Minds fly free when the gates fly open
Walk on through

[Aaron:]
Thunder and rain and the wind in my face

[Mystic:]
Ghostlights dance will you heed the token
Glazing light

[Aaron:]
Blinding my eyes get me out of this maze

The world as we know it is beginning to shake
I don't trust my eyes are we all superstitious
If we think what our hearts know is true
Fireworks surround me
Wherever I go they tell me: always home
Psycho-somatic they'll name it the nature of god

[Mystic:]
Off to a new horizon
Time is the key to unite with the all
Time is gonna make you see right from wrong eternally
Don't let the noises devour you

[Mystic:]
Minds fly free when the gates fly open
Walk on through

[Aaron:]
Thunder and rain and the wind in my face

[Mystic:]
Ghostlights dance will you heed the token
Glazing light

[Aaron:]
Blinding my eyes get me out of this maze

[Solo: Sascha Paeth & Oliver Haartmann]

[Temptation:]
And what if you're only a prism for the ghostlights that you wanna see
And we're just reflections of your dreams

[Aaron:]
It's speaking to me
It's yelling at me
It's screaming to me, resonating with me
And a thousand lights are trying to make me see
They call me home

[Mystic:]
Minds fly free when the gates fly open
Walk on through

[Aaron:]
Thunder and rain and the wind in my face

[Mystic:]
Ghostlights dance will you heed the token
Glazing light

[Aaron:]
Blinding my eyes get me out of this maze

6. Draconian Love
[Lead vocals: Herbie Langhans (Sinbreed), Tobias]
[Lead guitar: Sascha Paeth]

[2x]
You shed draconian love
You shed draconian...

Welcome to your way
Seemingly endless as you take your wings
The world through kaleidoscope eyes
Until you unlearn what you keep inside

Those innocent eyes...
Refracting the light for an innocent soul
Till the cold around's not gonna wait its turn
Wait its turn no more

[Pre-chorus:]
Tell me how should I embrace?
Like roses we'll wither on the vine
Why should I bide my time
If it flies away sometime?

[Chorus:]
Where are you now, where are you now?
Leaving me down here lost in the waves
Hey, hey, hey
When will God explain this draconian love?
You shed draconian love, you shed draconian love
Where do I go? Where are you now?
Selling me love through the fiery rain, angel
When will you explain this draconian love?
It's all draconian love, it's all draconian

Infiltrate us with mercy
Bait us with sympathy
Blind us with love
We're lost in the clouds rolling by
What some of us read into what they feel

Like a grain of nothing
I feel cast in the wind of enthean caprice
Of an unbred cause,
Of an unborn will
Whatever that may mean

[Pre-chorus:]
Tell me how should I embrace?
Like roses we'll wither on the vine
Tell me why should I bide my time?
If it flies away sometime

[Chorus:]
Where are you now, where are you now?
Leaving me down here lost in the waves
Hey, hey, hey
When will God explain this draconian love?
You shed draconian love, you shed draconian love
Where do I go? Where are you now?
Selling me love through fiery rain, angel
When will you explain this draconian love?
It's all draconian love, it's all draconian

Aspiration and tears,
Heartache and fears
Draconian love, you shed draconian love
Unrequited love – down on my knees
Draconian love, it's all draconian

Where are you now, where are you now?
Leaving me down here lost in the waves
Will you explain this draconian love?

[Chorus:]
Where are you now, where are you now?
Leaving me down here lost in the waves
Hey, hey, hey
When will God explain this draconian love?
You shed draconian love, you shed draconian love
Where do I go? Where are you now?
Selling me love through fiery rain
Hey, hey, hey
Will you explain this draconian love?
It's all draconian love, it's all draconian

Where are you now, where are you now?
Leaving me down here lost in the waves
When will God explain this draconian love?
You she draconian love, you shed draconian love
Where do I go? Where are you now?
Selling me love through fiery rain...

7. Master Of The Pendulum
[Lead vocals: Marco Hietala, Tobias]
[Lead guitar: Sascha Paeth]

[Aaron:]
Who's the one who's stretching out his hand
Is it it or is it me that won't lose hold
Take on to the pendulum and sway
Like a mistletoe I'm clinging to the cold, yeah

[Watchmaker:]
I am the trellis for those in need to twine around
The rock of ages for those who're meant to wander around
I got no time for a break and we got no time to waste
I'll save it up in the pace, I'll quantify thoughts away
That you don't need anyway, oh what a beautiful day...

[Aaron:]
Tic toc tic toc
Someone's watching over me

[Watchmaker:]
Begging for a dance
While your sands are running out
Rigid and firm's what I hold in my hands
Tick away time, I allot and I divide
Master of the hands that guide you
Run if you can while the war drum's ticking on
Ancient of days, I'm the shouldering pace
I will make you mine, I allot and I divide
Master of the hands that push you

That's who I am.
The master of these hands

I lead the horse to the water and I make it drink
I'm here to force precision just on everything

[Aaron:]
I feel your breath in my neck
I feel you behind my back
And as I'm turning around
There's just this frightening sound
I feel it everywhere
Oh I know that you're there...

Tic toc tic toc
Someone's watching over me

Begging for a dance while your sands are running out
Rigid and firm's what you hold in your hands
Tick away time, you allot and you divide
Master of the hands that guide you

Run if you can while the war drum's ticking on
Ancient of days: you're the shouldering pace

[Watchmaker:]
I will make you mine, I allot and I divide
Master of the hands that push you

[Aaron:]
Angels fall
Time's gonna winnow all
Dying dreams
Right from wrong
Dwell in a run
Turn the wheel
Something's reaching out for me

[Watchmaker:]
Begging for a dance
While your sands are running out
Rigid and firm's what I hold in my hands
Tick away time, I allot and I divide
Master of the hands that guide you

Run if you can while the war drum's ticking on
Ancient of days, I'm the shouldering pace
I will make you mine, I allot and I divide
Master of the hands that push you

8. Isle Of Evermore
[Lead vocals: Sharon Den Adel, Tobias]

[Muse:]
From a frozen world will you take me over
All alone, sweet embrace
Leave the place I can't abide no more

[Aaron:]
Take a look at ourselves, afraid to get closer
Will the predetermination drive us to a distant shore

[Muse:]
The tender velvet gown of destination left behind

[Both:]
I'm wide awake, I'm on my way to evermore
[Muse:]
And I turn around to fading shores
I'll sail on through this opening door
[Both:]
Wide awake onto the isle of evermore
[Muse:]
I'm dead to the world, you blindfold my eyes
While you're killing what I'm yearning for

[Muse:]
You just see what your eyes have been told to tell you
Falling down to the ground, how come you ask if what you feel is true

[Aaron:]
I'm staring at the maze and let it paralyze me
Watch it come alive and burn me out until I'm coming through
The tender velvet gown of slumber will just leave me just breathing

[Both:]
Wide awake I'm on my way to evermore
[Muse:]
And I turn around to fading shores
I'll sail on through this opening door
[Both:]
Wide awake onto the isle of evermore
I'm dead to the world
You blindfold my eyes
[Muse:]
While you're killing what I'm yearning for
What I'm yearning for...

[Both:]
Wide awake I'm on my way to evermore
[Aaron:]
And I turn around to fading shores
[Both:]
I'll sail on through this opening door
Wide awake onto the isle of evermore
I'm dead to the world blindfold my eyes
While you're killing what I'm yearning for

9. Babylon Vampyres
[Lead vocals: Tobias, Robert Mason (Warrant)]
[Lead guitar: Bruce Kulick, Oliver Hartmann, Sascha Paeth]

[Aaron:]
A lot of good advice
Nobody's keeping for themselves
If you're playing by the rules
You'll be a trophy on a shelf
Give in to the ordinary run of things
Like it is meant to be
There's nothing left of me

[Scientist I:]
Praying for salvation, floating with the tide
The very first temptation
Drags you to the other side
You learn to walk and run
You fly until you fall as far as I can see

[Aaron:]
The future ahead was not what it used to be

[Scientist I:]
Blessed was the darkness - veiling hypocrisy

[Scientist I:]
Babylon is burning, shining from afar
Babylon is burning

[Aaron:]
From sunset to sunrise

[Scientist I:]
Babylon is burning
And you're glowing like a fiery star
And no one can tell if we've been for real

Babylon is burning
Babylon is burning

They say it's coming by the night
To engraft into the brain
What a scientific tongue won't recall
Or even phrase
It's crawling up your spine
To breed a wicked freak of nature
We will be a new society

[Aaron:]
Headless congregation, a vortex needing more

[Scientist I:]
The road to good intentions is evil to the core

[Aaron:]
The devil and the deep blue sea are waiting
Side by side for me

[Aaron:]
The sweet scent of poison
Hazing the dread away
This side of the moon I'll confess to... another day

[Scientist I:]
Babylon is burning, shining from afar

[Aaron:]
Babylon is burning
From sunset to sunrise

[Scientist I:]
Babylon is burning
And you're glowing like a fiery star
And no one can tell if we've been for real
Yeah

[Scientist I:]
Ever since I can remember
I've been shooting up that road with a dream
I saw gold at the end of the rainbow
I was given an idea of what life should be
What life should be

[Aaron:]
Ain't there a light above the shadow
Ain't there blood in the machine
Ain't there flesh they'd been misleading
Ain't there a longing soul within?

[Scientist I:]
I've seen believers on the wayside
And I'm afraid to say, I think just like you
That failed to pretend
They could cope with what they'd find
When they didn't have a clue - just like you
Babylon is burning, shining from afar

[Aaron:]
Babylon is burning
From sunset to sunrise

[Scientist I:]
Babylon is burning
And you're glowing like a fiery star
And no one can tell if we've been for real, oh
Babylon is burning, shining from afar

[Aaron:]
Babylon is burning
From sunset to sunrise

[Scientist I:]
Babylon is burning
And you're glowing like a fiery star
And no one can tell if we've been for real

10. Lucifer
[Lead vocals: Jorn Lande, Tobias]
[Lead guitar: Bruce Kulick]

Eternities ago I must have fallen
Through my pride been perfect in my ways
The Morning star they fired down from heaven
Envy wrapped into a gown of grace

I hear the screams that echo from the darkness
I swerve from dawn to dusk and off the edge
Oh hear the creature crying in the distance
Buried in the symbol on a shelf

I'll take you home tonight to center of your soul
I'll take you home tonight. Fire, flesh and blood
Touching the flames tonight,
Touching the flames tonight

Morning star, embrace me on this grounds, angel of light

[Guitar solo]

How will I forgive him who wouldn't forgive me who just value the power?
How should I live in peace with the one, outshining me and then have me devoured?

I'm feeling alive under the skies.
Blood-shot's the moon and scarlet's the night
I'll make you fume in fury and rage.
I'll make you see what you're made of tonight

I'll take you home tonight to center of your soul
I'll take you home tonight. Fire, flesh and blood
Touching the flames tonight,
Touching the flames tonight
Touching the flames tonight,
Touching the flames tonight

11. Unchain The Light
[Lead vocals: Tobias, Ronnie Atkins, Michael Kiske]
[Lead guitar: Sascha Paeth, Oliver Hartmann]

[Aaron:]
Who's got the answer
Is this what I'm looking for
And who do I talk to
What do I have to explore

[Magician:]
Attend to your god given duty
You'll be taking your heaven by force
How could you choose
With your head in the noose
With no time to lose

[Mystic:]
High up in the open skies

[Magician:]
We'll chain the light
We'll take the time from those it does to death, we're

[Mystic:]
High up in the open skies

[Aaron:]
We'll chain the light
We'll take the time from those it does to death and I'll chain the light
I'll bring it right down to illuminate unholy ways, we'll chain the light

[Magician:]
Too worn out to wonder
We might not want to overextend them no more
Our beautiful spook lights are all they will need
All they will want to explore

[Aaron:]
And after it's all said and done
We won't fear the transience no more
'Cause we don't realize
Idle glance in our eyes
Let precision prevail

[Mystic:]
High up in the open skies

[Magician:]
We'll chain the light
We'll take the time from those it does to death,
We're

[Mystic:]
High up in the open skies

[Aaron:]
We'll chain the light
We'll take the time from those it does to death and I'll chain the light
I'll bring it right down to illuminate unholy way, we'll chain the light

[Mystic:]
You look above
To see inside yourself
And find time standing still
You see the world in different light
You turn this moment
Into what you think it's ought to be
Demystify the dark

[Mystic:]
High up in the open skies

[Magician:]
We'll chain the light
We'll take the time from those it does to death,
We're

[Mystic:]
High up in the open skies

[Aaron:]
We'll chain the light
We'll take the time from those it does to death and I'll chain the light
I'll bring it right down to illuminate unholy ways

12. A Restless Heart And Obsidian Skies
[Lead vocals: Bob Catley, Tobias]
[Lead guitar: Bruce Kulick]

[Spirit:]
A genuine soul to dwell on baleful grounds
Glances wandering around
In the darkness of the world
Clouds have closed a ring around the sky
While the old ones hear the chimes
Through the darkness of the world

A genuine man will realize
He must fawn upon the times
While he shouldn't waste a word
Tender feet on stony ground
See the young ones stray around
Through the darkness of the world

[Aaron:]
Sacred heart will you usher me now
For I'll carry the lantern your way
For I'll bring us home

[Spirit:]
Dark is the night, scarlet the moon
Sacred the light in the haze reflecting within

[Aaron:]
Blazing the trail

Be still my restless heart
Obsidian's the sky
Inward you look as you halt

[Spirit:]
Be still restless heart

[Aaron:]
I'm on my way

[Spirit:]
Under obsidian skies

[Aaron:]
Wake to the sound of passing time
How could I quantify it in the darkness of the world
Wake to the shadow of a dream
Nothing's what it seems
As you brave the darkness of the world

[Spirit:]
Ghost lights and matter
You'll know what is real
Perception and fact - all the same
Truth's what you feel

[Spirit:]
Dark is the night, scarlet the moon
Sacred the light in the haze reflecting within

[Aaron:]
Blazing the trail

Be still my restless heart
Obsidian's the sky
Inward you look as you halt

[Spirit:]
Be still restless heart

[Aaron:]
I'm on my way
Under obsidian skies

[Spirit:]
And the wind and the rain that were shaking the pane
Move onward along with the clouds
And you're gazing in awe at the ghost lights above
As if stars cut their way through the shroud
On and on and on...

[Spirit:]
Moon shines
Ghost lights
Oh they reach out for you
Blazing the trail under obsidian skies

[Aaron:]
Dark is the night, scarlet the moon
Sacred the light in the haze reflecting within
Blazing the trail

Be still my restless heart

[Spirit:]
Obsidian's the sky
Inward you look as you halt
Be still restless heart

[Aaron:] I'm on my way

[Aaron:]
Dark is the night, scarlet the moon
Sacred the light in the haze reflecting within
Blazing the trail
Be still my restless heart

[Spirit:]
Obsidian's the sky
Inward you look as you halt
Be still restless heart

[Aaron:] I'm on my way

13. Wake Up To The Moon
You see the sun touch the horizon
You know the future awaits
And yours hides in the darkness

The stars are gonna line up in the night sky
I see what some will deny
As I follow the starkness

Can you believe your eyes
We'll make you rise to the occasion
Follow your heart and run
Seek shelter from the day

Waiting for the moon
The sound of falling angels calling you
Strange and magic
Hear us call your name

Darkness shines a sweet
deceleration down on you

Wayward child wake up to the moon

They wanna squeeze you in their picture from the outside
they call your life a world of make-believe

You're feeling pushed by a racing heartbeat
Parameterizing the world
They only see what they're told to see

Child of the ocean floor
No need of daylight that deceives you
Don't let them wear you down
Listen to the voice

Waiting for the moon
The sound of falling angels calling you

Strange and magic
Hear us call your name

Darkness shines a sweet
deceleration down on you
Wayward child wake up to the moon

Kind of buried alive
You've been sacrificed
They show you the key
Till you love to agree
A brave modern day
This world is insane

Waiting for the moon
The sound of falling angels calling you
Strange and magic

Hear us call your name
Darkness shines a sweet
deceleration down on you
Wayward child wake up to the moon
Waiting for the moon
The sound of falling angels calling you
Strange and magic
Hear us call your name
Darkness shines a sweet
deceleration down on you
Wayward child wake up to the moon

1. Halloween
[3:22]

Years ago I came back.
This'll be my hardest attack.
Burning fire in my brain.
I can feel the deadly flame.

You'll never make it, your blood I suck.
Your fire's burning round my neck.
Celebration, let the day.

Hunting me down, there's no escape.
There's no way out, but trying to escape.
You're just insane, can't catch me.

Halloween, I'm sent to hear his voice on Halloween.
Halloween, can feel the Kiss of Death on Halloween.

When you feel the Kiss of Death,
there's nothing you can do.
An angel sent me to destroy and kill.
Yeah.

You see the X, but it's too late.
It's in your head and you are dead.
There's no way out, they tell us.

Can feel the Kiss of Death.
There's nothing in my head but blood.

Halloween, I'm sent to hear his voice on Halloween.
Halloween, can feel the Kiss of Death on Halloween.

[Guitar solo]

This gaining dawn I feel.
Just tell me how this is real.
Is it the end of me and you?
Can feel the Kiss of Death.
There's nothing in my head but blood.

Halloween, I'm sent to hear his voice on Halloween.
Halloween, can feel the Kiss of Death on Halloween.
Halloween, I'm sent to hear his voice on Halloween.

2. Brian
[2:41]

When the sky is burning,
see the Moon falling down.
On your right is lightning.
See the war in the sky.

Remember Brian,
when it's time.
Remember Brian.

[Guitar solo]

All our empty heads
discover the war in the sky.
Don't need no revolution
by the birthday of Brian.

Remember Brian,
when it's time.
Remember Brian.

When the end is nearing,
see him hanging on the cross.
A war in the sky
now by the ending of Brian.

Remember Brian,
when it's time.
Remember Brian.

3. Dead Of The Night
[3:33]

Every night I hear thunder.
The shadow, can't you see?
So one night I will follow.
The dark side reigns in me.

(He) leads me to the dark plains.
The end is near, I feel.
But (I've) never seen his damned face.
My hearts pound hard in fear.

Dead of the night, take me away.
Dead of the night, he's looking for you.

A hundred solemn faces,
they look at me and laugh.
But if one wants to touch them,
they glow through nothingness.

If I come to tell you,
you look at me and laugh.
I never found the doctor,
so one day I'll be mad.

In that night I follow.
No pain, no work, no more.
He leads me on through the dark realm.
My sense grows far too dense.

[Guitar solo]

Dead of the night, take me away.
Dead of the night, he's looking for you.

They will not take me easy.
No love will come through death.
I take them on and kill myself.
And just feel emptiness.

Now you see them rising,
but no one knows but me.
So, don't try (to) follow a demon
and wait for a last attack.

In that night I follow.
No pain, no work, no more.
He leads me on through the dark realm.
My sense grows far too dense.

Dead of the night, take me away.
Dead of the night, he's looking for you.
Dead of the night.

4. Symphonies Of Doom
[4:08]

[Hansi:]
In the dark night (they) defend their missiles,
where it's the night we all die.
Enthralling power, who searches to be masters.
They play their game with your life.
The burning fire comes around, the heat is on
Just for this day, it's all sad blues.

[Marcus:]
The East Sun is burning hard.
See, your life is short.
See the rainbow in the mirror.
See the rainbow in the sky.
See the desert in front of you.
See the desert of life.

Standing in the cold rain, waiting for the end.
See the shadows of the night.
I have told you, but now it is too late.
These are Symphonies of Doom.

[Hansi:]
Feel the danger, this final battle.
It will imply us all God's agony.
The endless blitzes just blind your eyes shut
And blow your life out to nothingness.
Black shadows storming in the East, but you can't see.
The liec has set that power free.

[Guitar solo]

[Marcus:]
The East Sun is burning hard.
See, the life is short.
See the rainbow in the mirror.
See the rainbow in the sky.
See the desert in front of you.
See the desert of life.

I'm no sinner. I'm no fool.
I have heard these chants before.
I have told you, but now it is too late.
These are Symphonies of Doom.

5. Lucifer's Heritage

1. Inquisition
[instrumental]

2. Banish From Sanctuary
In deserts I was preaching
The hand of god was with me
Baptized with water and I praised
The one who came behind me
To save us all with the holy ghost
A prophet of the fools I've been lost

I'm sure you're there wandering around
But do you care for me I'm alone
You talk of love not for me
In my dungeon cold I could think about
All the things you've said
But I can't understand your famous son

[Lead: Andre]

I left the way of heaven or did you leave me from it?

[Ref.:]
No, no, turning back
I'm banished from sanctuary
The darkness in me is filling me with pain
There's no way to turn back for eternity

In shadows I'm walking and caught in loneliness
Deliverance I wait for but how long?
Are you the one who should come show me the light in you
Or should we wait for someone? Another!

[Ref.]

[Solo: Andre / Lead: Marcus / Andre]

Your Reich should come to this world
Your way smoothed by my blood, friend
My might will decrease but you'll get
High, yes so much higher be careful of the rats, friend
'Cause they'll never sleep before they catch you, too

The blind can see the sun,
cripples walk alone
The deaf can hear my words
they believe, just believe
They believe in me.
Look! The signs are near
To perform my task, to perform my way
To perform the way I walked
The way of the crucifix

[Lead: Andre]

I hear the hangman coming, I wait for execution

[Ref.]

3. Damned For All Time
[Lead:Andre]
Conquer the whole world to satisfy
Their lust for pain and terror
Disguise their faces to hide them
In the dark Determination

The oath on the runestaff is the highest
The ruin of a nation Step by step Destiny
[Lead:Andre]

Damned for all time - but what's time
Tales of the one who's born to change

And as the earth was old and cold
She closed her eyes and fell to sleep
Violation ruled the world
The dark kingdom's time

He's called Hawkmoon wearing a sign
Black jewel in his head
He's the one who's forever there
He's born a thousand times

[Ref:]
Damned for all time In every age he existed
Damned for all time In every future he'll live
For all time He's crying He's crying

Hey strange one I know you're standing there
The faces are they mine?
Are you out there?
Watch out for the day, friend I'll know your name
Hear my laughter

Oblivion - who's blowing the horn
Oblivion - who's killing the gods

[Ref:] Damned...
[Solo:Andre]

Dark kingdom's lost now. No pain storms the land
Strange things are happening. Changing of all planes
In the universe by a bad magician
To conquer the power of this magic
A place where truth waits must be found Tanelorn

Damned for all time - who am I?
Once I've been called Erekose

I was Elric - I'll be Corum I'm the prince of the south ice
Now I'm nothing Wait for someone Wait for Ilian No! I'm Hawkmoon

Oblivion - the war is eternal
Oblivion - the battle is endless

[Ref:] Damned...

4. Follow The Blind
Follow the blind
Your journey, your last hope, it can begin
These passing dreams were real not fantasy
There are more things than we know Come take my hand
[Solo:Andre]

Searching for the talisman you'll find it
On another plane far from all time
Maybe you wonder while you see The same faces
Everywhere You can find yourself in it
'cause you're a part

I'm another Strange my feelings Where I am here For a short time
I remember I had been here
[Solo:Marcus]

[Ref:]
I'm alone, follow me!
Calling you, follow me!
I'm alone, follow me!
Follow the blind
Follow me
Follow me it's my time
Follow me
Follow the blind

Wandering in my darkest dreams Iron shadows are lurking at me
In this desert the tyrant's calling On the run to save my love
She's full of pain The queen is lying far behind
In an endless dream
[Solo:Andre]

Before I thought I was dreaming
A strange voice whispers in my ears
You're the rat in the trap
Return, pain will come to you

Ref: I'm alone...No!
[Lead:Andre]

5. Hall Of The King
Alone I walk, hearing a voice, That's calling my name
No one with you, God, why I didn't care
On through death take me away
To the place time will not fade
Colder than dead, Darkness - eternity, But look out

A hundred thousand centuries The sun had never seen
So near but much too far Eternal place you know what's life
But cannot tell

I can never see you changing But you look to me
Time will never heal your wounds But you're immortal

Hall of the King a vision of the end
Hall of the King don't cry for us
Don't hear us calling Oh watch out for me Hall of the light
My last sin

You find yourself, just take a look To see you must open your eyes
Like a hawk in the sky, a wonder that dies Don't ask me why

[Lead:Andre]

You're the birth and you're the end
You've been hurt but you're not dead
Discovering you is what should never be
Poisoned are our souls, And dark our hearts
Ruins we have left to rule the world
Destructive are our minds, It's much too late
[Solo:Kai Hansen / Harmony lead: Kai Hansen]

[Ref:] Hall...

6. Fast To Madness
[Lead:Andre]

White hair and red eyes he is holding the crown
The king of the island Elric Melnibone
He's born for destruction
He's ruled by the Gods eternal hero
The scale of the universe

Blood on his hands he's born a thousand times
Why don't we feel the signs from the dragon king
[Lead:Andre]

Before the end of fire his journey starts
The eagle's spreading his wings following his fate
He's ruled from anywhere leads him to truth it's deep inside

Hail to the king they bless tonight He's the Saviour of our time
In a dark land far behind no one knows its name
There's a dark sword cold as ice A blade created for him

Stormbringer cries for the soul of everyone
Stormbringer cries "The ending has begun"

[Ref:]
Run fast to madness Forever I
Run fast to madness Leave him alone
[Solo:Andre]

[Ref:] Run...

Destiny calling him back to the island
And time? Time is standing still
Time is not real [2x]

Armed with weapon awaiting the fight
He's leading the dragon The sun will never rise
Creatures are lurking in darkness they hide
High in the sky the dragon king is flying
[Lead:Andre]

Hail to the king of Melnibone
He's the Saviour of our time

Mourning desert rottenness Blade of dark will rise
Gods divine are hiding in the dark Needing Elric's hand

Stormbringer cries "I'm forged in darkest time"
Stormbringer cries "The ending has begun"

[Ref:] Run...
[Lead:Andre]

7. Beyond The Ice
[Instrumental]
[Lead: Andre]

8. Valhalla
High in the sky where eagles fly Morgray the dark enters the throne

Open wide the gate friend the king will come
Blow the horn and praise the highest lord
Who'll bring the dawn he's a new god in the palace of steel
Persuade the fate of everyone The chaos can begin let it in

[Lead:Andre]

[Bridge:(Kai Hansen)]
So many centuries, so many gods
We were the prisoners of our own fantasy
But now we are marching against these gods
I'm the wizard, I'll change it all

[Ref:]
Valhalla - Deliverance
Why've you ever forgotten me [2x]

[Solo:Andre]

Magic is in me
I'm the last magic man
Never found what I was looking for
Now I found it but it's lost

The fortress burns
Broken my heart
I leave this world
All gods are gone

[Bridge:(Kai Hansen)]
So many centuries, so many gods
We were the prisoners of our own fantasy
But then we had nothing to lead our life
No, no, we can't live without Gods

[Ref:] Valhalla...

9. Don't Break The Circle
[by Demon]

Don't break the circle
Don't break the circle

Concentrate!
I'm your contact link across the great divide
Many voices in my ear
Hold on I think there's something coming through
From the other side. It's for all those who believe
The chain is stronger if the lifeline is unbroken
So beware the presence of The Unexpected Guest

Don't break the circle
Don't break the circle

Unexplained
Many things we thought were lost may come to light
On a higher plain in the spirit world
Where only a few of us possess the second sight
Now the messenger awaits
The chain is stronger if the lifeline is unbroken
So beware the presence of The Unexpected Guest

Don't break the circle
Don't break the circle.The circle must keep going on and on

But wait
Is there one amongst us here who believes?
A stranger to the sign
Take care, for all the things you fear
May be revealed
Within the forces of the night
The chain is stronger if the lifeline is unbroken
So beware the presence of The Unexpected Guest

1. Majesty
Now the time has come for me to leave this land
Take my charge with pride sacrifice
Running and hiding I'm left for the time
To bring back the order of divine
Hunted by goblins no Gandalf to help
With swords in the night
Oh the last part of the game
Decision of death and life
Blood for Sauron they'll call tonight
The final battle cry
Running and hiding I'm left for the time
To bring back the order of divine
There exist no tales and hobbits are crying for all
Children of death
I have a dream the things you've to hide for
Deliver our kingdom and our Reich
Don't fall in panic just give me the thing
That I need or I kill
Don't run away for what have I done

[Ref.:]
Oh majesty your kingdom is lost
And you'll leave us behind
Oh majesty your kingdom is lost
And ruins remind of your time
Now come back

[Solo]

Run, run, run

Cries Cries in a dark land
Hear the voice it's cold as ice
Eyes they are watching
They look for me but cannot find
Creature is following no place to escape
My last steps will find the right way
Where's the future the call of the blind
Cause there is none to find
Watch the sky you see no light
My weapons burst with fear
With the howling wolves the nazgul will die
For all Children of death
Cries Cries in a dark land
Hear the voice it's cold as ice
Eyes they are watching
They look for me but cannot find
Run Run for the whole world
It's time you cannot wait
Lost Lost in a dark world
You feel the strange but cannot see
Too many battles we carry along from the war
And too many frightens we feel from his law
For so many victories we're praising so strong
For so many blood we've lost

[Ref.]
Run, run

2. Guardian Of The Blind
Extermination thunder the strange one is
back again
Lost by our only power it's aura will grind us
out forever
Fall into a dark dream that we got once
the part it's real you won't believe
We're watching our own agony many years ago
Seven little children stand against the ghost
Believing is the answer but you've lost before
Find back to your infancy it's time to die
I've been the herdsman you've been my sheep
I find taste on lampskin everything's allright
killing for the thirst for small children sweat
I give them illusions to raise their fear
Hear the crying dying child it's music to my ears
Feel the sweetness of it's death everything's allright
But there's a new feeling I've never known
There must be a third one a mighty guardian

Dark is it's world. and lonely we're reaching it
again
Fear our returning visions to madness we'll
fall
if we can't kill the beast forever
we must die now
One has blown his life away
Once we were a circle fighting hand in hand
Our weapons were illusions to let it feel the pain
By the sweet taste of our live it call us back again
We'll find the answer it's time to die
By a ritual we've hurt it but we've not kill
little Billy you must find your way
Believe in you we ask for
but where
we can never find
there must be a sign for the
Guardian of the Blind

[Ref.:]

4. Wizard's Crown
Years ago I came back
this has been my hardest attack
A burning fire's in my brain
I could feel the deadly flame
Tales of the magic in my head
to a dark dream I fall in my mind
I hold the key of fortune
To feel the strange thing's in my mind
the stone of Ambar I must find
I'll take the chance that day

[Ref.:]
Halloween - The wizards crown I'll take on
Halloween
Halloween - But there is no return on Halloween

I'm the servant of the Blind to cross the

In magic spell I fall
Illusions falling in my mind
But where's the key I cannot find
the ritual has begun

[Ref.]

The battle has begun

5. Run For The Night
There comes the last part and end of our old age
with thunder and lightning the dark lord is taking
the crown of the whole world
his creature will kill me and poisons my soul
to the end I'll fight but I know that the things
that I do are so meanless - Oh no

I see the hill but it's so far away
I know I can't reach it
but I try it again and again in my dark dreams
he's waysting my last will how long can I stay here
when the mightiest of all will now

[Ref.:]
Run for the Night burn away

to the end I'll fight but I know that the things
that I do are so meanless - Oh no
I see the hill but it's so far away
I know I can't reach it
but try it again and again in my dark dreams
he's waysting my last will
how long can I stay here

6. The Martyr
He was born in the past time
To take all our pain
The kingdom of heaven's near
The children of this time
Must die for his arrive
To let all the legends be true
The prophecy said they'll call king of the Jews
He is born now to take all our sins
Three kings were searching for this holy child
The journey begins, he has to die

[Lead]
[Bridge]

Healing the cripples and taking our pain
He came for the sinner
But what we've said
Disciples are following
They are calling his words
Salt of the earth and light of the world

[Ref.:]
Martyr - we are following you
Bless us for eternity
Messiah - we are torturing you
When you lose the power of your words

Jump from the temple and angle will save
Show me that you are the son of our God
Now take my land with my power you get
Rulin' the world of tomorrow
Messiah liar our burning desire
He is the king without a crown
We'll set him to his throne
Give me 30 p of silver and I'll be your man
Higher liar the fallen Messiah
Let us see his agony
The things he done are blasphemy
Mob has lost their joy on toy
So let us kill him fast
Now drink my blood for the new testament
This is my body you eat
One of you twelve is the one who betrays
Better that he's never born
Judas you're the chosen one
The world has damned your name

[Lead]
[Bridge]

Begin with a kiss
At a cross it will end
The kingdom of heaven we've passed
The sky will turn black and the curtain will fall
The father's crying for his son
The tortured Messiah is finding his way
The journey has come to the end
The twelve ones are preaching the words he'd left
They're changing the way of the world but die for

[Solo]

[Ref.]

Martyr - we are following you
Bless us for eternity
No

7. Battalions Of Fear
Can't believe the things I see
That happens in the state
By a mortal distance that I can't believe
Self destructive infernal
To save us from the breed
But I know that it is all a lie
Star wars begin now
His bombs come exploding
To bring back the death of the night
No mercy he's knowing
How strong he must show us
For the last film you all get a part
Be by my side
Or you've to die
Believe what I do is the right
Soon Armageddon
Last hours are running now
The final solution begins
The words of a madman
No children to tell them
For what they'll not see in the light
Choose by your voice
He kills and destroys
At the end you must die for the night
In earlier chess games
We're playing the part of a soldier
But now we are not qualified
To save our own life
The traps are all placed by command
They are ready to strike
We live and we'll die
By the lies to believe

[Lead]

[PreChorus:]
Try to escape from this suicide dreams
Or past time will come back again
Hiroshima is a joke to that what will come
At the end of the game we all die
Die now

[Ref.:]
Battalions of fear
They search and they scream
For the American dreams
Battalions of fear
The way of R.R.
To show he is the star
Battalions

Star wars

[Solo]

With hands full of blood
He talks about peace
With snake poisoning tongue
He's praying
El Salvador and Vietnam
You soon fast forget
But you satisfy on Afghanistan
You've been the master
You kill with a laughter
Your screams of peace are wrong and loud
Cause so we are and here we are
We scream and shout!
Your laughing about all the fools
Scream and shout!
With power of evil they stand

[PreChorus, repeat]

The Morning Sun of Dune
The Morning Sun of Dune

[lead: Andre]

The holy war's
waiting for
the morning sun [3x]
The morning sun of Dune
there's no tomorrow
the apparation of this land and it's dream
makes me feel I've seen it before
I can taste there's life
everywhere you can find
in the desert of my life
I see it again and again

[lead: Andre]

And again, again, again, again
dark tales have brought the Dijahd
like whispering echos in the wind
and I'm a million miles from home

[Ref:]
Traveler in time
knowing that there's no rhyme

[lead: Andre]

The morning sun is near
first light of dawn is here
the morning sun is near again
The Fremen sing that
their kingdom will come
and I'm the leading one
battlefields on our crusade
filled with Sardokaurs
killing machines crying
in raising fear they're hiding
Where do we go now?
So where is the way?
When I'm a million miles from home

[Ref]

[solo: Andre]

The morning sun I feel
all pain and sorrow
the apparition of my words in these days
makes me feel I've told them before
all my plans will come true
I'll control destiny
in the desert of my life
I've seen it again and again

[lead: Andre]

By my dreams I must find the way
to stop the raging war
I've to choose now
I will leave
my body and see
and time will stand still
when I have to leave
my body and find
a way back to the world I love
when I'm a million miles from home

2. Welcome To Dying
Close to insanity
beyond the realms I've been
at darkest places
I'm crying
"The dragon flies"

[lead: Andre]

Something savage
is yearning for me
I'm waiting afraid for the night
what will be
I've lost myself
a few days ago
it's touching my soul
and a vision of past dreams comes true

[Ref:]
Welcome to dying
I don't let it out
Welcome to dying
Look to the mirror it shows what I am
Welcome to dying
This town must burn now
Welcome to dying
Can't you see the dragon's seed bears in me
the one who's been before

many times I terrorized this town
many times and here I start again
now I'm stronger and so cold
cold as ice
returning is my destiny
now I feel it's growing up in me
now I feel it's burning deep in me
I'm not what I was before
could I stop this dream
I'm a stranger to myself
and I cannot control

[Ref:]
Welcome to dying
I don't let it out
Welcome to dying
Look to the mirror it shows what I am
Welcome to dying
Can't you see the dragon's seed bears in me
Welcome to dying
The dragon's breath I don't let it out

[solo: Andre]

I'm a savage
it's too late for me
the other side's taking control and I know
there's one way I can walk alone
or the dragon will fly
and a growing fear's all that I feel

[Rep. 1st ref.]

Welcome to dying [6x]
Can't you see the dragon's seed bears in me

Spread my wings and fly away
I spread my wings and fly away
I spread my wings and fly away

3. Weird Dreams
[Instrumental]

4. Lord Of The Rings
There are signs on the ring which make me feel so down
There's one to enslave all rings to find them all in time
And drive them into darkness
Forever they'll be bound

Three for the Kings of the elves high in light
Nine to the mortal which cry

[Solo: Markus]

[Ref (x2):]
Slow down and I sail on the river
Slow down and I walk to the hill

And there's no way out
Mordor
Dark land under Sauron's spell
Threatened a long time
Threatened a long time

Seven rings to the gnomes in their halls made of stone
Into the valley
I feel down

One ring for the dark lord's hand sitting on his throne
In the land so dark where I have to go

[Solo: Markus]

[Ref]

Lord of the rings

5. Goodbye My Friend
Who can tell me who I am
who I am my friend
I'm an Alien so they say
a risk to everyone
No - Tell me what do they see
No - Tell me what do they feel
No - Tell me what do they fear
No - Tell me what do they see
I'm a dwarf but I know more than you
and I'm a key to a better life
from terror I could escape
but I need your helping hand
so far from home where I'm left alone
Did you hear my crying?
Did you hear my crying?

[Ref:]
Goodbye my friend
I found you at the end
I say Goodbye to all
Goodbye my friend
thanks for your helping hand
I say Goodbye to all my cries
just say Goodbye

[lead Andre]

No returning nevermore
No returning nevermore

[lead Andre]

And I'll remember
Communication to you is so strange
You trust to no one no warmths reach your heart
to you I'm the stranger but you're strange to me
You destruct all what is unknown to you
We are together now
and don't you know I'll come back again
I must go now

[Ref:] Goodbye...

[Solo Andre]

I will go home now
I will go home now
much too long I'm forced to stay
in visions I see
so dark and so deep
mankind will destruct all life
See you again I hope I will
see you again at the end?
My tortured soul can't forget the pain
now I find my way back
I WILL GO HOME NOW
I WILL GO HOME NOW

[Ref:] Goodbye...

6. Lost In The Twilight Hall
Awaiting my last breath
the mirror calls my name
it's showing me the way
into the dark
the bridge appears
I jump into the dark side
and hear the voice it's cold as ice
"Welcome to reality"
Where am I now?
Darkness surrounds
can't go forward
can't go back
[Kai:] I see planets dying
[Hansi:] I fall into the light
[K:] a new universe awakens
[H:] I'm a Traveler in Time
[K:] Pray for the light
[H:] Where's the key
[K:] To the gate
[H/K:] of a new life - no
[H:] I search for deliverance
[K:] But I cannot find

[lead Andre]

[Ref:]
Look behind the mirror
I'm lost in the twilight hall
once I'll be back for a moment in time
that's when the mirror's falling down

[lead Andre]

Take me away
from the place I've been
to another life
in another world
a sign of life
surrounds me now
the bridge appears in the dark
I'm free
I fly alone
leaving this darkness now, forever?
the memories of children
and the wisdom of many lifes
burns deep in me
Where will the light go to?
Where will the light go to?
Is this deliverance?
Is it the end?

[Ref:] Look...

[solo Andre]

I'm back there's a new chance for me
and all my memories are gone
I can feel what's happening to me
and the mirror will burst

[Ref:] Look... [2x]

7. Tommyknockers
[lead Andre]

She's opening her eyes
to find the thing
by a touch she's lost
it's waiting for her a long time
the kingdom's lost
cause there's one nail missing
playing with fire
turn of the light
and she'll fall down
playing with her life
but she can't leave it
there's one rhyme in her brain

[lead Andre]

[Ref:]
Oh, last night and the night before
Tommyknockers, Tommyknockers
knocked at your back door
Tommyknockers

[lead Andre]

The pain in my head
the cycle awakes
I'm on my way to Oz
I want to drink and she wants to dig
she's in trouble oh I know
there's something going wrong
Tommyknockers on their way
What's up in "Leighton street"?

[Ref:]
Oh, last night and the night before
Tommyknockers, Tommyknockers
knocked at your back door

[lead Andre]

I'm the hero, I'm back
with weapons and with magic spells
I'll seddle every task
an old, ill and drunken guy

[lead Andre]

The moon is full of blood
I've found her not, not far from home
I should better get away from here
she's on her way to be another one
playing with fire
she can read my thoughts
it's too late
playing with her life
Tommyknockers brought her trouble

[solo Andre]

The ship in the earth I touch
a vibration is filling me
and music is in my head
nose is bleeding
and my fall down
filled me with pain
you'll be like a Tommyknocker
I'll be like you
but there's something going wrong
I read it in your face

[Ref:]
Oh, last night and the night before
Tommyknockers, Tommyknockers
knocked at your back door
Tommyknockers knocked at your back door
Tommyknockers knocked at your back door

8. Altair 4
At Hilly's show
they didn't know
that the Ending of "Being" is near
I can feel their voices
the old man cries
"Please save the boy
he's caught in a world far behind
from home"
Monster Anne is crying out
"Feel my pain I can't escape"
Bad chances for me

[Ref:]
Altair 4 [3x]
chosen by their whispering words
What is left behind?
When purple colors turn to black
Can you feel it?
Is there time?
Can you see it?
Is there life?
"Fly away and dream"

9. The Last Candle
Guardian, Guardian, Guardian of the Blind [4x]
Have you forgotten him

[lead Andre]

Far from the land
where the sun is born
down in the wood "Caladon"
Do you know that place
where the light is never seen
and all hopes are turned
by the final cry
Turned to Stone [4x]

[lead Andre]

Whispering tunes in the wind
all hopes are gone with the night
when the old man will never come back
remember his words and his songs
And we see the raven flying in the distance
but no wizard's singing his song

[Ref:]
Somebodies out in the night
I fly in time
the last candle will burn
there's hope for everyone
when the last candle burns high
oh it's time for life

[lead Andre]

The elves and gnomes have to hide
when the moon is showing it's face
and raging orcs will set their traps
and all forests will burn
they hate green trees
and love the dark
they don't understand
that they're caught and left alone
they feel the magic in the wind
they just fear the old man's song

[solo Kai]

[Ref:]
Somebodies...

[lead Andre]

Corrupted old gnome
betrayer of all
you know so much about all
what is your price?

[GNOME:]
"Too much, too much
you cannot pay with your silver and your gold
there's just a little chance to save the wizard's life
there's just a little chance for all you fools
now pay"

[lead Andre]

And so I walk across the land
and hope to hear the wizard's song

[Ref:]
Somebodies... [2x]

[Outro:]
Somebodies out there
I feel there's somebody
Somebodies out there
I feel there's somebody

10. Run For The Night
There comes the last part and end of our old age
with thunder and lightning the dark lord is taking
the crown of the whole world
his creatures will kill me and poisons my soul
to the end I'll fight but I know that the things
that I do are meaningless - Oh no
I see the hill byt it's so far away
I know I can't reach it

when the mightiest of all will now

[Ref:]
Run for the Night burn away
the times of his fall I've to pay
Visions of darkness prepared for the last strike
and bloodlust their weapons and madness
you see to their
eyes there's no way out
I'm lost in a dark dream and losing control
to the end I'll fight but I know that the things
that I do are so meanless - Oh no
I see the hill but it's so far away I know I can't
reach it
but try it again and again in my dark dreams
he's waysting my last will
how long can I stay here
when the mightiest of all will now

they've been scared and they've been anxiously tonight
you see them running with the wind they
run for the night [3x]

1. Time What Is Time
When the moonchild is crying
And silence has broken
The darkest truth

The things she remembered
Had never been her own
Replicant or human
I know the way to show
What do I see
What will I find
Know the answer inside
It's your last step

Time what is time
I wish I knew how to tell you why
It hurts to know
Aren't we machines
Time what is time
Unlock the door
And see the truth
Then time is time again

[Whispering]
These dreams were never mine
It's cold inside
It's gone forever
The things he saw
Who can say what's wrong or right
The vision of a free life
His eyes had seen it all
For what
He's asking
The vision, vision, vision
I know it's all a lie
I'll remember the past life
And I'll remember time

[Lead: Andre]

What did I see
What have I done
God I knew the answers
When he felt so tired

Time what is time
Come lock the door don't let me in
I am the one your destiny
Time what is time
Reality - it hurts me so
When time is time again

[Solo: Andre]

Look into my eyes
Feel the fear just for a while
I'm a replicant and I love to live
Is it all over now
Only these years
I'll leave but I'm singing

Time what is time
He saw it clearly it's too late
It does not heal but it lets us forget
Time what is time
We'll never know
So don't take care
Then time is time again

Should I forget
The way I feel
God he knows how long I tried
Feel there is no reason to cry
I live my life
In fortune dreams forever

2. Journey Through The Dark
Many songs I've written
About the things I saw
My inner soul's a wasteland
I can't run away from here
Try to find them
All the lost thoughts in my mind
I woke up on a hill
So many times before
Yesterday seems like a dream no more
Frozen memories laughing
They don't let me find the truth
Am I born to be a king
Or a jester of the fools

You're the mystical old bard
on your journey through the dark
Mystical old bard
Your journey through the dark

I can't remember my name
I never knew how to find my home
I can't remember my name
come tell me when will it end
I'm the chosen one
To perform all these things
But not for me
In illusions and reality
I'm on my journey through the dark
I'm on my journey through the dark

Mystical old bard
On your journey through the dark
Mystical old bard
Your journey through the dark

[Solo: Andre]

I can't remember
Will I ever find myself
The distance is growing
My hope has gone away
A flash of light but nothing changes
When will it end
Which part of me remains

[Lead: Andre]

Soon I'll be back
On my ferryboat of tales
Where oblivion reigns
It will take all of me
Mystical old bard
On your journey through the dark
Mystical old bard
Your journey through the dark

3. Black Chamber
I am lost in the black chamber
There's no way to turn back
It takes me down forevermore
And death would be so sweet
I'm possessed by the old creature
Who has planned all
To take my soul
Too late for me
In my hands
It lies I thought
But I failed
Now he's in me

My soul is lost
In his black chamber

I'm gone

4. Theatre Of Pain
[Lead: Andre]

The giant's lost
And all around him
Destructed for what
They all knew what it meant
But they couldn't change it
Lord they had gone too far
Leave them alone

It's all gone
What is left behind
On a desert we called earth
When the last whale went away
Did they ever see the tears

Don't fear your last step
From the theatre of pain
And the children will love your singing
From the sea
The sea is calling
Now we've to leave it

The sea was clear
On the day I was stranded
Answers I'd known
To keep this all alive
But I can't change it
Forever

[Solo: Andre]

Now I'm gone
And it seems that life has never existed
So we left the dark and cold
All I left behind are my tears

Don't fear your last step
From the theatre of pain
And the children will love your singing
From the sea
The sea is calling
I hear them calling

5. The Quest For Tanelorn
By the ruins he stands
And he's waiting for me
To enter Tanelorn
His paths seem strange
But they're always planned
Seldom he succeeds
About his own fate

[Lead: Andre]

He tries to conquer it
Again and again
But at last he's almost
A ruined man
Not a king or God
Who's searching for
A place called Tanelorn
Far beyond your dreams

[Lead: Andre]

On our quest for Tanelorn
We lose our way
On our quest for Tanelorn
He's waiting
He's waiting for me
He's waiting
He's waiting for me

[Lead: Kai]

Darkness falling down on me
Darkness - The eternal battle rises

I know the answers
Although they don't exist
I'm just a mortal illusion

On our quest for Tanelorn
We lose our way
On our quest for Tanelorn

[Solo: Kai]

So I'm his companion
Through space and through time
His eternal servant
He's calling me
So I must leave
To another life
To another world
Far beyond your dreams

[Lead: Kai]

To know the truth
Just for a while
He's longing for a place
Where he can find himself
Deliverance
It could be everywhere
How can he find
He's waiting for me
And for you
Tanelorn

On our quest for Tanelorn
We lose our way
On our quest for Tanelorn
We lose our way
On our quest for Tanelorn
We lose our way
On our quest for Tanelorn
We lose our way
[Refrain leads by Kai]

6. Ashes To Ashes
Taste the poison
Feel that this is life
Hallowed be the game
Of life and innocence
God's waiting for him
Join us at the road to fate
There are two paths
Feel the pain
Which steps into his life
Agony
He'll be crucified
Death awaits
Knocking at his door
Agony
Leave him
The clock will strike the end
Hell or heaven
Reflect and fade away

Ashes to ashes, dust to dust
The life clock strikes and you obey
Like a candle light that fades
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust
When the life clock strikes you obey
Time isn't here to stay
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust
The life clock strikes and you obey
A light shows the right way

[Lead: Andre]

Morning is whispering in my head
Too late to say goodbye
Too late
The last breath's done
Deliverance and all
He's born to find his end
I am the one
The one who's calling
Obey my call to the cemetery
And don't be afraid
To step into the dark
Be sure that my voice
will take you home

Ashes to ashes, dust to dust
The life clock strikes and you obey
Like a candle light that fades
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust
When the life clock strikes you obey
Time isn't here to stay
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust

[Solo: Andre]

No hope he'd waited so long
This can't be God's will
He surrendered long ago
There was no real chance
Ashes to ashes, and dust will be dust
Ashes to ashes, you all will be dust again

[Lead: Andre]

The clock has struck the end
Up to heaven
Reflexions fade away

Ashes to ashes, dust to dust
The life clock strikes and you obey
Like a candle light that fades
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust
When the life clock strikes you obey
Time isn't here to stay
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust
The life clock strikes and you obey
Light shows the right way

Taste the poison
Feel that this is life
Hallowed be the game!

7. The Bard's Song - In The Forest
Now you all know
The bards and their songs
When hours have gone by
I'll close my eyes
In a world far away
We may meet again
But now hear my song
About the dawn of the night
Let's sing the bards' song

Tomorrow will take us away
Far from home
No one will ever know our names
But the bards' songs will remain
Tomorrow will take it away
The fear of today
It will be gone
Due to our magic songs

There's only one song
Left in my mind
Tales of a brave man
Who lived far from here
Now the bard songs are over
And it's time to leave
No one should ask you for the name
Of the one
Who tells the story

Tomorrow will take us away
Far from home
No one will ever know our names
But the bards' songs will remain
Tomorrow all will be known
And you're not alone
So don't be afraid
In the dark and cold
'Cause the bards' songs will remain
They all will remain

In my thoughts and in my dreams
They're always in my mind
These songs of hobbits, dwarfs and men
And elves
Come close your eyes
You can see them too

8. The Bard's Song - The Hobbit
Out in the distance
There's so much gold
The treasure that I've found
Is more than enough
Far to the hill we've to go
Over the mountains and seas
To the old hill
Where the old dragon sleeps
Blind in the dark dungeon's night
So God please take me away from here
And Gollum shows the way right out

[Solo: Andre]

I'm alive

The dying dragon brought trouble and pain
And horror to the halls of stone
I'll take the mighty stone
And leave the dwarfs behind
Ice and fire and forest we passed
And horror in the halls of stone

Trolls in the dark
The dawn took them all
Caught in the wood
By the wooden king's men
But now I'm alone
'Cause I've made up my mind
By the spell of gold

[Lead: Andre]

The king under the mountain
Will risk the great war
Oh what a fool
He's losing control
So I am trying to find a way
Blind in the dark dungeon's night
Then darkness comes from the northern side
And Thorin clears his mind

9. The Piper's Calling
[instrumental]

10. Somewhere Far Beyond
I came from far
Beyond your reality
The ocean of time
It's the odyssey of mine
I am the narrator
And now I'll tell you
Where I've been
And what I saw
And how it ends

[Lead: Andre]

Welcome to the wasteland
In a world that's turning faster
Where I'm alone for a while

[Lead: Andre]

It's turning faster
Away from light straight to the dark
The march of time it has begun
I'm caught in an ancient dream so bright
And then the march of time begins

The man in black he waits
Behind this last task
It's full of pain
To sacrifice the only son
The legions of the lost
Wait in the old mine
They try to stop me
The battle it has begun

So I'm not afraid
To walk down the wasteland
I'm so alone on my way
And I don't fear that dusty godforsaken path
Somewhere far beyond

Somewhere far beyond
The march of time it has begun
Somewhere far beyond your reality
And then the march of time begins

[Lead: Andre]

Look at my soul
And behind
There are some thins
I've to hide from you
I'm following the black man
I'm losing control
And I don't care
What's happening to the boy

Welcome to a new world
One more step to the dark tower
And my whole body's in flames
I'm looking for
Those healing things to be prepared
The march of time it has begun
I'm caught in a prisoner's dirty life
And then the march of time begins

The prisoner did bring the healing spell
The queen of shadows found herself in pain
And death brings answers to us all

What will I find
When the dark tower appears
Will it be the end
Or just a new quest after all
I am the narrator
And now I'll tell you
Where I'd been
And what I saw
And how it ends

[Solo: Andre]

Somewhere far beyond
The march of time it has begun
Somewhere far beyond your reality
And then the march of time...
Somewhere far beyond
The march of time it has begun
Somewhere far beyond your reality
And then the march of time begins

Look around and see
The world is turning fast
Faster day by day
Somewhere far beyond
I'll try to change it
If I can - Somewhere far beyond
There's only one chance
And it lies - Somewhere far beyond
Somewhere far beyond
The march of time it has begun
The march of time it has begun

11. Spread Your Wings
[originally recorded by Queen]

Sammy was low,
just watching the show,
over and over again.
He knew it was time,
he'd made up his mind,
to leave his dead life behind.

His boss said to him
boy, you'd better begin
to get those crazy notions
right out of your head
Sammy who do you think that you are?
You should have been sweeping,
at the emerald bar.

spread your wings and fly away,
fly away, far away.
Spread your little wings and fly away
fly away, far away.
Pull yourself together,
'cause you know you should do better,
that's because you're a free man.

He spends his evenings alone,
in his hotelroom.
Keeping his thoughts to himself,
he'd be leaving soon.
Wishing he was miles and miles away,
nothing in this world, nothing,
would make him stay.

Since he was small,
had no luck at all,
nothing came easy to him.
Now it was time,
he'd made up his mind,
this could be my last change

His boss said to him
now listen boy, you're always dreaming,
you got no real ambition,
you won't get worried for.
Sammy, boy don't you know who you are?
why can't you be happy,
at the emerald bar?

(So honey) spread you wings and fly away,
fly away, far away.
spread your little wings and fly away,
fly away, far away.
pull yourself together,
'cause you know you should do better,
that's because your a free man.
come on honey (fly with me)...

12. Trial By Fire
[originally recorded by Satan]

In 1945 the year it came to be
Their fate decided
many miles across the sea
They told them not to fear
they couldn't be prepared.
Then came the day
that not a single soul was spared.

Too late there's no escape
The Trial has begun
Down they fly
From out of the sky
Feel the radiation burn !

The men of power
had nothing to fear.
When the finger hits the switch
they're far away from here.
Down in their sanctuary
hiding in their lair.
The sorcerers of justice
will be waiting for them there.

Too late there's no escape
The Trial has begun
Down they fly
From out of the sky
Feel the radiation burn !

I saw the people running
through all my dreams.
I heard the soldiers crying,
Mother Nature screams.
I saw destruction falling
from out of the sky.
I heard the Wise Man calling .... WHY ???????

In 1945 the year it came to be
Their fate decided
many miles across the sea
They told them not to fear
they couldn't be prepared.
Then came the day
that not a single soul was spared.

Too late there's no escape
The Trial has begun
Down they fly
From out of the sky
Feel the radiation burn !

13. Theatre Of Pain
[classic version]

The giant's lost
And all round him
Destructed for what
They all knew what it meant
But they couldn't change it
Lord they had gone too far
Leave them alone

It's all gone
What is left behind
On a desert we called earth
When the last whale went away
Did they ever see the tears

Don't fear Your last step
From the theatre of pain
And the children will love Your singing
From the sea
The sea is calling
Now we've to leave it

The sea was clear
On the day I was stranded
Answers I'd known
To keep this all alive
But I can't change it
Forever

[Solo]

Now I'm gone
And it seems that life had never existed
So we left the dark and cold
All I left behind are my tears

Don't fear Your last step
From the theatre of pain
And the children will love Your singing
From the sea
The sea is calling
I hear them calling

1. Imaginations From The Other Side
Where are these silent faces
I took them all
They all went away
Now you're alone
To turn out every light so deep in me
Hold on, too late

Will I ever see them back again
Or did they all die by my hand

Or were they killed
By the old evil ghost
Who had taken
The ocean
Of all my dreams
Which were worth to keep
Deep inside my heart
I wish I
Could get them back
From the everflow
Before they'll fade away
Imaginations from the other side
Far out of nowhere
It got back to my mind
Imaginations from the other side
Far out of nowhere
It got back to my mind
Out of the dark
Back to the light
Then I'll break down
The walls around my heart
Imaginations from the other side

Where's the ocean's daughter
Was Peter Pan in Mordor
No one's there to keep alive
All these fairy tales
May I return to Oz
Will I meet the "Tin Man"
"Coward Lion" where are you
Without brain the scarecrow's lost
In the middle of the lake
Stranded in the real world
Left in the world
No place for daydreams
Serious life
I fall into
I fall into a dark hole
And I can't come out
Do you know if Merlin did exist
Or Frodo wore the ring
Did Corum kill the gods
Or where's the wonderland
Which young Alice had seen
Or was it just a dream
I knew the answers
Now they're lost for me

Imaginations from the other side
Far out of nowhere
It got back to my mind
Imaginations from the other side
Far out of nowhere
It got back to my mind
Out of the dark
Back to the light
Then I'll break down
The walls around my heart
Imaginations from the other side

[SOLO]

I hope there is a way back
With my talisman
So I look into myself
Into the days when I was just a child
Come follow me to wonderland
And see the tale that never ends
Don't fear the lion nor the witch
I can't come back
I'm lost but still I know
There is another world

Imaginations from the other side
Far out of nowhere
It got back to my mind
Imaginations from the other side
Far out of nowhere
It got back to my mind
Out of the dark
Back to the light
Then I'll break down
The walls around my heart
Imaginations from the other side

2. I'm Alive
I run through the dark fields
Of the plains
Reach level 99
The pain cuts deep down
Through my vain
How will I break the ice
Welcome to my reality
Dream forever
Sunlight instead of neon light
How will it be
Welcome to my grave
And feel the dream is over
Nothing can stop me
I reach out for the top

Caught in an old cage
The system failed
Built up on lies
Now I see that I'm alone
In asylum's cage
I'm left alone

I'm alive my friend
I can feel the shadows everywhere
I'm alive
I left the shadows
Far behind me
Another one is waiting in the dark

They say the system keeps
The last chance to survive
Caught in this labyrinth
Of walls and lot's of lies
Then I began to understand
There's more above then ice
To reach the top
I crept deep down
The answers given in the past
A senseless worth
In useless brains
Magic runes
Without a meaning
Besides the dark
There should be nothing left

Caught in an old cage
The system failed
Built up on lies
Now I see that I'm alone
In asylum's cage
I'm left alone

I'm alive my friend
I can feel the shadows everywhere
I'm alive
I left the shadows
Far behind me
Another one is waiting in the dark

[SOLO]

Outside they say death is waiting
But it creeps down through the shaft
Finds pleasure in our helpless fear
Fills empty rooms with morbid thought
They've locked the door
And hold the key

Sitting beside you
When silent screams
Changing my mind and dreams
Oh, it's never ending

Caught in an old cage
The system failed
Built up on lies
Now I see that I'm alone
In asylum's cage
I'm left alone

I'm alive my friend
I can feel the shadows everywhere
I'm alive
I left the shadows
Far behind me
Another one is waiting
In the dark
I'M ALIVE!

3. A Past And Future Secret
Oh, I haven't been here for a while
In blindness and decay
The circle's been closed, now

My song of the end
I've seen it all

Listen crowd
I'll tell you everything
Though I have to say
I didn't know much
Talking about a past
And future secret
Most call him once
And future king
Far back in the past
I saw his ending
Long before it started
I knew his name
He's the one who took the sword
Out of the stone
It's now that ancient tale began
I hear it in the cold winds

My song of the end
I had seen it in my dreams
My song of the end
I can't stop the darkening clouds

I feel cold
When I cry out for the bark
Take him back to Avalon
Dwell on for the new age
So long sleep well my friend
Take him back to Avalon
I will wait and guard
The future king's crown

My song of the end
It was nice but now it's gone
My song of the end
It was fixed the whole time
My song of the end
I saw it all

4. The Script For My Requiem
Hallowed be the fatherland
God he knows
How long I'd been away
From here I did start for the search so
Full of disease
I still hear my cry outs
From the old cellar's inside

Born in the days of medieval
My inner voice
Is always asking why

I came from nowhere
Without a task, without a name
Don't fear my evil
Fate, so god please lead me through
Forgotten realms
Mysterious dreams
In sunless rooms I'd sworn
I'll finish what I started, once
I'll find the holy grail
In the holy land

Returning of the miracles
It's my own requiem
The jester's tears
They are inside me
Agony's the script for my requiem
Returning of the miracles
It's my own requiem
Is the script already written
Jester's tears I cry
Yes, I cry

I went out of my mind
In desert lands
Insanity's pawn
Out of control
Much too long I've been isolated
From my thoughts
Enclosed by the leader's spell
Bewildered to march
As a glory knight
And I tried

Still I hear the scream of thousands:
"Crucify, crucify!!!
Take it all
Our gold, our homes, our life,
But we didn't kill your Christ!!
Reach out for your holy grail
Enslave us and make us
Your god's sacrifice!!

Returning of the miracles
It's my own requiem
The jester's tears
They are inside me
Agony's the script for my requiem
Returning of the miracles
It's my own requiem
Is the script already written
Jester's tears I cry
Yes, I cry

[SOLO]

Still I'm confused
If I was dreaming
Too late I realized
I'd been another fool
I pay the price,
I pay the price.

Returning of the miracles
It's my own requiem
The jester's tears
They are inside me
Agony's the script for my requiem
Returning of the miracles
It's my own requiem
Is the script already written
Jester's tears I cry

5. Mordred's Song
I've lost my battle before it starts
My first breath wasn't done
My spirit's sunken deep
Into the ground
Why am I alone
I can hear my heartbeat
Silence's all around

See hate will rise
So don't come closer
Fear your child
Born with a king's heart
But fate fooled me
And changed my cards
No one asked if I want it
If I liked it

Pain inside is rising
I am the fallen one
A figure in an old game
No Joker's on my side
I plunged into misery
I'll turn off the light
And murder the dawn
Turn off the light
And murder the dawn

Nothing else
But laughter is around me
Forevermore
No one can heal me
Nothing can save me
I've gone beyond the truth
It's just another lie
Wash away the blood on my hands
My father's blood
In agony we're unified

I never wanted to be
What they told me to be
Fulfill my fate than I'll be free
God knows how long
I tried to change fate

[SOLO]

Pain inside is rising
I am the fallen one
A figure in an old game
No Joker's on my side
I plunged into misery
I'll turn off the light
And murder the dawn
Turn off the light
And murder the dawn

[SOLO]

I plunged into misery
I'll turn off the light
And murder the dawn
Turn off the light
And murder the dawn!!

6. Born In A Morning Hall
In fact it was close to a real fallout
Everything's under control
The speaker said with a serious smile
Behind his mask
He knew the truth
I'll bring new age of better ways
The TV preacher said
Just pay today
Pay today

World's dressed in black
On earth's judgments day
And I?
I know it can't go on
Forbidden signs increase
I'm sitting still at home
And watching

Born in a mourning hall
Pale clouds of feared the unborn child
Then it grew up with growing plans
Of suicide
Born in a mourning hall
Shadows left the fear inside
The Peter Pan will never reach
The other side

It's frightening
Exciting to sit at home
And watch the burning fields get
Hypnotized by the TV snake
Obey and work hard
And feel no anger

Just sympathy for the higher class
There's no chance in changing
Things
Cause I am

Born in a mourning hall
Silent cries ran out
When the cradle breaks
Broken dreams were unheard on
The other side
Born in a mourning hall
Shadows left the fear
In the new born child
The Peter Pan will never reach
The other side

[SOLO]

And I'm a part of a machine
A puppet on the strings
A rebel, once
Now I'm an old man

Oh, I know it can't go on
But the ghost called fear inside
Lames my tongue, my nerves,
My mind
Eternal fall down
Someone cut the strings off
I can't move
To get back courage
I've to face the truth
But not today
Goodbye

Born in a mourning hall
Caught inside a web called life
The only way to get out soon
I suicide
Born in a mourning hall
Pale souls built a frozen world
Infected brains
Will never reach the other side
The other side

7. Bright Eyes
Fool just another
Fool just another

I've been waiting
For signs of god
Create - enslave - behaved -
Everything is out of control

Leave me alone
Isolation bears hope
There's something else waiting
A promised destiny
Freezing me
I feel restless and low
These days full of sadness
Had joyfully changed
Into fear
My freakshow will start tonight
Don't miss the right time

Bright eyes
Blinded by fear of life
No Merlin is by my side

Everything is out of control
Everything is out of control
In my future plans
Everything is out of control
No one's left to hurt
Everything is out of control
Sorrow's gone away

Broken memories
Walking upstairs
Step by step
I see the whole world burning
The poet dies in Newerland
How it burns

Hey, mother stubborn
I really hate you
If you say yes I will say no
Ashes to ashes
But dust won't be dust
If you go there
I will go back

Bright eyes
Blinded by fear of life
Betrayed by sunrise
Bright eyes
Blinded by fear of life
No Merlin is by my side

Hey, father stubborn
You're ying
And I'm yang
I feel alone
Who really cares
Born into ashes
To lose all the games
With a smiling face

Bright eyes
Blinded by fear of life
And dark dragons rise
Bright eyes
Blinded by fear of life
No Merlin is by my side

So I sit still in my room, today
Winter's here
In summer season
Shall I say
I was wrong
If I'm right
Farewell to my last hope

8. Another Holy War
I am god
The only one
I will bring back
Freedom to your heart
You won't believe
That blind can't see
No one else before me ever knew
The way to paradise
For another bloody crime
I shall return

I am your light on through the night

Why am I born
Will I fail to rise again
Another Crucifixion for
Another holy war
Can't stop what's going on
[Repeat]

Sooner or later you must understand
My words bring freedom
And rescue for man
What else,
To call me your Messiah
Oh, I wish there could be another way
Cross and nails are already prepared

My sell out
Waits till I'm crucified
I will die before my vision ends

Why am I born
Will I fail to rise again
Another Crucifixion for
Another holy war
Can't stop what's going on

[SOLO]

Wait for the dawn
To take me away
What will be if I fail
Another golden calve
Never, never ending
Pain and agony
Hit me, nail me make me god

Why am I born
Will I fail to rise again
Another Crucifixion for
Another holy war
Can't stop what's going on
[Repeat]

9. And The Story Ends
And the story ends
Insanity said coldly
Still waiting for the chance
So out of nowhere it will rise
Oh, and another journey starts
By the call of the moon
Was it really me
I saw in the mirror screaming
I swallowed hate and lies
Through a thousand cries
Someone's sucking out my energy

What can I do
On this road to nowhere

Heart of dragon lies
At the edge of time

And the story ends
Insanity said coldly
Still waiting for the chance
So out of nowhere it will rise
Oh, and another journey starts
Into insanity's claws

Come with me and join me
A new life's waiting for you
Jump through the mirror
Leave fear behind
No matter where I tried
The candle light seemed
Lost forever
Before my vision fades
-cathedral
-falling tears

We're not alone
There's someone else, too
From the mirror's other side
Reflecting the cruel part of your soul
It's time for your choice

What can I do
On this road to nowhere

Heart of dragon lies
At the edge of time

And the story ends
Insanity said coldly
Still waiting for the chance
So out of nowhere it will rise
Oh, and another journey starts
By the call of the moon

[SOLO]

Heart of dragon lies

What can I do
On this road to nowhere

Heart of dragon lies
At the edge of time

And the story ends
Insanity said coldly
Still waiting for the chance
So out of nowhere it will rise
Oh, and another journey starts
Into sanity's claws

I'm not a king
I'm just a bard
How can I trust
If there is good and bad
The wounds of life
They will remain
At least I found a friend

1. War Of Wrath
[narrator (Sauron):]
The field is lost
Everything is lost
The black one has fallen from the sky and the towers in ruins lie
The enemy is within, everywhere
And with him the light, soon they will be here
Go now, my lord, while there is time
There are places below
[Morgoth:]
And you know them too
I release thee, go
My servant you'll be for all time
[Sauron:]
As you command
My king
[Morgoth:]
I had a part in everything
Twice I destroyed the light and twice I failed
I left ruin behind me when I returned
But I also carried ruin with me
She, the mistress of her own lust

2. Into The Storm
Give it to me
I must have it
Precious treasure
I deserve it

[bridge:]
Where can I run
How can I hide
The Silmarils
Gems of treelight
Their life belongs to me
Oh it's sweet how the
Darkness is floating around

[chorus:]
We are following
The will of the one
Through the dark age
And into the storm
And we are following
The will of the one
Through the dark age
And into the storm
Lord I'm mean

Blackheart show me
What you hold in your hand
I still hunger for more
Release me
From my pain
Give it to me
How I need it
How I need it
How I need it

[bridge]

[chorus]

I did my part
Now it's your turn
And remember
What you've promised

[bridge]

[chorus]

3. Lammoth

4. Nightfall
No sign of life did flicker
In floods of tears she cried
"All hope's lost it can't be undone
They're wasted and gone"

"Save me your speeches
I know (They blinded us all)
What you want
You will take it away from me
Take it and I know for sure
The light she once brought in
Is gone forevermore"

Like sorrowful seaguls they sang
"(We're) lost in the deep shades
The misty cloud brought
(A wailing when beauty was gone
Come take a look at the sky)
Monstrous it covered the shore
Fearful into the unknown"
Quietly it crept in new horror
Insanity reigned
And spilled the first blood
When the old king was slain

[chorus:]
Nightfall
Quietly crept in and changed us all
Nightfall
Quietly crept in and changed us all
Nightfall
Immortal land lies down in agony

"How long shall we
Mourn in the dark
the bliss and the beauty
Will not return
Say farewell to sadness and grief
Though long and hard the road may be"
But even in silence I heard the words
"An oath we shall swear
By the name of the one
Until the world's end
It can't be broken"

Just wondering how
I can still hear these voices inside

The doom of the Noldor drew near

The words of a banished king
"I swear revenge"
Filled with anger aflamed our hearts
Full of hate full of pride
We screamed for revenge

[chorus]

"Vala he is that's what you said
Then your oath's been sworn in vain
(But) freely you came and
You freely shall depart
(So) never trust the northern winds
Never turn your back on friends"

"Oh I'm heir of the high lord!"
"You better don't trust him"
The enemy of mine
Isn't he of your kind and
Finally you may follow me
Farewell
He said

[chorus]

Back to where it all began

5. The Minstrel
So I stand still
In front of the crowd
Excited faces
Whar will be next?
I still don't have a clue

6. The Curse Of Fëanor
Taken the long way
Dark realms I went through
I arrived
My vision's so clear
In anger and pain
I left deep wounds behind
But I arrived
Truth might be changed by victory

Beyond the void but deep within me
A swamp of filth exists
A lake it was of crystal beauty
But Arda's spring went by
I've heard the warning
Well curse my name
I'll keep on laughing
No regret
No regret

[chorus (1):]
Don't fear the eyes of the dark lord
Morgoth I cried
All hope is gone but I swear revenge
Hear my oath
I will take part in your damned fate

I will always remember their cries
Like a shadow which covers the light
I will always remember the time
But it's past
I cannot turn back the time
(I) don't look back
There's still smoke near the shore
But I arrived
Revenge be mine

[chorus (2):]
I will take part in your damned fate
Morgoth I cried
It's my oath
So don't fear the eyes
Of the dark lord

Soon you will be free
Set your spirit free
"Suddenly I realized
The prophecies
I've never believed in
My deeds were wrong
I've stained the land
And slain my kin
(Burning Soul)
There's no release from my sins
It hurts
THE CURSE OF FËANOR RUNS LONG
Time and only time will tell us
Tell: was I right or wrong?
When anger breaks through
I'll leave mercy behind"

[chorus (2)]

I will always remember their cries
Like a shadow they'll cover my life
But I'll also remember mine
(And) after all I'm still alive

7. Captured
[narrator (Morgoth):]
You are now my guest, forever

8. Blood Tears
Welcome to my realm
We are both condemned to live
It's a dark fate
(I can hear your calls
I can hear your calls)
THE ETERNAL LIFE

I see it still burns
Each night I cry in pain

Alive
Though the end appears my friend

[chorus:]
And blood tears I cry
You've searched and you've found
Cut off your old friends hand

My mind's
In frozen dreams
The rotten flesh
Of bitter lies
Welcome to where time stands still
Noone leaves and noone ever will

Can't hold it
It burns
Each night I cry in pain

[chorus:]
And blood tears I cry
Endless grief remained inside
And blood tears I cry
Endless grief remained inside

It seems so clearly
Bent the bow
Cause life in me is gone
And a cruel wind's blowing cold
And a cruel wind's blowing cold
In blame

And life it shall wane
Each night I cry in pain

[chorus:]
And blood tears I cry
Endless grief remained inside
Cut off your old friends hand

9. Mirror Mirror
Far, far beyond the island
We dwelt in shades of twilight
Through dread and weary days
Through grief and endless pain

It lies unknown
The land of mine
A hidden gate
To save us from the shadow fall
The lord of water spoke
In the silence
Words of wisdom
I've seen the end of all
Be aware the storm gets closer

[chorus (1):]
Mirror Mirror on the wall
True hope lies beyond the coast
You're a damned kind can't you see
That the winds will change
Mirror Mirror on the wall
True hope lies beyond the coast
You're a damned kind can't you see
That tomorrows bears insanity

Gone's the wisdom
Of a thousand years
A world in fire and chains and fear
Leads me to a place so far
Deep down it lies my secret vision
I better keep it safe

Shall I leave my friends alone
Hidden in my twilight hall
(I) know the world is lost in fire
Sure there is no way to turn it
Back to the old days
Of bliss and cheerful laughter
We're lost in barren lands
Caught in the running flames
Alone
How shall we leave the lost road
Time's getting short so follow me
A leader's task so clearly
To find a path out of the dark

[chorus (2):]
Mirror Mirror on the wall
True hope lies beyond the coast
You're a damned kind can't you see
That the winds will change
Mirror Mirror on the wall
True hope lies beyond the coast
You're a damned kind can't you see
That the winds will change

Even though
The storm calmed down
The bitter end
Is just a matter of time

Shall we dare the dragon
Merciless he's poisoning our hearts
Our hearts

How shall we leave the lost road
Time's getting short so follow me
A leader's task so clearly
To find a path out of the dark

[chorus (2)]

10. Face The Truth
[narrator:]
The moon, the sign of hope
It appeared when we left the pain of the ice-desert behind
We faced up to the curse and endured misery
Condemned we are
We brought hope, but also lies, and treachery

11. Noldor (Dead Winter Reigns)
Noldor
Blood is on your hands
Your bane's
A tearful destiny

Black clouds will carry
Rain of blood
I've seen it rain

We were lost
On grinding ice
In fear and hunger
Dead winter reigned
In Araman

[prebridge:]
(You) can't escape
From my damnation
(Nor) run away
From isolation

[bridge:]
Guilty spoke the one
THis deed can't be undone
Hear my words
Fear my curse

[chorus:]
I know where the stars glow
(And the) sky's unclouded
Sweet the water runs my friend
(But) Noldor
Blood is on your hands
Tears unnumbered
You will shet and dwell in pain

Your homeless souls
Shall come to me
There's no release
Slain you might be
Slain you will be
Slain you will be
And the lost
Who will not reach the
House of spirits
(Will) grow old and weary

[prebridge]

[bridge]

[chorus]

I've seen this bitter end
As I've foreseen
The storm and ice
And I could see it
(How) a million died
And I?
The blame's on me
Cause I was not there

[prebridge]

[bridge]

[chorus]

Dead winter reigns
And tomorrow's still unknown
Lies
Condemned and betrayed
Now everything is said
See my eyes
Are full of tears
And a cruel price
We've paid
But still I can't claim
That I'm innocent

Lost

12. Battle Of Sudden Flame
Oh lord here I stand
Suddely everything's gone
For all Noldor
From now on my life
Is my gift to you
Just lead my fate
To the victory
Of elves

13. Time Stands Still (At The Iron Hill)
Light fails at dawn
The moon is gone
And deadly the night reigns

Deceit

Finally I've found myself
In these lands
Horror and madness I've seen here
For what I became a king of the lost?
Barren and lifeless the land lies

[bridge:]
Lord of all Noldor
A star in the night
And a bearer of hope
He rides into his glorious battle alone
Farewell to the valiant warlord

[chorus (repeat 2x):]
The Fate of us all
Lies deep in the dark
When time stands still at the iron hill

I stand alone
Noone's by my side
I'll dare you
Come out
You coward
Now it's me or you

He gleams like a star
And the sound of his horn's
Like a raging storm
Proudly the high lord
Challenges the doom
Lord of slaves he cries

Slowly in fear
The dark lord appears
Welcome to my lands
You shall be damned

[bridge]

[chorus]

The iron crowned
Is getting closer
Swings his hammer
Down on him
Like a thunderstorm
He's crushing
Down the Noldor's
Proudest king

Under my foot
So hopeless it seems
You've troubled my day
Now feel the pain

[bridge]

[chorus]

The Elvenking's broken
He stumbles and falls
The most proud and most valiant
His spirit survives
Praise our king
Praise our king
Praise our king
Praise our king

14. The Dark Elf
A dark seed of evil is grown

15. Thorn
A black swan
Is born that night
The misty pond
(Has) got a new king
Got a new king
So what can we do
With our lives
When it all begins
It's hard and
It's cruel
Will grace die in pain?
Will light ever rise again?

I'm trapped in darkness
Still I reach out for the stars
I'm moving in silence
I leave it all far behind

[chorus:]
Oh at dawn
I'll face the edge of thorns
Oh at dawn
I'll pray at the edge of thorns
Oh at dawn
I'll face the edge of thorns

Let us march on
To the fields of sacrifice
(I'm) wondering why
I'll carry on
Will I betray myself
To rise

In the silence
It's time to explain
(And)
Search for truth in lies
Useful lies
Needless love's damned

What can we do with our lives
When it all begins

[chorus]

Come follow me
And you will see
How it will be
When all the pain is gone away

[chorus]

Let us march on
Though there's no hope at our side
Let us be brave
Though by glory we are denied
But
Don't you think
It's time for us
To bring to an end
Come play the song of death
The wisdom in us both
Will make it
Special guaranteed
Play the song of death

I'm lost in the depths of his eyes
I can't flee
Inner pain caused insanity
It's deep within
The fear and the hunger
Enslaved and denied
By my love and my enemies
I'm the illgotten son

[chorus]

16. The Eldar
I've seen the moon
And the first sunrise
I'll leave it to the memories
And kiss the wind goodbye

[chorus:]
For the Eldar
I'm trapped inside this dream
Of the Eldar's
Song of doom

I've tasted poison
When I drank the wine of fate
But the fear was in my heart
I realized too late
The house of spirits call

[chorus:]
For the Eldar
I'm trapped inside this dream
Of the Eldar's
Song of the doom

High's the fee
Soon my spirit will return
Welcome dawn
Your light will take me home

I say farewell

[chorus:]
To the Eldar
I'm trapped inside this dream
Of the Eldar's
Song of doom

17. Nom The Wise
[narrator (Beren?):]
Thus he died
Nom the Wise
Lord of the caves and friend of man
Fair, and noble
Most beloved of the Noldor race
Paid the price, he redeemed the oath
Farewell my friend, farewell

18. When Sorrow Sang
So let me out of it
Out of the cold
To bring back light and hope for all

And so if I could get you in
Just for a little while
Into the songs of sorrow
You might understand

Where am I now
Beyond the dawn
(Where) hope's turned to dust
At all

Immortal love's
Fooled by the hands of doom
That love means death
I realized too soon

[chorus:]
Caught in the afterlife
I've gone too far
When sorrow sang softly and sweet
The air was filled with tears
Full of sadness and grief
When sorrow sang softly and sweet

I feel like screaming
But I can't breath in
Shall I wane right now
I will not leave this
World of living
Till she has said
Goodbye

Out in the cold
I still wait for her call
And her last kiss
It shall be release
I can't forget her
Her face will not leave
From the depths of my soul
I long for her

So I heard all about it
Her voice's so clear
She's woven both themes in there
Moved me to tears
The world shall hear this sad song
Song of sorrow song of grief
Can't change the way of his kind
Can't change the way of her kind

[chorus]

19. Out On The Water
Out on the water
The island of the dead that live
There they dwelt
Until they left the world and
Still their deeds live forth in songs

20. The Steadfast
[narrator (Morgoth):]
Now truly I am king of the world
Master of fate
Damned shall thy house be
Thou shall not question my power
Nor shall thou defy me further

21. A Dark Passage
I feel cold
Facing the darkness
The light's gone away
Deep in his castle he said
All land'll be mine
There's one thing for sure
The triumph of shadow is near
Deep in his castle they sang
We shall not rest
Until all will be thyne

All land is mine
You can be sure
Don't dare me
the mighty one screamed

[chorus:]
Smashed down the light
I will not rest till I'm king
Valinor's empty now
allied the elves and men
they shall be damned

Rise of Fall
a dark tale ends

just wondering how
in the darkness
they found their way
to the right place
children of the sun
second kindred
we call their race
treat them kindly
born in the east
(are the) nightfearer
they moved westwards
towards the sunshine
(they are) morning breath like
short's their life
(like) dawn passes by
when the day comes
the field was lost
(and) hope had passed away
the sun went down
beyond the sea
dark was the hour
but day shall come again

[chorus]

Clean my wounds
wash away all fear
let courage be mine
noone hears me crying

no song no tale
which contains all the grief
(but)
renowned the deeds
and the victims of defeat

sit down on your chair
and look out for your kin
with my eyes you'll see
and with my ears you'll hear
you troubled my day
and you've questioned my strength
(but) don't mess
with the master of fate

[chorus]

I smashed down the light
and dared Valinor
I smashed down the light
revenge will be mine

Slowly marching on
still we're marching on

22. Final Chapter (Thus Ends...)
[narrator:]
Thus ends the fifth battle
By the treachery of men the field is lost
The night falls and great is the triumph of evil
The league is broken
The last vestige of hope lives in the hidden king
Only he troubles the dark one's mind
Only he could bring ruin to the black foe
Though the land lies down in agony and the curse lives on
A new star shall arise
And a new day shall come, again

BLIND GUARDIAN LYRICS


1. Don't Talk To Strangers
[tribute to Ronnie James Dio]

Don't talk to strangers
'cause they're only there to do you harm
Don't write in starlight
'cause the words may come out real
Don't hide in doorways
You may find the key that opens up your soul
Don't go to heaven 'cause it's really only hell
Don't smell the flowers
They're an evil drug to make you lose your mind
Don't dream of women
'cause they'll only bring you down

Hey you, you know me
You've touched me, but I'm real
I'm forever the one who lets you look and see
Can You feel me? I'm danger - I'm a stranger
And I
I'm darkness, I'm anger, I'm pain
I am the master
The evil song you sing inside your brain, drive you insane
Don't talk
Don't let them inside your mind yeah
Run away, run away go
Don't let them in your mind, touch your soul

Don't dance in darkness
You may stumble and you're sure to fall
Don't write in starlight
'cause the words may come out real

Don't talk to strangers
'cause they're only there to make you sad
Don't dream of women
'cause they'll only bring you down

Run away

1. Precious Jerusalem
No doubt, doubt

No longer need to hide it
I've found out who I am
I'm moved around in circles
I rise and fall again

I know it well
Every word I tell
Seems to make no sense at all

Words
Will heal it
Love
Will conquer the
Hearts of the hopeless the almighty is still alive

Risin' up from the heart of the desert
Risin' up from Jerusalem
Risin' up from the heat of the desert
Building up old Jerusalem
Risin' up from the heart of the desert
Risin' up from Jerusalem
Risin' up from the heat of the desert
Heading out for Jerusalem

I've gone beyond but there's no life
And there is nothing how it seems
I've gone beyond but there's no life
There is no healing rain in Eden
The empty barren wasted paradise
Let's celebrate the dawning of the Sun

I turn to you oh my precious Jerusalem
Deny your prophets their passion and treat them like fools
I turn to you oh my poor old Jerusalem
Deny my love but you can't change fate

Son of man
(You truly are mine)

Can't stand the pain
No more grief and misery
It goes on and on and on and on and on and on and on

Father stop it now
We must stop it now

You really think you are half way up
I would not mind if you were right
(It's not sure)
I'd rather say you are half way down
So I am going to help you if I can

I've been caught in wilderness in wilderness
I've get out well
I found myself in desert lands in desert lands
But you've been on my mind

I turn to you oh my precious Jerusalem
Deny your prophets their passion and treat them like fools
I turn to you oh my poor old Jerusalem
Deny my love but you can't change truth

Rise up and follow me cause I will bring the light
Rise up and follow me wake up and clear your mind
I try to bring it back the seed of life
I try to bring it back the seal of light

So if you say there's no faith in man
You better keep in mind
That I can read between the lines
My heavy burden brings eyesight to the blind

I've been caught in wilderness in wilderness
I've get out well
I found myself in desert lands in desert lands
But you've been on my mind

I turn to you oh my precious Jerusalem
Deny your prophets their passion and treat them like fools
I turn to you oh my poor old Jerusalem
Deny my love but you can't change me

2. Battlefield
It cannot be seen but there's blood on the green
Only God knows I'm innocent
Take me, take me home
A dark seed reigns in me like the Storm rules over the sea
I challenge thee, do not cross this bridge alone

Don't dare me now
The threatening shadows will pass by

They're getting closer now
Open your eyes
Wake up my dear young friend
And hate shall fade away

I will not move, yet
I'll stand still instead

There on the battlefield he stands
Down on the battlefield he's lost
And on the battlefield it ends

War and anger shall reign
The clash of iron can be heard
By blindness you're driven insane
I'm lost in anguish and grief
Sorrow won't wane 'til you die
A shattered body deeply hurt
And darkness will cover the light
It's gone forevermore

The field's been left in sorrow
The father and the son they're gone
The Sun shines bright and anger rises
Lorn and lonely torn apart
Don't you think it's time to stop now
We were charmed and fooled by the old serpent's kiss

Let's pray that heaven is on our side
Through violence and horror shall honour arise
So let's pray and blessed shall be our leader
We follow the noble and bright

Don't you hear me crying, crying
Come take me away
I hallow thy name

There on the battlefield he stands
Down on the battlefield he's lost
And on the battlefield it ends

War and anger shall reign
The clash of iron can be heard
By blindness you're driven insane
I'm lost in anguish and grief
Sorrow won't wane 'til you die
A shattered body deeply hurt
And darkness will cover the light
It's gone forevermore

That's what the minstrel sing
Join in the horrible screams
Take part in murderous deeds
Renowned be the lion-hearted

Join in the minstrelsy
Wailing in endless grief
It eagerly longs for more
Broken bodies lay down on the ground

Blood sheds all over the place
The green will be stained forever
And hate reigns all over the field
They keep struggling on in anger

Fiercely intense outrageous, too blind to see
And in pain they keep on singing
We claim the land for the highlord
God bless the land and our highlord

War and anger shall reign
The clash of iron can be heard
By blindness you're driven insane
I'm lost in anguish and grief
Sorrow won't wane 'til you die
A shattered body deeply hurt
And darkness will cover the light
It's gone forevermore

3. Under The Ice
Run
'Til you find the answer
Time out
For our poor Cassandra
She's fairly safe inside the fire

Inside the fire
Awakes desire
Cruelly admired

They'll torture her soul
And they'll torment her heart
But won't change her mind

Would you like to see me
How I'll cut off
Her head life's a game
A lesson to learn
Don't be shy just blame me
Well, there is no
Need to feel ashamed
Remember the oath
Remember the oath

Wake up
It's time to cross the border
Is it true what they say
About the part you've played?

Enjoy your stay here
Welcome to the slaughterhouse

Release from rotten thoughts
No more pain
And no more gods

Under the ice you will believe
Under the ice you will be free
Released from rotten thoughts
No more pain
And no more gods

Please understand
It's not in our hands
Barren the land
It's all dead and gone

And still the tyrant's face is red
So witness my glory, my triumph, my fame
It's the sweetest taste

King of terror just stop wining
Hold your breath it won't take long
Realize this is your judgement day
In between the killing carry on

There are no rules here
Welcome to the slaughterhouse

Release from rotten thoughts
No more pain
And no more gods

Under the ice you will believe
Under the ice you will be free
Released from rotten thoughts
No more pain
And no more gods

Try to understand

You're the artificial enemy
An illusion we all need
For our sake
For our sake

We're not allowed to see beyond that's your skill
Will we ever learn the lesson "We can't fly with broken wings"

Break the chains
Time to change
I'm afraid to say but you won't play a part

It's been nice we now get to the climax
Your destination's unknown
Just get out of my way

Don't mind the blood here
Welcome to the slaughterhouse

Release from rotten thoughts
No more pain
And no more gods

Under the ice you will believe
Under the ice you will be free
Released from rotten thoughts
No more pain
And no more gods

Under the ice you will be free
Released from rotten thoughts
No more pain
And no more gods
And no more gods
(No more gods)

I'm afraid to say but you won't play a part

4. Sadly Sings Destiny
A wooden cup and a crown of thorns
Will set up the stage for the cross
I rent a room next door
There is nothing more
No further voices to hear
I'll be free

It doesn't matter anymore that someone's knocking at my door
I've known it long before the Galilean's on the floor
Shame on me, shame on me
I'm a tool and nothing more

I can feel it's getting nearer
Images they'll turn out clearer
Creeps in and out of your mind
I'm destiny personified
I know there's something more behind
But is it really justified
To sacrifice, to crucify
The rescue of the human kind

Sadly sings destiny
Sadly sings destiny
"For ages I've been waiting
Now spring is in the air
Let it in"
Sadly sings destiny
Sadly sings destiny
"For ages I've been waiting
Now spring is in the air
Let it in"

I hear them howling hear them scream
The raging mob turns mad it seems
"The king's in town
We need a crown"
I think we all know how it ends

"So we're not going take it longer"
So all I know is I don't care
"So we're not going take it longer"
Now we are aware

I can feel it's getting nearer
Images they'll turn out clearer
Creeps in and out of your mind
I'm destiny personified
I know there's something more behind
But is it really justified
To sacrifice, to crucify
The rescue of the human kind

Sadly sings destiny
Sadly sings destiny
"For ages I've been waiting
Now spring is in the air
Let it in"
Sadly sings destiny
Sadly sings destiny
"For ages I've been waiting
Now spring is in the air
Let it in"

There I tie the ass
There I tie the colt
Begging for a last chance I hear the voices say
"We get him home tonight and that's all you need to know"
I'm alone

So I can't stand it any longer
And don't want to see it all
Nazarene, your vision will come true
Will come true
They'll get you

I can feel it's getting nearer
Images they'll turn out clearer
Creeps in and out of your mind
I'm destiny personified
I know there's something more behind
But is it really justified
To sacrifice, to crucify
The rescue of the human kind

Sadly sings destiny
Sadly sings destiny
"For ages I've been waiting
Now spring is in the air
Let it in"
Sadly sings destiny
Sadly sings destiny
"For ages I've been waiting
Now spring is in the air
Let it in"

5. The Maiden And The Minstrel Knight
The faithful crowd is gathered here
Soon they'll appear
The high and mighty show up the king
Is in doubts
"Apart from this beggar here
There's no one like you my dear
Tasting my lips
No one but you and him"

Round the fire everyone should sing
And praise the gracious queen
Round the fire everyone should dance
And we praise the handsome knight

Forever and ever we both will be one
The maiden, the fair and the young
Fell in love

Will you still wait for me?
Will you still cry for me?
Come and take my hand
Will you still wait for me?
Will you still cry for me?
Come and take my hand

There's a moment in life when all the years will pass by
And the eyes filled with tears we once shed
We recognize failures, the desperate cries
Of the ones who believed in our lies

Whenever I'll go you'll be with me
My first though and my last
Though we'll depart in bitterness
One day you'll understand

Carry on
Beloved maiden, mine
Carry on
Or we have to pay the price

Will you still wait for me?
Will you still cry for me?
Come and take my hand
Will you still wait for me?
Will you still cry for me?
Come and take my hand

Yesterday's memories and melodies
Are gone with the wind, so sad
Snow-white her hands and golden her hair
But she's not the one
Out in the emptiness where everything's pale
There is no sign of you, I'm alone
How I wish you would be here, I'm alone
Telling me it's alright, come rest (your head)
Come rest your head
Come rest your head
Come rest your head
Come rest your head

I'm alone and sadness reigns in my heart
As long as we live it won't go away
We are one but torn apart

Will you still wait for me?
Will you still cry for me?
Come and take my hand
Will you still wait for me?
Will you still cry for me?
Come and take my hand

Proudly it stands
Until the world's end
The victorious banner of love

6. Wait For An Answer
I cannot say that I don't care cause I'm aware
Of everyone and everything they're everywhere

Don't be a fool
Stop spinning around
(Spinning around)
You're right it ain't safe here
Start using your brain, your brain

The cautious hare cannot be seen as a coward
He's simply aware
(He constantly) knows what's going on
That the wheel of life turns on
It won't hold on

Silent creature, filthy teacher's
Spreading the disease, a release
A vanished kingdom falls

It goes on, on and on and again
It goes on, round and round
Oh I can't get it out of my head

Wish I'd be a bird of prey
A pure and a blessed
A hawk who could ease the pain

Don't look back tell me
Is it where you belong
A place in the dark
A song without hope
Don't look back tell me
Is it where you (belong)
Oh I wait for an answer so far
Don't look back tell me
Is it where you (belong)
I will wait for an answer so far
Don't look back tell me
Is it where you (belong)
I will wait yes I will wait
Don't look back

We're the last descendants
In the line of valiant soldiers
We're mistreated angels
We are the blackbird nation, we're the chosen ones
We're the last descendants
We're the tribe of unsung glory
We are the fallen angels
Well the time is right you shall be on my (side)

I don't I don't I don't need anyone
Be with or be against me
I'm white I am chosen
There is not the slightest doubt at all
Not at all

In lower airs we're ground down by their ignorance

Hate will grow like a foul cancer
To find a foe seems to be the answer
Round and round it goes on and again oh
I can't get it out of my head

Wish I'd be a bird of prey
A pure and a blessed
A hawk who could ease the pain

Don't look back tell me
Is it where you belong
A place in the dark
A song without hope
Don't look back tell me
Is it where you (belong)
Oh I wait for an answer so far
Don't look back tell me
Is it where you (belong)
I will wait for an answer so far
Don't look back tell me
Is it where you (belong)
I will wait yes I will wait
Don't look back

Don't be a fool
Stop spinning around
(Spinning around)
Don't move it ain't safe here
They've stained holy grounds
Oh no

The hopeful he sadly admits there's no hero
No place to hide there is no shelter from the storm
The maddened crow will spread terror
But I know bitterly they will stumble
Find themselves smashed on the ground

Don't look back tell me
Is it where you belong
A place in the dark
A song without hope
Don't look back tell me
Is it where you (belong)
Oh I wait for an answer so far
Don't look back tell me
Is it where you (belong)
I will wait for an answer so far
Don't look back tell me
Is it where you (belong)
I will wait yes I will wait
Don't look back

It's you who has said there's no tomorrow
I don't know but who I am
I wouldn't sit back any longer
It's surely built in sadness
But the sadness surely will go by
So we will all know the answer
The answer's within, it's in your mind

7. The Soulforged
I'm not insane
That's how it seems though
Spiteful, cruel but wise beyond his age

My body fails
My soul will (rise)
The end of life's immortalized
Disease and agony
And I see death through golden eyes
(Beyond the door)
There's something more
It seems there's just one way

On through the heat
I've felt the touch of evil
I still feel
The icy claw in me

For a descent price I've banned kindness from my heart
The spirit of all truth and beauty pawned for my desire

And from the flames
As chance would have it
The Soulforged will come into light
And from the flames
As chance would have it
The Soulforged, the stainless will rise

I will never change my mind
I will leave it all behind

And through the hour glass
Everything's grey, everyone's pale
Nor colour nor beauty will enlighten my heart
The seat of life's empty and cold

Cadaverous you all seem to me
Stillborn but you're still alive
You're still alive

Truth lies in loneliness
When hope is long gone by
I'll wipe out the bliss of the new age
And welcome you precious night

And from the flames
As chance would have it
The Soulforged will come into light
And from the flames
As chance would have it
The Soulforged, the stainless will rise

>From a distant time voices echo in the hall
"Come and join us, enter life and everything is gone now"

And through the looking glass
I still fear mortality and
Its loss in the end
(Unlimited) power in my hands
("Mourn for his lost soul
He's cursed and condemned")
The claw of the dragon ascends

Each step I take mMay it hurt may It ache
Leads me further away from the past
But as long as I breathe (and) each smile on my bleak face
I'm on my way to find back to the Peace of mind

And from the flames
As chance would have it
The Soulforged will come into light
And from the flames
As chance would have it
The Soulforged, the stainless will rise

I will never change my mind
I will leave it all behind

8. Age Of False Innocence
Cut off the light, take a look
There's nothing beyond but pain
Suffer in the deepest void
The flame of hope is gone
What have I done?
Denied the father and the son
For a moment it seemed
There's space beyond the spheres

Aflame the night
So clear and bright
Unstable light
(You've been sacrificed in fear)
Now there's one thing for sure
I'm not afraid anymore

Day after day we've been fixed in this bowl for so long
For ages we're captured in shells and crystallized walls

Predestined or punished? By Man or God?

I cannot, I will not
Deny It's false innocence
I cannot, I will not
The age of false innocence
(Take it away from me)

(And) for a while astronomy has moved the Earth
And we've turned around the Sun
(Sanctum Officium)
Has made me believe
Has made me believe
Has made me believe

"We know for sure you're lying
Would you like to mess with holy science
You know the fear of dying
Would it be worth it to hear you crying"
I've slaughtered truth and I've shattered my heart

Far too long I have played with hellfire
And science has turned into madness
But I should have taken it higher
So I feel, so I feel
Like Judas must have felt before
That Wednesday night near by the tree

I cannot, I will not
Deny It's false innocence
I cannot, I will not
The age of false innocence
(Take It away from me)

Day after day we will gratefully suffer for more
Predestined's our part so we bleed in the name of God

Don't believe in their eternity
We're still held in blindness
And I've been turned into a liar
If there is no heaven there won't be release

I cannot, I will not
Deny It's false innocence
(I cannot) I will not
The age of false innocence
(I cannot) I will not
Deny It's false innocence
(I cannot) I will not
The age of false innocence
(Take It away from me)

9. Punishment Divine
It's warm and tender but very soon it will turn cold
Shadows stare down from the walls
Out of the mist it's coming closer now
It never rains -- it pours on me
So let the saints
Set up the courtyard, the unpleasant cage
The obvious point is I'm insane

Was I aware whom I has slain, I fear I was:
The faceless
The nameless
The bush set on fire
No one ever dared to speak
"Shame on me, I don't believe
The here and now Is all we're living for"

Joyful it seems but
Then suddenly
By one false move it's blown away
Joyful it seems but
Then suddenly
Their voices cease it's gone away
Vanished to the point of no return
Vanished to the point of no return

Witness my last breath
I do not regret
A word I've said
The strong will survive
The weak must die

And out of the mist
It's coming closer now
Sinner and saints --
The grateful slaves

Nature's law instead of God in heaven

From far beyond
I can hear them sing
I hear angels sing
Songs of innocence
I hear the angel sing

Despite the facts are clear
It cannot be, what we can't see
I must admit, it sounds so sweet

Joyful it seems but
Then suddenly
By one false move it's blown away
Joyful it seems but
Then suddenly
Their voices cease it's gone away
Vanished to the point of no return
Vanished to the point of no return

Angels sing
(Can hear them sing)
I hear angels sing
I hear angels sing
(Can hear them sing)
I hear angels sing
I hear angels sing
(Can hear them sing)
I hear angels sing
I hear angels sing
I hear angels sing

Far beyond I hear them sing
("It's true) it's true
We don't exist"
From far beyond I hear them sing
("It's true) it's true
We don't exist"

Well we all know there's no other side
It's good and evil
I know right between, there's no borderline
This is the punishment divine

Surrounded by night, I've been offered insight
There is none but the sin of pride
Am I wrong am I right? Am I losing my sight?
Abandoning the superior mind

Joyful it seems but
Then suddenly
By one false move it's blown away
Joyful it seems but
Then suddenly
Their voices cease it's gone away
Vanished to the point of no return
Vanished to the point of no return

(Right away)
Through the valleys grey
(I will be gone)
Through the shapeless land I walk alone
(I will be gone)
I'm left alone
(I will be gone)
Through the deepest void, a blackened paradise
(I will be gone)
I walk alone, I'm left alone

10. And Then There Was Silence
Turn your head and see the fields of flames

(Don't move along)
He carries along
(Cause things they will go wrong)
>From a distant place
(The end is getting closer)
He's on his way
(Day by day)
He'll bring decay
In shades of grey
We're doomed to face the night
Light's out of sight

Since we've reached the point of no return
We pray for the starlight we wait for the Moon
The sky is empty, alone in the unknown
we're getting nowhere

We have been betrayed by the wind and the rain
The sacred hall's empty and cold
The sacrifice made should not be done in vain
Revenge will be taken by Rome

We live a lie
Under the dying moon
Pale-faced laughs doom
Indulges in delight

It's getting out of hand
The final curtain will fall

Hear my voice
There is no choice
There's no way out
You'll find out

We don't regret it
So many men have failed but now he's (gone)
Go out and get it
The madman's head it shall be thine
We don't regret it
That someone else dies hidden in (disguise)
Go out and get it
Orion's hound shines bright

Don't you think it's time to stop the chase
Around the ring
Just stop running, running
Round the ring
Don't you know that fate has been decided
By the gods
Feel the distance, distance
Out of reach

Welcome to the end
Watch your step, Cassandra, you may fall
As I've stumbled on the field
Find myself in darkest places
(Sister mine)
Find myself drifting away
(Death's a certain thing)
And the other world
The other world appears

Find myself she dies in vain

I cannot be freed, I'm falling down
As time runs faster, moves towards disaster
The ferryman will wait for you, my dear

And then there was silence
Just a voice from the other world
Like a leaf in an icy world
Memories will fade

Misty tales and Poems lost
All the bliss and beauty
Will be gone
Will my weary soul find release for a while
At the moment of death I will smile
It's the triumph of shame and disease

In the end (Iliad)
Raise my hands and praise the day
Break the spell show me the (way)
In decay
The flame of Troy will shine bright

The newborn child will carry ruin to the hall
The newborn's death would be a blessing to us all

Good choice?
Bad choice?
Out of three you've chosen misery

Power and wisdom you deny
(Bad choice, bad choice)

War is the only answer when Love will conquer fear

So the judgement's been made
To the fairest the graceful says
Badly he fails

(Warning)
Fear the heat of passion, father king
(Don't let him in
Don't let her in)
Desire, lust, obsession
Death they'll bring
(We can't get out
Once they are in)

She's like the sunrise
Outshines the Moon at night
Precious like starlight
She will bring in a murderous price

(In darkness grows the seed of man's defeat)
Jealousy
(I can clearly see the end now)
I can clearly see the end now
I can clearly see the end now

(The thread of life is spun)
The coin's been placed below my tongue

Never give up
Never give in
Be on our side so we can win
Never give up
Never give in
Be on out side
(Old moon's time) is soon to come

Nowhere to run
Nowhere to hide
Nothing to lose like one we'll stand
We'll face the storm
Created by a man

Roar Roar Roar Roar
Troy (Troy Troy Troy)
And as the lion slaughters man
I am the wolf and you're the lamb

(Hallowed) Troy will fall round the walls
Faith is shattered, bodies fall

Nowhere to run
Nowhere to hide
Nothing to lose like one we'll stand
It's all for one and one for all
We live for will be wiped out

I feel that something's (wrong)
Surprise, surprise they're gone

Full moon your time goes by
And new moon's still kept out of sight
We live
Misty tales and Poems lost
(We die)
All the bliss and beauty will be gone

Will my weary soul find release for a while
At the moment of death I will smile
It's the triumph of shame and disease

In the end (Iliad)
Raise my hands and praise the day
Break the spell show me the (way)
In decay
The flame of Troy will shine bright

Roam in darkness
(Spread the vision)
Roam in darkness
(Spread the vision)
Roam in darkness
(Spread the vision)
Roam in darkness
(Spread the vision)
(Roam in darkness)
(We will be lost if you truly believe)
(Roam in darkness)
Troy in darkness
(There's a cold emptiness in our hearts)
That they've gone away
(And) won't come back

They'll tear down the wall to bring it in
They'll truly believe in the lie
Lie, lie

With blossoms they'll welcome the old foe

The vision's so clear
When day and dream unite the end is near
You better be prepared

The nightmare shall be over now, there's nothing more to fear
Come join in our singing and dance with us now
The nightmare shall be over now, there's nothing more to fear
The war it is over forevermore

No hope
The blind leads the blind
Carry on
Though future's denied

Mare or stallion
There's far more inside
We are in at the kill we'll cheerfully die

Misty tales and Poems lost
All the bliss and beauty
Will be gone
(Will) my weary soul find release for a while
At the moment of death I will smile
It's the triumph of shame and disease

In the end (Iliad)
Raise my hands and praise the day
Break the spell show me the (way)
In decay
The flame of Troy will shine bright

Holy light shines on

So the judgement's been made
We're condemned though the trial's far ahead

The crack of doom, Father
Your handsome son is heading home

Still the wind blows, calm and silent
Carries news from a distant shore
Still the wind blows, calm and silent
Carries news from a distant shore
Still the wind blows, calm and silent
(Out of mind)
Carries news from a distant shore
(Can't get it)
(Still the wind blows, calm and silent)
(Out of mind)
(Carries news from a distant shore)
(Can't get it out of my head)
(Can't get it)
(Out of mind)
(Can't get it out of my head)

Sorrow and defeat
Sorrow and defeat

11. Mies Del Dolor
[Spanish bonus track]

Ella partió
Y el bosque durmió  
La doncella nunca volverá  

El sello del olvido se ha roto  
Y en pecado un amor tornará  

Nuestra vida sola baila  
Esperanza gritos cubrirá  
La verdad en el pasado  
Sueños mentiras mostrarán  
La noche vendrá  
Dolor quedará  

De repente todo se aclaró  
La venda de los ojos cayó  

Sus ojos cerró  
Y mi nombre gritó  
Ella nunca nunca mas fue vuelta  
A ver  

Mies del dolor  
Tu fruto creció  
En helada tierra de pesar  
Cuando muera la luz  
La noche invernal  
Vendrá  

Ella partió  
Y yo pierdo la fe  
Mis heridas no podrán sanar  

Traeré al ocaso  
Pese a que seré burlado yo  
Por la vida y el juicio final  

Amanece en la vida y sé  
Que pronto todo pasará  
Y enfrento las sombras de pie en soledad  

Mies del dolor  
Tu fruto creció  
En helada tierra de pesar  
Cuando muera la luz  
La noche invernal  
Vendrá

12. Harvest Of Sorrow
[Japanese bonus track]

She is gone leaves are falling down
The tear maiden will not return
The seal of oblivion is broken
And a pure love's been turned into sin

At the dawn of our living time
Hope may cover all cries
Truth lurks hidden in the shadows
Dreams might be filled with lies
Soon there will be night
Pain remains inside

Suddenly (oh) it seemed so clear
All the blindness was taken away
She closed her eyes and she called out my name
She was never ever never ever seen again

Harvest of sorrow, your seed is grown
In a frozen world full of cries
When the ray of light shrinks
Shall cold winter nights begin

She is gone and I fall from grace
No healing charm covers my wounds
Fooled's the dawn and so I am
Fooled by life and a bitter doom
To bring you the end of the day

At the dawn of our living time
Hope it soon will pass by
Facing a darkness
I stand (alone)

Harvest of sorrow, your seed is grown
In a frozen world full of cries
When the ray of light shrinks
Shall cold winter nights begin

1. Another Stranger Me
A seed of doubt
It exists
And it grows
A glimpse of life
From somewhere deep within
Awake and understand

Is there anyone else here?
Somebody's screaming
Please help me
Let's find out now
That I am not dreaming
Welcome to my damnation
Here it comes the real me

I didn't know
I couldn't hear the answer
My mind was blank
I should've known
I hold it back but somehow
There is someone else
Another stranger me
Another stranger me

That's
When the ice
Will break away

I can't get out of here
Anymore
Cause none of my keys
Fit the door

There's fear and anger
Hate and love
I must confess
It's out of hand

It's physic
It's cynic
Still cynic
All my laughter

It's cynic
Just manic
It's cynic
All her laughter

If there's anyone in
It soon will be over
We'll burn out
Our soul's aflamed
And we're on our own now
Give up you cruel invasion
You're insane I'll show you

I didn't know
I couldn't hear the answer
My mind was blank
I should've known
I hold it back but somehow
There is someone else
Another stranger me
Another stranger me

Out and gone
Can't resist
Cold and sore
The bolt of pain
Keeps ripping through my head
I can take no more

Don't tell anyone else but I
Do not believe her
She hates me
I cloud my mind
She's a deceiver
I can feel cruel vibrations
Would you like to meet me

I didn't know
I couldn't hear the answer
My mind was blank
I should've known
I hold it back but somehow
There is someone else
Another stranger me
Another stranger me

2. All The King's Horses
I can feel I'm one
With the tortured land
With its solitude and decay
There's no one left
All the other men
Pass on through the night

All dead and gone
Still I don't dare to move
The imprisoned soul
Cannot find back home

Snow falls down
It covers field and blood
Snow falls down
And clears the view

It is cold

And once again
The battle's fought
Out on the plains
So rhymes spread out its glory
But
No rhyme defines its pain

I can't recall all their names
Connection broke loose
They've crossed the lake
Reach the other side
And leave me alone
With the truth

All the king's horses
And all the king's men
They've failed to damn the flood
They've failed to find the grail
Talisien, old friend of mine
Sing my song

Then once again
The battle's lost
I am to blame
Snow falls down
All dead and gone
They all are dead and gone
They've turned to dust
They've sealed the past
A long long time ago

I can't recall all their names
Connection broke loose
They've crossed the lake
Reach the other side
And leave me alone
With the truth

I can't recall all their names
Connection broke loose
They've crossed the lake
Reach the other side
And leave me alone
With the truth

3. Dream A Little Dream Of Me
Stars shining bright above you
Night breezes seem to whisper "i love you"
Birds singin' in the sycamore trees
Dream a little dream of me

Say nighty-night and kiss me
Just hold me tight and tell me you'll miss me
While I'm alone and blue as can be
Dream a little dream of me

Stars fading but I linger on dear
Still craving your kiss
I'm longin' to linger till dawn dear
Just saying this

Sweet dreams till sunbeams find you
Sweet dreams that leave all worries behind you
But in your dreams whatever they be
Dream a little dream of me

Stars shining up above you
Night breezes seem to whisper "i love you"
Birds singin' in the sycamore trees
Dream a little dream of me

Sweet dreams till sunbeams find you
Sweet dreams that leave all worries behind you
But in your dreams whatever they be
Dream a little dream of me

Yes, dream a little dream of me

4. Lionheart (Demo Version)
Just let me out of here
Speak to me
It all would be easier
I want to talk to you
Who is that?
Do I hear a whisper?
Or do I hear a cry?
Across the brown land
The stumps of time

Oh turn the wheel and heal me
Since moonlights fade
I'm empty - heal me

I'm in search of the Lionheart
I am ashamed
I myself can't make it
Drown Ulysses
Drown here in the silence
Cause down to Hades I've gone
But I cannot get out

Down below
I can't free my mind
Soon I will fade away
Down below
I can't free my mind
Soon I will fade

"Tic Tac" is the message
And the lunatic fears
He is no more

Speak to me
It all would be easier
While I'm passing by
What's that?
Do I hear a whisper?
Or do I hear a cry?
Across the brown land
The ghost arrives

Pick up my bones and
Tell me
Is this the "Lake of Fire"?
Hell?
Please

I'm in search of the Lionheart
Nobody else
But the pure can save me
Drown Ulysses
Drown here in the silence
Cause down to Hades I've gone
But I cannot get out

Ruins rule my memories
I can't recall the signs
Invite the dead
Then silence struck my mind

Silence is madness
"Tic Tac Tic Tactic"
Says the clock

Just let me out of here
Speak to me
It all would be easier
I want to talk to you
Hear me

Welcome to this sad place
And hand me what is mine
I'm the Theban prophet
The dead and blind

And from the sea you'll feel me
Then you'll breath out gently
Leave me

I'm in search of the Lionheart
I am ashamed
I myself can't make it
Drown Ulysses
Drown here in the silence
Cause down to Hades I've gone
But I cannot get out

5. The Edge (Demo Version)
The world turned innocent
Can you hear me?
I confess I'm no redeemer
Can you hear me?
What shall I do?

I witnessed everything
Faith won't leave me
Mind my tongue
It's like a fire
Faith don't leave me
Glow into words

This is the edge now
It's all we're living for
Rain on me
Love you will rain on me
And at the end I
Boast in the cross
And now
Love reigns -
The god incarnation
I've shaped

Out there is a world on fire

Accursed the hanged one
Divine love for free
What a fateful night
And a grateful life
The choir echoes
"Every man his price"

Price
Light my agony
And crucify me
Void the law
At the ninth hour
Void the law
At the ninth hour

This is the edge now
It's all we're living for
Rain on me
Love you will rain on me
And at the end I
Boast in the cross
And now
Love reigns -
The god incarnation
I've shaped

The world turns flesh again
Mystified are the final hours
No more fear in
No more fear in

Passover
The brook
Time it is at hand
Obscure the facts
A passion play

This is the edge now
It's all we're living for
Rain on me
Love you will rain on me
And at the end I
Boast in the cross
And now
Love reigns -
The god incarnation
I've shaped

Hallowed be thy name
Hallowed be thy name

No more fear in ...

Come take a look
The old symbols they move
Wounds still bleed
That's creed
No more fear in ...
Can you see me?
Come take a look
At the depth of my soul

1. This Will Never End
Once upon a time
No more words to say
Find me in the circle
Find me in the end

I am the soul collector
Dressed in ebony,
There are no rules
But only one

There's someone young sister,
Caught in the border
Let's get in contact
By the laws of mine

I have told
That this will never end (this will never end)
Things go on
But nothing will last,
Only the fool in me believes
There is sense in it.
In distant shores of grief
It's over now!

Far out in space
I ride on,
Time is chasing us all,
It's not quite how it seems,
It's just a dream.

I don't believe
In a soul out of god
It's just twisted!
Fellow
You do not understand.

Each single breath inspires
you to come to an end - expire.

Rise up my sister
Let's cross the border,
Reveal the secret
One more soul to burn

I have told
That this will never end (this will never end)
Things go on
But nothing will last,
Only the fool in me believes
There is sense in it.
In distant shores of grief
It's over now!

Something I'm close to,
something left to do
Draw near and prove yourself for brightening
Prepare yourself, don't wait for me,
Expect the day when I come

You have reached out for a while,
You may feel (down),
There's a wreck there, don't turn your eyes

Don't visions bleak,
And its colour's black,
Oh far beyond there is a star in dying sun

I have told
That this will never end (this will never end)
Things go on
But nothing will last,
Only the fool in me believes
There is sense in it.
In distant shores of grief
It's over now!

2. Otherland
They rule the land
They're in command
They hold all the strings in hand
They are invisible
Out of sight
They've designed
A secret place
To play their games
A world, they're in control
Divine law
Divine law
Be aware
Now
Mind your steps
We are uninvited guests,
They may find and catch us
Don't forget
Do what I say
Now connect
Don't even ask
Until we're out of it
Everything's at highest stake
Come take a look
We are in
Take a breath
But don't forget
It isn't real
It isn't true
An illusion
Nothing more

You're a part of the game
You're a slave to the grind
Oblivion
Is your key to the Otherland
You're a part of the game
You're cursed
You're damned
By now you understand

You're a part of the game
You're a slave to the grind
Oblivion
You're welcome to the Otherland
You're a part of the game
You're cursed
You're damned
By now you understand

We get closer
There's no better way
Lullaby Lane
Fade is on its way

The inner district
Is the place you need to know
It's overwhelming
So let's rest here for a while

Someone else appears
Silently
Watch me when I fall down
Everything seems real
Suddenly
Perfect simulation

Come take a look
Breathe it in
Artificial wonderlands
We are wandering around
Things shall vanish
They won't last
Now I know
You understand
This world is not true
Nothing is real
Nothing at all
It's bits and pieces
We walk through

You're a part of the game...

You're a part of the game
You're a slave to the grind
Oblivion
You've reached the promised land
You're a part of the game
You're cursed
You're damned
Welcome to the Otherland

Wait
I can feel things are not right
Do not breathe
Don't look behind,
There's someone else
The observer

A trick of light
A fading line
The entrance is gone
We can't get out of it
We are slightly losing ground

Quick
It is time
We shall go
We better leave
And don't come back,
No way to run
Nowhere to hide
I fear
We're walking aimlessly

You're a part of the game...

You're a part of the game
You're a slave to the grind
Oblivion
Welcome to the Otherland
You're a part of the game
You're cursed
You're damned
You've reached
The promised land

You've crossed the line
You've reached the end

3. Turn The Page
Hunter
We're here to praise your name,
Blazing sun
And a bitter death
You're a guardian
Cross the gate

Wake up it is a new dawning
Wake up the witches wait
For you
Remember the mirror
When she looked in
You were born in the void
In the middle of none
There was nobody else
There was nothing at all
Well sons and daughters
Joy's in the air
The horned one dies
Renewal
Everywhere

Turn the wheel again
A new beginning
Another end
Dried out the land needs blood
Inside the ring we're waiting
Give up yourself
Enter life

It's set out for you
Come turn the wheel
There is nothing to fear
Come turn the wheel
Come turn the page
Come turn the page

We do not believe in lies
Do not believe in lies
There is someone coming
There is someone coming
We hear a voice
From underworld
Now everything should move
When a new day begins

God of wind and god of rain
Turn the wheel
Oh you would better be aware
The mermaids
They will sing for you
The nymphs will bless the child

Reunite them
Sacrifice him

We will be with you until the end
Come move our hearts
We know
There is light beyond the dark

Dried out we cry for blood
Conquer your fear and join us
Come join us now
Time is right

It's set out for you...

A new beginning
Another end
The myth of life
You hold in your hand
We cry out
The land needs blood
The change of season
Praise to the newborn king

It's set out for you...

4. Fly
Stop be quite now
Out with the light and
Then up and down it goes

Fly
Out with the light
There at the door
The inspiration I've looked for
The spirit of the youth appears

No one ever dares to speak
It's nothing else but fantasy
It's make believe
Make believe

No one ever dares to speak
It's nothing else but fantasy
But one day
It all will come to life

Step out of line
And I'll teach you how to fly
Then away we'll go
Leave your mark land of mine
Leave your mark
In the land of mine

The second one to right
And then straight on
Until morning light

Stop be quite now
No irritation
No, not the slightest doubt

We got once
Quick - we better hurry
There from the road I sense
The end of fun gets near
Wonderful thoughts
And imaginations
These things will lift you up

What is it like?
You ask me, my dear
Will there be fairies
Or things to fear?
For fairies sake I'd say
You better come with me
So soon you'll see
Now up and down it goes
And round
Round and round and round

Praise
To my cleverness
They all follow me
All praise to innocence
That's everything it needs
Fly in
Fly out
They'll leave it all behind

No one ever dares to speak...

Life is a map
And it is quite confusing
The lights are up
Now let the play begin
She flies, she flies
Into the light she flies
No words like "Just" in mind
She's finding Neverland
There on the day she dies
Don't stop it now
She still enjoys the scene
Don't stop it now
Don't stop it now
Don't stop it now
Don't stop it now, now, now

No one ever dares to speak...

5. Carry The Blessed Home
Pale faced, the innocent
Will drown in blood
Hurt and withdrawn.
Don't dare to steal my grief
In this haze of green and gold
He's gone.

Blind my eyes
And I still
Can see through the mist
To the very end
There I'll face
What I fear the most.
Blind my eyes
But it all doesn't matter
Right now.

I would bury my dead
And keep on
'Til the end
I won't give up
I won't give up
I'll turn
To the "red fields of none"
There's a grave
There's a rose.

Drift away
I can hear me say
Soon you all shall be free.
Carry the blessed home
No one's left here but me
And I'll sing out your name.

You call me insane, I know.
I've open my heart
And my soul to you son
So pale turns the innocence
And all I feel is pain.
Suddenly I understand
He's gone.

Blind my eyes and I still can see through the mist...

But it all doesn't matter
Right now

Carry the blessed home
No one's left here but me
And I'll sing out your name.
Driven insane?
No
What I feared the most
I have faced, and that's truth.
The grey faced is not innocent
Though I cry in dismay
I will follow decay
I'll move on
Is there anyone here
Who knows
How it feels to be wrong?

Blind my eyes and I still can see through the mist...

But it all doesn't matter
Right now

Matter right now
Matter right now

6. Another Stranger Me
A seed of doubt
It exists
And it grows
A glimpse of life
From somewhere deep within
Awake and understand

Is there anyone else here?
Somebody screaming
Please help me
Let's find out now
That I am not dreaming
Welcome to my damnation
Here it comes the real me

I didn't know
I couldn't hear the answer
My mind was blank
I should have known
I hold it back but somehow
There is someone else
Another stranger me

Another stranger me

That's
When the ice
Will break away

I can't get out here
Anymore
Cause none of my keys
Fit the door
There's fear and anger
Hate and love
I must confess
It's out of hand

It's cynic
It's cynic
Still cynic
All my laughter

It's cynic
Just manic
It's cynic
All her laughter

If there's anyone in
It soon will be over
We'll burn out
Our soul's aflamed
And we're on our own now
Give up you cruel invasion
You're insane I'll show you

I didn't know...

Out and gone
Can't resist
Cold and sore
The bolt of pain
Keeps ripping through my head
I can take no more

Don't tell anyone else but I
Do not believe her
See hates me
Cloud my mind
She's a deceiver
I can feel cruel vibrations
Would you like to meet me?

I didn't know...

Another stranger me

7. Straight Through The Mirror
Can you tell me
Is there any other way?
I cannot hide it
I have doubts
I'm not afraid to stay
I'm here
When the curtain falls.

Once I've touched the rainbow,
The man on the moon will appear.
I won't show fear

I turn to you, father death
I'm begging you
Please
Consider
You may have been wrong

Just close your eyes now
Just close your eyes now

The end's a miracle
Dream on if you dare
Straight through the mirror
We'll sail on through the air
There's magic everywhere
Just be aware
Wake up when the crow will call

There is no truth
There are no rules,
There's no plot here
It's twisted
We're still on course
My friend
Down to the abyss - Orcus lane
Shelter of your memories
Shelter of your pain

The mirror shows truth
Reveals what you are
A phoenix in flames
Arise from the ashes again
We're on our way now
We're on our way now

The end's a miracle
Dream on if you dare
Straight through the mirror
We'll sail on through the air

I feel
There is something wrong.
It's twisting and turning
When everything's burning
Awake
It's not safe

And I'm coming down to you again
We'll sail our miracles and then
If you don't mind
I'll sing a song
A song of lullaby this time

When you're asleep
I'm back again
The world of miracles in hand
If you don't mind
I'll sing a song
A sort of lullaby this time
We're on our way now
We're on our way now

The end's a miracle...

Wake up when the crow will call

8. Lionheart
Just let me out of here
Speak to me
It all would be easier
I want to talk to you.
Who is that?
Do I hear a whisper?
Or do I hear a cry?
Across the brown land
The stumps of time
Oh turn the wheel and heal me
Since moonlight fade
I'm empty - heal me

I'm in search of the Lionheart
I am ashamed
I myself can't make it
Drown Ulysses
Drown here in the silence
Cause down to Hades I've gone
But I cannot get out

Down below
I can't free my mind
Soon I will fade away
Down below
I can't free my mind
Soon I will fade away

"Tic Tac" is the message.
And the lunatic fears
He is no more

Speak to me
It all would be easier
While I'm passing by
Who's that?
Do I hear a whisper?
Or do I hear a cry?
Across the brown land
The ghosts arrive.

Pick up my bones and
Tell me
Is this the "Lake of Fire"?
Hell?
Please

I'm in search of the Lionheart
Nobody else
But the pure can save me.
Drown Ulysses
Drown here in the silence
Cause down to Hades I've gone
But I cannot get out.

Ruins rule my memories
I can't recall the signs
Invite the dead
Then silence struck my mind

Silence is madness
"Tic Tac Tic Tactic"
Says the clock

Just let me out of here
Speak to me
It all would be easier
I want to talk to you
Hear me

Welcome to the sad place
And hand me what is mine
I'm the Theban prophet
The dead and blind

And from sea you'll feel me
Then you'll breath out gently
Leave me

I'm in search of the Lionheart...

9. Skalds And Shadows
Would you believe
In a night like this?
A night like this
When visions come true
Would you believe
In a tale like this?
A lay of bliss
We're praising the old lore
Come to the blazing fire and
See me in the Shadows
See me in the Shadows
Songs I will sing
Of runes and rings
Just hand me my harp
And this night
Turns into myth
Nothing seems real
You soon will feel
The World we live in
Is another skald's
Dream in the shadows
Dream in the shadows
Do you believe
There is sense in it
Is it truth or myth?
They're one in my rhymes
Nobody knows
The meaning behind
The weaver's line
Well nobody else
But the Norns can
See through
The blazing fires of time and
All things will proceed as the
Child of the hallowed
Will speak to you now
See me in the Shadows
See me in the Shadows
Songs I will sing
Of tribes and kings
The carrion bird
And the hall of the slain
Nothing seems real
You soon will feel
The World we live in
Is another skald's
Dream in the shadows
Dream in the shadows

Do not fear for my reason
There's nothing to hide
How bitter your treason
How bitter the lie
Remember the runes
And remember the light
All I ever want
Is to be at you side
We gladden the raven
Now I will
Run through the blazing fires
That's my choice
Cause things
Shall proceed as foreseen

10. The Edge
The world turned innocence
Can you hear me?
I confess I'm no redeemer
Can you hear me?
What shall I do?

I witnessed everything
Faith won't leave me
Mind my tongue
Faith don't leave me
Glow into words

This is the edge now
It's all we're living for
Rain on me
Love you will rain on me
And at the end I,
Boast in he cross
And now
Love reigns -
The god incarnation
I've shaped

Out there is a world on fire

Accursed the hanged one
Divine love for free
What a fateful night
And a grateful life
The choir echoes
"Every man his price"
Price
Light my agony
And crucify me
Void the law
At the ninth hour
Void the law
At the ninth hour

This is the edge now...

The world turns flesh again
Mystified are the final hours
No more fear in
No more fear in

Passover
The brook
Time it is at hand
Obscure the facts
A passion play

This is the edge now...

Hallowed be thy name
Hallowed be thy name
No more fear in

Come take a look
The old symbols they move
Wounds still bleed
That's creed
No more fear in
Can you see me?
Come take a look
At the depth of my soul

11. The New Order
Would you open the door
Son I know the way
Soon a flickering light
Will grow
Leave it to me now.
Unchained
Unchained
Would you open the door
Enter the here and now
A new horizon
You'll rise you'll fall
And learn to live
Keep the faith - keep the pace

Your soul's like water but
Your fate is like the wind

Here is the new order
Hope shall be your guide
Praise the new order
Now let my spirit go

Do you remember
When we were moon knights?
We've slain the dragon
In the room
Now you see the future
Your quest the truth
How will it end up
I really do not know

This is no wonderland
Just keep in mind
Like a spell in certain books
Time will change it all

Away - oh please embrace me
Away - I will be gone

I'll take a look to see
What lies beyond
The break of dawn
Would you open the door
There is so much more to say

Keep the faith
Keep the pace.
Your soul's like water, but
Your fate is like the wind.

Here is the new order...

Will you remember the old rule?
Will you fulfill this sacrifice?
Done for the future
Space for the new
How will it end up?
That's up to you

You're on the bridge -
On the borderline
No matter how
You'll never ever leave it

Here is the new order...

Times will change

The soul's like water and
Like rain it will return

Live on in healing rain

The past shall find release

12. All The King's Horses
[Japanese Bonus Track]

I can feel I'm one
With the tortured land
With its solitude and decay
There's no one left
All the other men
Pass on through the night

All dead and gone
Still I don't dare to move
The imprisoned soul
Cannot find back home

Snow falls down
It covers field and blood
Snow falls down
And clears the view

It is cold

And once again
The battle's fought
Out on the plains
So rhymes spread out its glory
But
No rhyme defines its pain

I can't recall all their names
Connection broke loose
They've crossed the lake
Reach the other side
And leave me alone
With the truth

All the king's horses
And all the king's men
They've failed to damn the flood
They've failed to find the grail
Talisien, old friend of mine
Sing my song

Then once again
The battle's lost
I am to blame
Snow falls down
All dead and gone
They all are dead and gone
They've turned to dust
They've sealed the past
A long long time ago

I can't recall all their names
Connection broke loose
They've crossed the lake
Reach the other side
And leave me alone
With the truth

I can't recall all their names
Connection broke loose
They've crossed the lake
Reach the other side
And leave me alone
With the truth

13. Dead Sound Of Misery
[Digipak Bonus Track]

It's dark
Let's do it now
Bring in the sirens
Cut of their tongues
Do it now
Ignore their cries
Ignore their cries
Now close the door
And leave it
Nothing went wrong
The Archangel is falling
Mourners split
Take heart of grace
A ghostly candle light
Lit my room at night
Son of man
We're breeding wastelands
Wastelands

The blood of Sirens
On my hands
I can't wash away
Still it pours
And stains our land
In bitterness
So cruel
Will ages go by
Dead sound of misery
Come share our sorrows
Be one with the Hydra

It's drown or burn
I'm exploring bedlam
The time is right to move
Furthermore
Bring out the dead
Turn your back
On the ones you have loved
Enjoy the heat of your whore
Babylon
Hear what the spirits says
There is no sense at all
Now come with me
Unfold the seals
No sense at all
No sense at all
There is no sense at all
So many times I have failed
Pure desperation
Still hear the cries
Of voices
Long gone by
They've gone abroad
And left this world behind
Leave me behind
Behind the walls I'm crying

The blood of Sirens...

So many times I have failed
Pure desperation
Still hear the cries
Of voices
Long gone by
They've gone abroad
And left this world behind
Leave me behind
Behind the walls I'm crying

The blood of Sirens...

1. The Ninth Wave
As dark night embraces

We are the nation
I will cleanse all your thoughts
We will cleanse them all
Now, my children
For the sake of our nation
Let us carry on
In glory
When dark night embraces

We are the nation
Be my fellowmen
We will wipe them out
Let there be light
For the sake of our nation
Precious and bright
When dark night embraces my mind

A twisted plan 
After all
Despite all burden
Life has grown
And though the curse is still alive

File 664
The golden age's vanished and more
The ingenious knight knows it's over
He no longer denies there's a real me
He'll be disgraced

Burnt and sealed
They may end
As we will rule the world
Defeat the dying old Crow
Let this fire burn

Sail on till you reach the promised land
We all drown in the fifth dimension
The ninth wave
I can feel it's coming
The ninth wave

Sail on till you reach the promised land
We all wait for a new tomorrow
We'll bring a new age
Along with the final wave
The final wave
We will rise

Burn them all, bring the damned
There's a price to pay
Burn them all, bring the damned
Do as I command
Our praise and triumph will grow
We'll defy the Nine
Delete the dying old Crow

To Muriel's fire, walk with me

Down to the Abaddon
Will you walk with me to the Sheol?
Good or bad we all meet the Abaddon
Take a look and you see it's all the same

Imaginations
Exterminate them
Imaginations
Exterminate them

An evil revelation
A wicked thought
Denied by their savior
They all prayed for
Salvation
There are no gods
So no one can save them
Until
They will redeem Belial
They will unite them all
Then many men will fall
When they will heed the call
So they'll be free
Before the final curtain falls
Belial
Bring the cursed
Bring the damned
As we will rule the world
They'll seek the dying old Crow
Let this fire burn

Sail on till you reach the promised land
We all drown in the fifth dimension
The ninth wave
I can feel it's coming
The ninth wave

Sail on till you reach the promised land
We all wait for a new tomorrow
We'll bring a new age
Reborn as aeon gods
As aeon gods
We'll break through

Further down you'll walk with me

Down to seal Avalon
Will you walk with me to the fire?
Further down we come to seal Avalon
Take a look and you see it's all the same

Imaginations
Determination
Imaginations
Determination

There is no real salvation
We will wipe them out
And nothing remains here
As we don't need salvation
We will not fade
Forever we'll stay here

Screams come from the inside
The king is gone, but
This war is not over

Cries come from the outside
Yes, void will find thee
This war is not over

Burnt and sealed they may end
As we will rule the world
Delete the dying old Crow
Let this fire burn

Sail on till you reach the promised land
We all drown in the fifth dimension
The ninth wave
I can feel it's coming
The ninth wave

Sail on till you reach the promised land
We all wait for a new tomorrow
We'll bring a new age
Reborn as aeon gods
As aeon gods
We'll break through

2. Twilight Of The Gods
How've they dared to be
Such misguided creatures
How've they dared to be
Of such evil nature
Spiral up to doors all sealed
No turning back
Red door to Discordia

Steal the stars
Deceive the day
A sign of evil
They're gone with a final warning

Witness the twilight of the gods
Will they ever return
A storm will take us
And then wipe us out
There's no retreat

We're trapped in twilight
While the gods will drowse
Gods will drowse
They'll wait and sleep
Until a new dawn'll save us from the dark

The damage's done
The king is gone

There is war
Wherever I'll roam
Gods will come and
Gods will go
The spinning wheel keeps turning

Now get up
Lay down your ancient faith
We're the chosen ones
Come feel the change

A way
Let me show a new way
When you dare to walk with me
Bow down
And surrender
The old gods

Black or white
To me it's grey
A sign of evil
I hail all these non-believers

Witness the twilight of the gods
Will they ever return
A storm will take us
And then wipe us out
There's no retreat

We're trapped in twilight
While the gods will drowse
Gods will drowse
They'll wait and sleep
Until a new dawn'll save us from the dark

Deliver your gods
They shall be slain
I'm their fallen son
Don't be afraid

A way
Let me show a new way
When you're going to walk with me
As one
We're infernal

What's going up
It will come down
We're here to change
There's war in Discordia

Sure as death
We all must fade
A sign of evil
Now reach for a new horizon

Witness the twilight of the gods
Will they ever return
A storm will take us
And then wipe us out
There's no retreat

We're trapped in twilight
While the gods will drowse
Gods will drowse
They'll wait and sleep
Until a new dawn'll save us from the dark

3. Prophecies
I can see a crow
On your judgement day
Seems like a sermon
Please come over
Don't come over
Please come over
Here
Welcome the last day of our lives

I will break the circle
Walls, I'll tear them down
And guilt will break the silence
But there is no return
No return
We shall overcome

We will bring you back
To a moment in time
We will reveal and detect
What you are
Precious truth in a cage
It has been captured but safe
And there we'll bind it and
Blind it with lies

The king will come
World will come undone

He is the center of creation
The prophecy
It's a promise to us all

A crow, a storm
Shadows will be rising soon
A crow, a storm
The Nine sing
Once upon a dream ago
We're the ones you've left alone

Now, as we speak
There's a way
There's a door
Come find us
And join us
Come see it and feel it

Doors in and out
You shall be falling
Your mind's still trapped in twilight
Now, catch a glimpse
Shall I get through
They've walked on
To the other side
But how could I know?
I'm drowning
Drowning
Where do I belong?
Drown in shadows
I am the center of creation
They prophecy
It's a promise to us all

A crow, a storm
Shadows will be rising soon
A crow, a storm
The Nine sing
Once upon a dream ago
We're the ones you've left alone

Don't blame me
Don't blame me
It's my lying toad
The Crow and the Hare
They've moved
Further into the unknown

Mark my words
They will be gone
You'll see them playing games, my dear
They've moved along
Cause one day in the afterlife
We'll meet again
They've frowning
Frowning
On your judgement day
They are shadows
They're in the center of creation
They prophecy
It's a promise to us all

A crow, a storm
Shadows will be rising soon
A crow, a storm
The Nine sing
Once upon a dream ago
We're the ones you've left alone

But don't be afraid
There's war beyond the red door
And please ignore their pleas
Just break the seal
Break the seal, find the red door
There's a red
There's a red
There's a fed door
Break the seal, find the red door

The eternal
The infernal
The eternal
We shall better get him back
The eternal
The infernal
The eternal
Will we ever see the light again

4. At The Edge Of Time
I step from door to door
My mind's misguided
Keep moving on and on
Forevermore

Was it real what I saw in the mirror?
Was it fear when the end got clearer?

Now as my time's passing by
What am I waiting for?

Who'll grant me wings to fly?
And will I have another try?

'Cause I would not miss my moment again
Yes, I would not miss my moment my friend

No one knows the answer
What could have been
The edge I still fear
The roads they're leading nowhere
There is no end, no end
Oh gods be with me
Carry me along 
I blindness I tried to march on 
Mystified me
Yes, it fooled me

No surrender 
Don't surrender
I hear them calling
I hear them calling
Can hear them scream
Don't be late when aeons pass
Your memories will fade
Even the purest one might fail
Here and deceive
The righteous soul
And then their world will come undone

They burn, they bleed
Till the savior will break through
In between the realms they're gathered
And from the edge of time
Once they return
They will save us all
Now break through

Recall the eclipse
There is none who survive
Defeat, defeat, defeat
There's no more
You've searched for the answer
The answer is creed
They're real no more
You cannot get over, no more

My light shall shine forever
The Nine beyond the wall
They're turning
They're burning
They now understand
I soon will seal all doors
Their stars won't shine here anymore
Their savior won't even try
He can't remember the truth
My words become real
And there's nothing they can do

They may follow a plan the one had
Deeply sad
They have chosen the wrong side
And tried to resist
All their visions and music
No longer exist
When the morrow will come
It shall all be
In between
In between the realms
In between the realms
They might move on

That's when all pureness dies in vain
There's no release
The infernal lord has won
And forevermore
Yes, forevermore

They burn, they bleed
Till the savior will break through
In between the realms they're gathered
And from the edge of time
Once they return
They will save us all
Now break through

Will I 
Yes, will I fail to believe, my friend?
What if it's all done in vain?

Don't afraid
Will it be me they blame?
See, it's a whole world
That I've once condemned
And I shattered it all
With a thought as it seems
But it all has been me
As the mirror has revealed
Now reveal
Now redeem
I will carry the storm
The savior's coming home

Yes, I'll carry the grail
And I'll wash away the pain

There's no release
The infernal lord has won
And forevermore
Yes, forevermore

They burn, they bleed
Till the savior will break through
In between the realms they're gathered
And from the edge of time
Once they return
They will save us all
Now break through

Where do you go?
Where do you go from here?

I don't look back
There's more in me
My hour shall come
The old gods are calling
Then straight ahead
A door appears
The tyrant must go down
That's when the ancient gods return
They will return

5. Ashes Of Eternity
The Hare once betrayed me
And so did the Fox and the Crow
Just once defied me
There's me and there's Space
Where are they?
Maybe dead
No one knows
You can't defy me

Ride all along
With me
There's no tomorrow
Now let me through
And wait for my command

Don't try to be cruel
Oh, my beautiful child
But how can you try to redeem the past?
It's not real as it seems
Now ride on your wave
And get back to that place
Scratch deeper and deeper
And soon I will be on my own

The gods will ignore your end
They'll defend the elder
The lords won't salute you
The saints they won't save you 
They'll defend their guardian
The savior won't heal your soul

Caesar

No man's world
It's the Ides of March
Then from the ashes of eternity
A new spirit will rise
A new order shall take over

Now
Raise the flag
The war seems over
And bow your head
At dawn they shall be murdered

Woes, I will not complain
The further you get
The closer's the end, dear

But now
I will try
Come and see
That things are not what they may seem

It's all written down
The savior lies bleeding
But he won't surrender
The scriptures don't lie
He'll e turned around
No one to blame

It all goes down

The gods will ignore your end
They'll defend the elder
The lords won't salute you
The saints they won't save you 
They'll defend their guardian
The savior won't heal your soul

Now go and get
Your holy grail
And don't forget
Just once you'll cross the border

Now let the saints
The saints come marching in
Whatever you'll do
Do it fast
My sweet son of decay
Now let the saints
The saints come marching in
Transform
You may pass
Rearrange it
Now change to betray

I won't lie
While bright eyes are turning pale
Your sands run low

Your light shines
My last try
It'll soon be over

No sign shall be given for ages and more
You may enter first
But from now you will be on your own

The gods will ignore your end
They'll defend the elder
The lords won't salute you
The saints they won't save you 
They'll defend their guardian
The savior won't heal your soul

You're getting your grail
But there's no place to go
Longing for a new shore
Eastern winds they blow cold
The saints you will bring them down
The savior won't take the crown
Let my spirit fly
Let it fly

6. Distant Memories
[Limited Edition/Vinyl Track]Now Storm come closer
Can feel you're getting near
Just stay invisible till it’s over

But still they don’t know
They're just caught in distant memories
Then these fools will fade away
They may not fear the fall

They won't be anymore
I hear their silent singing

We don't fear anymore
We don't fear him

Now don't come closer
Stand still
Don't interfere
Don’t move or things go wrong

We're trapped in twilight
Trapped in the mind of a sacrificial king
And the sun won't shine here anymore
I curse the Crow
Dear old friend

And when the time is right for changes
We will salute you
And a new age may begin

But still they don't know
They're just caught in distant memories
Then these fools will fade away
They may not fear the fall

When all the magic is gone
No need to carry it along

Whatever the cost
It will not be redeemed
And whatever may come
It will not bring relief

In the mirror
They may fail to see
What is real behind
There it ends
And there is no return
They will go down
They all will have to drown

Out of the dark
Into the grey
These fools will fade away
No matter what
I've come to say
These fools will fade away

A storm comes closer
Can feel you're getting near?
Just stay invisible, you're no savior

But still they don’t know
They're just caught in distant memories
Then these fools will fade away
They may not fear the fall

I know they reach out for someone
Reach out for the great unknown

But still they don't know
They're just caught in distant memories
Then these fools will fade away
They may not fear the fall

They've thought
It is time for changes
We will salute you
Moved on to the promised land
We will salute you
Now let it begin
They've found a new god

7. The Holy Grail
We, together
Change the world forever
What a cheerful sound
Synchronize me
Supervise me, mother
No more fooling around

Whatever may come
It shall be from the ashes
He shall rise, I know

And though it hurts me
Don't be surprised, dear mother
Longing to see his end

Don't call it
Hopelessly insane
I go and grasp the grail
But in a graceful way
Illegally, my aim
The grail will cross the border now

Don't tell me that you're innocent
Don't tell me it's divinely ordained by the saints
My demons, my saviors
I weep for all of them
Suffered in vain

My wayward son, you might disturb me
Carry the flame
Till dying embers will stop gleaming

There on the battlefield she sings
Praise, hallelujah
The Holy Grail's on its way now
Magna eterna
Magna eterna sings
Your journey's over
The Holy Grail's on its way now

Do as it's foreseen
Come and meet the king
There's no choice
For the word it must be
Real, my righteous brother
Fear you soon will know

So, on the fourteenth day passover
He took the firstborn sons
Execute him and now act as
Judas, the chosen one

So after all, in vain
I've met him and found the grail
Cause in a skillful way
I'll change to keep alive 
Eternal lie, I'll be the one

Key to life, be the eclipse
Voices from the river Styx
Come to be the Nemesis
Kiss of death
Crucifix and the grail

I've traveled far on hidden pathways
The Holy Grail
Who would have thought that I will hold it
The Holy Grail

There on the battlefield she sings
Praise, hallelujah
The Holy Grail's on its way now
Magna eterna
Magna eterna sings
Your journey's over
The Holy Grail's on its way now

Don't tell me that you're innocent
Don't tell me that there is a chance to be free
The grail's sent, my way ends
I creep along with the shadows
And resurrected
He comes marching in
There he is
Good lord forgive my sins

Once I've crossed the river Styx
At Sheol's gate, I know
Key to the apocalypse
I have sealed it with a kiss
Nothing that I want to do
Hades is calling
Wake the witch, who'll be the brave one?
Don't say what he's like
Full of voices comes the ninth wave
Don't say what it's like
Beyond the door

There on the battlefield she sings
Praise, hallelujah
The Holy Grail's on its way now
Magna eterna
Magna eterna sings
Your journey's over
The Holy Grail's on its way now

Norns are howling
Norns are prowling

8. The Throne
Get him off the throne
Moreover he's not in control no longer
The King will come, it's over
The game goes on

Someone's waiting on the other side
Trying to get over

Got to be in this hour

There on the other side
We know that someone keeps waiting

Don't you know your enemy?
Don't you know you're damned?

Release the beast
Set it free
I've come to tell you once more
Don't let him break this seal
But let me tell you once more
Peace shall come

We must serve the fire
We must confess we are liars
There must be something in the end

We're the curse
Got to feed it
We must serve the fire
Determination
Blame the light

For all must burn down in the end

We must serve the fire
We must serve the fire

Give us shelter from the storm
Give us hope
Give us shelter from the storm
Give us hope

Curse the wind
A storm from the north
Comes to divide us
Will deny us
To break your king

These were dark lands
In a dead world
Rearranged
We brought it into light
A union of the land and king

It's a new world
It is new land
But it ends here
In the here and now
Another failure once again

We will not believe in any word you may say
We will not believe in any word you may say

Now we can see the enemy
I've come to tell you once more
It's me, I hold the key
But let me tell you once more
Peace shall come

We must serve the fire
We must confess we are liars
There must be something in the end

We're the curse
Got to feed it
We must serve the fire
Determination
Blame the light

For all must burn down in the end

We must serve the fire
It's a curse we are all bound
We must serve the fire

Curse them all
They'll tear down the wall
Come to divide us
They'll defy us
Take my throne

All I am is nothing else
What you have made me
Nothing more I am
Your vision of another god
All I know is they won't give
But they will take
Your sacred light away
And still they come to praise the damned

Can't you see?
It's your innocence they'll steal away
Yes, they're coming for you
They've come to deceive
You are betrayed
You admire these liars
They'll never fool me

We will not surrender
We won't take it no more
We will not surrender
We won't take it anymore

We'll break the seal and set 'em free
I've come to tell you once more
As I will now reveal
But let me tell you once more
Peace is gone

We must serve the fire
We must confess we are liars
There must be something in the end

We're the curse
Got to feed it
We must serve the fire
Determination
Blame the light

For all must burn down in the end

We must serve the fire
It's a curse we are all bound
We must serve the fire

We're the curse
Got to feed it
We must serve the fire
Determination
Blame the light

We must serve the fire
It's a curse we are all bound
We must serve the fire

Determination
Blame the light
Blame the night
Day and night
Black and white

Take a look at yourself
There is nothing to fear no more
There is nothing to fear no more

9. Sacred Mind
Could not break the silence
Could not move in here
How can they stay so silent?
All the grief and violence
For all they went through
For all it breaks loose

It's bursting out 
Fire, walk with me
Fire, walk with me

The will is strong
Can I show you Fear?

Don't move
Don't turn
Don't come too close as I 
Burn down this place
My spirit will set it all on fire

Would you like to meet the tyrant in the twilight zone?

Get in, don't be late
And breathe in my reality
But first break the silence

There is more
Beyond the dawn he's rising
Where darkness grows
He traveling in disguise
Now don't look back
Now you know why
We set sail to new shores
We will meet him

Sacred mind
We build a new pleasure-dome here
Xanadu
My Xanadu
My Xanadu

Don't look back, just enter
What I call my soul asylum
Where they are playing tricks
Everybody
If you like to see
Whatever lies beyond that golden door
It seems
My frequency's turned weak
Try to remember me
Try to remember me

Then for a while
We've heard the sounds of sirens
You turn to stone
Medusa's in your sight
I tell you why
Rearranged by the ages gone by
You can change it

Sacred mind
We build a new pleasure-dome here
Xanadu
My Xanadu
My Xanadu

Sacred mind
We build a new pleasure-dome here
Xanadu
My Xanadu
My Xanadu

Chance or predestined end
Praise, hallelujah

Never mind the end
Fool the mall
Fear the demon in disguise
Keep your secret inside

Let's move on, it's time
A thousand years gone by
The pleasure-dome
What will we hear
And what will we see

All a lie
There's no boat
There's no river 
No shore
Journey's over

Sacred mind
We build a new pleasure-dome here
Xanadu
My Xanadu
My Xanadu

10. Miracle Machine
When they are coming
Give us guidance
For they are calling
To erase the damned
Yet, after all they praise the coming
To erase the damned
They will return
Now let me take you to the other side
Turn off the light and let it grow

They will set it on fire
They come to fool us all

They are slaves to the Fire, you know

Their fire must grow
They have to feed it

We must believe in something
That I would call a miracle
The grail will break the final seal
We must believe in something
A miracle, a miracle machine
We just hide it secretly

No belief, no belief, no belief
Give us what we need

Betrayed by the Nine
I've learned to love the shadows
And now they're coming home
That's why I need you on the other side

And then we, we may carry another light
I summon from the inside, deeper insight

They don't belong here
Though they claim they're right
Let it grow

Turn off the light
Let reason grow

They will set it on fire
They come to fool us all

They are slaves to the Fire, you know

Their fire must grow
They have to feed it

We must believe in something
That I would call a miracle
The grail will break the final seal
We must believe in something
A miracle, a miracle machine
We just hide it secretly

For they are coming
Give us guidance

11. Grand Parade
Let this game begin
Watch, my children
Watch me
You've all come to die
For this battle is lost
Lost
Losing their minds
Losing their souls
Hush, now hush
We don't talk
We don't care anymore
I will seal every door
We don't care anymore
I summon the Nine now
Confirm the alignment
Can I get through?
Carry on, you fools
Try to break free
When we fail
It's lost forever
When we fail
It's lost forever

It's not real, no reason to be here
No more fear and no more regrets
Don't look back and free your mind
Stay where you are till the sealing is over

Say goodbye, my friend
Here's your promised end
Be a part of the grand parade
Along we're driven
On and on, it's a grand parade
We're one, we're so sorry to say
It's all the same, you will see
On this grand parade
Damnation
Now join the grand parade

Don't be upset
I will seal every door
Every now and then
Seal every door
They'll try to awake the misguided
I will seal every door
The voices you'll hear
They will claim to be real
It's not true

Now look around
We will bring them down
The more I'll show
The less you will know
The Nine will frown
Now see how it grows
Secretly my vision comes true

It's not real
You'll hear it, you'll see it
The otherworld
The otherworld
The otherworld appears

Now round and round
We all shall lose ground
Now praise, I'm the one

We will never fear
We will never fear
We will never fear them again

Oh and here comes the son, the son
He's gone with the shadows
Along with the stars

No more gods, no more lies

No more gods, no war
We'll be free here, we are one
Our will is strong

No more lies and no more tyrants
It all becomes real when the sealing is over

Say goodbye, my friend
Here's your promised end
Be a part of the grand parade
Along we're driven
On and on, it's a grand parade
We're one, we're so sorry to say
It's all the same, you will see
On this grand parade
Damnation
Now join the grand parade

There is no return
It would be the end

We shall sing, we shall sing
Praise the day

Void
We don't fear you no more
Mother void
You can't enter no more

We don't need any hallows
We don't fear any shadows
Shadows on the wall
They're not real
Now, walk in, everyone

Here comes the sun

We will never fall
We will never fall
We will never see him again

Many
We're one
We're humanized
The time has come

This flesh is truth
This blood is real
The highest cause
It's all that we are longing for

There on the river Styx
You'll see, my friend
There on the river Styx
You'll see
They've fooled you to take it away

So no more myths
No more bliss
We are holding it in our hand
And there is nothing they can do

And so this battle ends forevermore
We don't fear anything
Nor any other race
We take control
No longer we act like fools
We're in control

Say goodbye, my friend
Here's your promised end
Be a part of the grand parade
Along we're driven
On and on, it's a grand parade
We're one, we're so sorry to say
It's all the same, you will see
On this grand parade
Damnation
Now join the grand parade

Drown one more time
While we all will say goodbye
Bright, it shines bright
Let us carry one the lie
No more lies, all a lie
One more lie

12. Doom
[Bonus Track]How did I get here?
What will I find here?
I've come to meet
The evil one

I understand
There is no sense
The curse lives on
My children mourn

Truth is a beast
With a sad face
A demon
The cruelest of all

Forever
Forever

I'm wondering
Who is it for?
There's nothing more

There is no door
No more lies

You won't enter
You will see
They've locked the secret place out

And day won't come again

So there's no relief
When truth shall be revealed
By now you know the answer
So there's no relief
But revenge

Abandoned, forgotten, deceived
Wherever they may roam
So faithful, so loyal
Still no one will come
You're alone

Don't call it destiny

We will remember
Skies may fade
And stars may wane
We won't forget
And your light shines bright
Yes, so much brighter
Shine on
We will remember
Until the skies will fall
We won't forget
We will remember
We all shall follow doom

It's going down
Going down
And there's nothing you can do

Look into my eyes
And see
Your seed
It may grow
This is no vision

It's the curse I set upon your kin
You'll be deceived

Their cries shall come true
It shall be me
You blame
Now watch and see
I'll set doom
Upon you
Your offspring shall bloom
Wherever they may roam
I'll bind them
I'll split them
In solitude
Sorrow shall grow
Unknown

We will remember
Skies may fade
And stars may wane
We won't forget
And your light shines bright
Yes, so much brighter
Shine on
We will remember
Until the skies will fall
We won't forget
We will remember
We all shall follow doom

There is no choice
There's repentance
'Cause nothing will grow here at all
Redeem the oath
And pay the price
If you want

Here on these fields
Where truth shall be revealed
In doom you'll find the answers
Still there's no release
You shall feel

Let's face it
Since everything's shown
You've been through this alone
The deeper the wounds
So much greater the sorrows will grow
There is no sense in it

We will remember
Skies may fade
And stars may wane
We won't forget
And your light shines bright
Yes, so much brighter
Shine on
We will remember
Until the skies will fall
We won't forget
We will remember
We all shall follow doom

1. Fly
Stop, be quiet now
Out with the light and,
Then up and down it goes
Fly out with the light
There at the door,
The Inspiration I´ve looked for,
The Spirit of the youth appears

No one ever dares to speak
It's nothing else but fantasy
It's make believe, make believe

No one ever dares to speak
It's nothing else but fantasy
But One day it all will come to life

Step out of line
And I'll teach you how to fly
The Away we´ll go
Leave your mark, leave your mark in the land of mine

The second one to the right
And then Straight on until morning light

Stop, be quiet now
No irritation
No not the slightest doubt

We go at once
Quick - We better hurry,
There from the road I sense
The end of fun gets near
Wonderful thoughts and imaginations
These dreams will lift you up

What is it like? You ask me, my dear
Will there be fairies, or things to fear
For fairies sake I'd say you better come with me
So soon you´ll see,
Now up and down it goes and round
Round and round and round,

Praise to my cleverness
They all follow me,
All praise to innocence
That's everything it needs,
Fly in,
Fly out,
They leave it all behind

No one ever dares to speak
It's nothing else but fantasy
It's make believe,
Make believe
No one ever dares to speak
It's nothing else but fantasy
But One day it will all come to life

Step out of line
And I'll teach you how to fly
The Away we´ll go
Leave your mark land of mine
Leave your mark in the land of mine

[Solo]

Life is a map and it is quite confusing
The lights are up now let the play begin
She flies, she flies,
Into the light she flies
No words like "ust" in mind
She's finding Neverland
There on the day she dies
Don't stop it now,
She still enjoys the scene
Don't stop it now,
Don't stop it now,
Don't stop it now,
Don't stop it now, now, now

No one ever dares to speak
It's nothing else but fantasy
It's make believe,
Make believe
No one ever dares to speak
It's nothing else but fantasy
But One day it will all come to life

Step out of line
And I'll teach you how to fly
The Away we´ll go
Leave your mark land of mine
Leave your mark in the land of mine

2. Scalds And Shadows
Would you believe in a night like this?
A night like this, when visions come true
Would you believe in a tale like this?
A lay of bliss, we're praising the old lore
Come to the blazing fire and
See me in the shadows
See me in the shadows

Songs I will sing
Of runes and rings
Just hand me my harp
This night turns into myth
Nothing seems real
But you soon will feel
The world we live in is another t´s
Dream in the shadows
Dream in the shadows

Do you believe there is sense in it?
Is it truth or myth?
They´re one in my ryhmes
Nobody knows the meaning behind
The weaver´s line
Well nobody else but the Noms can
See through the blazing fires of time and
All things will proceed as the
Child of the hallowed
Will speak to you now
See me in the shadows
See me in the shadows

Songs I will sing of tribes and kings
The carrion bird and the hall of the slain
Nothing seems real
You soon will feel
The world we live in is another Skald´s
Dream in the shadows
Dream in the shadows

Do not fear for my reason
There's nothing to hide
How bitter your treason
How bitter the lie
Remember the runes and remember the light
All I ever want is to be at your side
We gladden the raven
Now I will run through the blazing fires
That's my choice
'Cause things shall procede as foreseen

3. In A Gadda Da Vida
In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida, honey,
Don't you know that I love you?
In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida, baby,
Don't you know that I'll always be true?

Oh, won't you come with me
And take my hand?

Oh, won't you come with me
And walk this land?

Please take my hand!

1. Sacred Worlds
The realm's bleeding
it suffers -
Old an weak

No further arguing
There is war at hand
The system's failing
Engine's running

Then after all
I sense the end is dawning
These lunatics deny the truth

I know I will not fail
There'll be

War
It's now or never
We shall stand together
One by one
This world is sacred
I'm coming home
War
It's now or never
We shall stand together
One by one
This world is sacred
I'm coming home

Coming home

You chase in twilight
and you know
you will be on your own
on your own

The misery shown
I'll be alone in this hour
I face the unknown
Witness the end

I'm bleeding. I'm fading
Here in my final hour
When long lost memories return
And a voice keeps calling
"All dead and gone
it's out of hand
Life is in motion"
I'm wishing. I'm fading
"Time to wake up
face the truth"

I'm sinking
I'm drowning
There's no doubt and no regret
"Time to reveal now"
This is no illusion
It is real
Carry on the flame
It's not over now
Watch me, I will rise
Time to reveal now

I know I will not fail
Anymore

I'm the one forever
All that really matters
Blessed realm
This world is sacred
I'm coming home
War
It's now or never
We shall stand together
One by one
This world is sacred
I'm coming home

Yesterday's gone
There's no today, no tomorrow
I'm raised from the dead
The ritual failed

There at the gates
I'm left alone in this hour
Driven insane
I am left alone

And now i drown in deepest shadows
While the golden hall is sealed
I'm wishing
I'm fading
And I'm part of the machine
My eyes are the eyes of a dead man
and feel the unholy stream

The source of my power
T-energy
I'm in control

I will live forever
All that really matters
Blessed realm
This world is sacred
I'm coming home
War
It's now or never
We shall stand together
One by one
This world is sacred
I'm coming home

I spread my wings
But keep on falling
I should have known
I can see it coming
The war is over
There's whispering in the wind
Just let me out of here
There is no way
There's no end
While all the suffering goes on
All that I know
Is that I'm not insane
It's not over

2. Tanelorn
I travel a dusty old road
And carry on in ultimate terror
The torture will grow
While infinity's lost
The lunatic fears the unknown

Into the fire
Curse me
Unknown
Into the fire
Everything is gone

Did I miss the point
Or fail to see
That I am lost
Cause I am chosen

Crush another tower
Grind the universe
I'll fear it into pieces
Mourn forevermore
And here I

Cry for Tanelorn
Still I fear their voices
Cry for Tanelorn
No more fear, no voices
Cry for Tanelorn
Into the void this journey ends
Cry for Tanelorn
The dawn comes crashing down
Into the void

My locked up asylum
Don't turn your back
On your prodigal son
When terror is raging
Still my hate will grow

Here on my own
I've built a pyre
Oh, fire
Here on my own
I've wasted life
So weak

A dark sword
A black soul
My soulmate gets near
Deceiver
Deceiver

I'm banned from the island
Refuse my, deny me
I'm pale and I'm weak
Now I don't belong here anymore

Cry for Tanelorn
Still I fear their voices
Cry for Tanelorn
No more fear, no voices
Cry for Tanelorn
Into the void this journey ends
Cry for Tanelorn
The dawn comes crashing down
Into the void

The trouble of many I've seen
It's coming to an end
Here's my last stand
The torture at last
Will be gone with the past
Infinity. Where will I go?

Into the fire
Curse me
In war
Into the fire
Everything is gone

It's your blood I desire
The last soul I require
Right alter all the damage will down

And here I
Cry for Tanelorn
Still I fear their voices
Cry for Tanelorn
No more fear, no voices
"Feeding my void
Feeding my void
Here at the edge. I claim your soul"
Cry for Tanelorn
The dawn comes crashing down
Into the void

Stormbringer
All hail stormbringer

3. Road Of No Release
[Dead girl:]
Please, sister, wake me up
you've traveled far
Release my mind
Sing this song of mine
Save me from drowning
Quick, cast your spell on me
I sense you're finally getting near
Can you hear me crying?
I've got to break the silence

[The lover:]
I know they're out there
Play hide and seek
watching
My love is wasted

[The storyteller:]
My worst dreams
I can't leave them
I'm the black queen
Here in barren lands

[The fox:]
When you walk down
You may not find relief
will you go down there
I wonder
Wonder why

[All:]
Here on this road of no release
Pale reign of misery
That even time cannot erase
On through my sorrows
Life will go on

[Dead girl:]
Words and dreams unite
I hear an ancient voice
It's calling for me
When death and life collide
I hear an ancient song

[The resurrected girl:]
Deep inside
I can't find myself
Can't remember at all
The past and my strange end
come guide me now
Can't remember my fall
There's something
There's someone
It's ain't over now
The void - There's more to it
It's real and still alive

[The necromancer:]
I will find you
Slipping away
I'll bind you
Still I conquer the world
Take him away

[All:]
Here on this road of no release
Pale reign of misery
That even time cannot erase
On through my sorrows
Life will go on

[The fox:]
My last steps
Can't leave her
I, the old fox
Will take revenge

[Old man:]
I cannot heal your fear and doubts
The void, It waits for us
Still, After all the ghosts are howling
You cannot run, you cannot hide
The void, it waits for us
Still after all there is no choice

[All:]
Here on this road of no release
Pale reign of misery
That even time cannot erase
On through my sorrows
Life will go on

[The girl:]
Find me, I'm drowning
Then once again
There's nothing left I fear
There's nothing more to say
And no more games to play
to play

4. Ride Into Obsession
Come, I show you the end
You're dammed
Cause no one can defy me
Just watch these maddened creatures
Like you they all once reached out
A war to win
But I'm gonna burn this vision down

Call me the father of lies
Just watch these saddened creatures
they've torned you into their savior

You hold your ground
Until your last breath
You'll twist then turn
and now you're falling down

The battle rages on
And forever and ever
The wheel will turn

Let ages come and go
The will turn now
The wheel will turn
Another ride into obsession
I am reborn
The wheel will turn now
And I am driven to obsession

All these dying men
try to understand
They all followed the sign

Ir's a cyrcle's end
There no hope
for a while
 From the ashes arise

Can't save her
Enjoy the flames
So precious, so pure

and you try
You're sure to fail
And madness
Is the price you've to pay

Unholy grounds
Witness your last breath
The cyrcle ends
And you're stumbling

The battle will go on
and forever and ever
It's raging on

Let ages come and go
The wheel will turn now
The wheel will turn
Another ride into obsession
I am reborn
The wheel will turn now
And I'm driven to obsession

Through the flames you'll see me
You'll be mine, believe me
This is the moment I long for

Wake up there's a storm to face and
Right now while the land lies bleeding
It's me, I conquer your soul

Still I'll be on my way
Oh light, let me out of here I pray

And over and over and over again
There is no beginning
No end

This war, it still goes on
And forever and ever
I will return

Let ages come and go
The wheel will turn now
The wheel will turn
Another ride into obsession
I am reborn
The wheel will turn now
And I'm driven to obsession

Light - so serene
True source reign over me
There's no end and
There's no beginning
"You will never be alone"

5. Curse My Name
The tenure of kings and their magistrates
By good men it must be deposed
The convenant made can be voided at once
Disanoint him, take his crown

They plead for their king
And they pity their lord
Put him to death, that's what I say

Though never so just these dancing divines
Endue him with reason and grace
They're gibberish
Words dissemble the facts
God's will
They falsely will claim

Let him curse my name
On these blood stained pages of misery
Let him call me a tyrant so cruel
Let him curse my name
But remember the truth

So there they come
 From everywhere
They witness revenge
Hear them calling
"You're laden with blood
It's spilled everywhere
And sorrow's everlasting

Oh you'll be aware now
That trial is near
It's close at hand
The masquerade is over
It ends
Remove his crown
and bring him down
Now we shall mourn no longer
Our prayers they've been heard
There's no more league
That will bind us to the tyrant
Our voices shall be heard
Cause we won't take it anymore

And we're one we are the nation
And we're one we are the law"

Falsely they praise
Deify his majesty
"He's blessed the anointed's
Fulfilling god's will"
Curse them all
No further he's king
Providence brought him straight into our hands

Let him curse my name
On these blood stained pages of misery
Let him call me a tyrant so cruel
Let him curse my name But remember the truth

Now let him appear
There's joy in the air
Now witness a new age is dawning
In trouble alone
He's facing despair
Awaiting his bitter ending

We all know he's guilty as charged
By punishment due to his crime
We sacrifice the wicked king
Acknowledged by scriptures and law

Let him curse my name
On these blood stained pages of misery
Let him call me a tyrant so cruel
Let him curse my name But remember the truth
On these blood stained pages of misery
Let him call me a tyrant so cruel
Let him curse my name But remember the truth
We won't take it anymore
Our voice it shall be heard
But I will remember the truth
We won't take it anymore
Our voice it shall be heard
But I will remember the truth

6. Valkyries
To the gods of the north, I pray
And raise my cup for the fallen ones
Then I cry
In Valhalla they'll sing

Rain
Red blood keeps pouring down
Come Valkyries, join me on that final ride

Here I lie bleeding
Odin, I await thee

The battle rages on

New lines they're weaving
The future, the past and the present
They're one
They will reveal their mask
To show me a way to survive
This bitter war

Soon it will be over
He will be the one
We'll weave in

And terror will now rule these lands

When the battle is lost
And the slain ones are chosen
Valkyries will guide us home
When the battle is lost
And the slain ones are chosen
Valkyries will guide us home

Destiny
A spinning wheel
The path of glory
Round and round
come join us
On your final ride to Asgard
Let's move on fast
allfather waits
So let's heed the final call

For now
We leave this world behind
It's over

All glory to the brave
Still blood will rain
Through storm and fire
Let war winds reign
It's the feast for the crows

Follow the light
Just follow the light
Or fade away

Soon it will be over
He will be the one
We'll weave in
and terror will now rule these lands

When the battle is lost
And the slain ones are chosen
Valkyries will guide us home
When the battle is lost
And the slain ones are chosen
Valkyries will guide us home

We'll keep on weaving
We're crushing through lines
With our battering swords
We're marching on
Assign the brave
To survive
This bitter war

Soon it will be over
He will be the one
We'll weave in

And terror will now rule these lands

When the battle is lost
And the slain ones are chosen
Valkyries will guide us home
When the battle is lost
And the slain ones are chosen
Valkyries will guide us home
We'll heed the final call
A call to arms
The valkyries will guide us home

The finally I hear them say
Carry on
For Valhalla awaits you

7. Control The Divine
For what I was
I'm doomed to be
The tempter and the secret foe
Cause I am hell and hell is me
Pure hate will grow

Still I claim to be the chosen one and
still I claim
This is rebellion rising

First amongst equals
We're bound to no law
There's no one before us
Ethereal sons
Now disobey
Awake and arise
You'll be free

How can we take it away
From someone who has no right?
No right to control the divine
Night shall invade
Suspicion awakes
Wherefore he's grater than I

Stay silent
Until the end of the world
So just like slaves we may deem him
Dead silence
Until the end of the world
Hence from this moment we're doomed
I feel
It hurts though
Disburdened spirits we will be
I've learned my lesson
Pure and sore
And offer divine
We're far beneath them

They consider us slaves
They steal our pride
Don't trust them blindly
Cause truth they conceal
As it seems
I'll reign
Cause here in my tower
Impassioned, I'll show you a way
I can feel your hallowed rage
Now enter my realm
Awake and arise, you'll be free

How can we take it away
 From someone who has no right?
No right to control the divine
Night shall invade
Suspicion awakes
Wherefore he's grater than I

Descend - just keep moving
all things shall proceed
It's freedom you're choosing
Preserve our hate
Eternalize
Awake and arise
To be free

How can we take it away
From someone who has no right?
No right to control the divine
Night shall invade
Suspicion awakes
Wherefore he's grater than I
How can we take it away
From someone who has no right?
No right to control the divine
Night shall invade
Suspicion awakes
Wherefore he's grater than I

8. War Of The Thrones
Nothing will grow here
Icy fields - blackened sorrow
Legacy of a lost mind
Feed my void
What you're waiting for

I'm too late
It is more than a game
The river reveals
Now I'm in between these lines
I cannot escape it seems
Sail on, my friend

All I ever feel is
All I ever see is
Walls they fall
When the march of the Others begins

All I ever feel is
All I ever see is
Rise and fall
When the War of the Thrones shall begin

While I sit there in silence
Come and talk to me
I can't free my mind
It is all I'm begging for

While I sit there in silence

Will it ever end?
Will I find what I'm longing for?
Will I ever walk out of shadows so grey?
I'm condemned, I am hallowed
Icy fields they won't hurt anymore

Will you walk with me?
Any further
There at world's end
It's me
I sing

I cannot escape it seems
Sadly I sing

All I ever feel is
All I ever see is
Walls they fall
When the march of the Others begins

All I ever feel is
All I ever see is
Rise and fall
When the War of the Thrones shall begin

Away
Watch the river it flows
Now and ever
I cannot believe in more
And now my time will come
Carry on

Will I ever learn from the past?
Will I fade away?
Will I ever stay where the shadows will grow?
There is luck at the gallows
I will free my mind
Soon it will show

Let it rain
There'll be no spring
My dream is a mirror
It reveals a matter of lies

All I ever feel is
All I ever see is
Rise and fall
When the War of the Thrones will begin

All I ever feel is
All I ever see is
Rise and fall
When the War of the Thrones has begun

Leave a fee for the tillerman
And the river behind

9. A Voice In The Dark
A sense of denial
Come witness my trial
The crow has turned into a liar
I'll live, I may die
I've failed though I've tried
But finally I fly

It is the fool
Who puts faith in false saviors
The innocent understands
He's still falling

And furthermore
He's now aware
“Come spread your wings
Awake now”
The enemy within
Will soon appear

You're trapped in my mind
Ask for the key
Don't search for fine lines
There's no release

Though I can feel its presence
There's a sign to reveal
Then after all
I'm sure I'll keep on falling

They send a sign
When dead winter will come again
There from the ruins I will rise

Fear the voice in the dark
Be aware now
Believe in dark wings and dark words
The shadow returns
Fear the voice in the dark
Be aware now
Black shadows they hide and they wait
But they soon will return

It will never be the same
And nothing remains
I can't find a way
But I'm facing it
Oh there will be no savior

I can foresee all the pain
They are about to creep in
“Curse me, hate me, hurt me, kill me”
Oh they will rest no longer

“Paralyzed and frozen
Free your mind
You're broken
Paralyzed and frozen
Learn to roam
Don't look back”

On stunning fields of mayhem
I will find no relief
It's just a dream
I wish that I could tell you

The vision fades
There is no sanctuary
What will go up
Surely comes down

Fear the voice in the dark
Be aware now
Believe in dark wings and dark words
The shadow returns
Fear the voice in the dark
Be aware now
Black shadows they hide and they wait
But they soon will return

In vain
Still I don't understand
So talk to me again
Why do I fear these words?
What keeps holding me back?

I hear a voice
It comes from everywhere
“Now find a way
Cause you're the key
Begin to understand”

The descending ends
Now I know I won't fly again
On through the mist, I'm facing ground

Fear the voice in the dark
Be aware now
Believe in dark wings and dark words
The shadow returns
Fear the voice in the dark
Be aware now
Black shadows they hide and they wait
But they soon will return

10. Wheel Of Time
Now there is no end
The wheel will turn, my friend

I'm in flames
Cause I have touched the light
It pulls me son
we shall be one
Forevermore
That's all I want
It's all I need
Everything is fixed
There's no chance
There's no choice

It's calling me
"Saidin"
So precious and sweet
My mind keeps fading away

It's scratching deeper
My sole reliever
How can I find you now?

Passing through the flames
I see
How terror will rise
It soon will be over
Oh Father of lies
Like foul winds at twilight
It's coming over me
What was and what will be?
What is?
I don't know

Driving me insane
Just feel the heat
Madness creeps in
I'll tear it down

There's no end
Wheel of time
It keeps on spinning
There's no beginning
Turn the wheel of time
There's no beginning
Just keep on spinning

Light - it binds me
Light - it blinds me
Light - it finds me
Light denies me now

I creep along
So desperate and tired
Let me ask you
Why?
I am what I am
Prophecies I am the chosen
"Taveren"
The flame will grow
Feel the heat
I'll keep on breathing
After all there's no tomorrow

Wheel of time
Save my soul, find a way
And if I fail, will it all be over
Oh wheel of time

The vision
So fleeting and vague
Once again I will bring down the mountain
One last glimpse
It is constantly slipping away

The young man said
"I will never give up"
The inner war
I can hold against it
My mind, my mind
My mind's in darkness

The young man says
"I will never give in"
The prophecy Behold It's true
I conquer the flame
To release the insane
I'm crying
I cannot erase
I'm the dragon reborn
and in madness
I soon shall prevail
Twice I'll be marked and
Twice I shall live
The heron sets my path
And name me true
Twice I'll be marked and
Twice I shall die
My memory's gone
But twice I pay the price

wheel of time
Save my soul
find a way
May it be as the pattern has chosen
Oh, wheel of time
Turn the wheel of time
It keeps on spinning
There's no beginning
There's no end, wheel of time
There's no beginning
Just keep no spinning

Shine on
Embrace and deny me
Turn on, wheel of time
Shine on
You've burnt, now guide me
Weave on, wheel of time
Oh wheel of time

12. Curse My Name - Demo
[Special Edition Track]Welcome to my world and then see me there.
The glory that no one denies.
You've conquered death, that's all I know.
All my love long run down.

Bring in the lion, the wizard and king.
Bring out the dead or the loved ones.
'Cause I know we all live a lie.
Where do they really belong?
We're living a life of glorious dreams.
The once and future king.

Let them curse my name
on these bloodstained pages of misery.
And the torment will never let loose.
Let them curse my name
and remember the truth.

Down below where the stories are flying high
they watch your step and then fly back to me.
All my magic's fulfilled in rhymes.
Rearranged for the way.
So I'll let you feel the way for a while,
but I will not let you down.

Alone I want to be, there's no sign of Avalon.
The elder, they all know, there's no sign of Avalon.
No tomorrow I will sing.
No tomorrow I will sing.

There I walk.
I'm afraid it's not on me.
Walk in the shadows.
My piper will come.
Curse the wind. They know my name.
Lovers don't go there, these passes to me.

Let them curse my name
on these bloodstained pages of misery.
And tomorrow will never come true.
Let them curse my name
and remember the truth.

They don't like to see.
They don't want to be.
Don't ask me what they long for.
Suddenly time runs backwards.

All my magic's fulfilled in rhymes.
Rearranged for the way.
So I'll let you feel the way for a while,
but I will not let you down.

Now I know we all live a lie,
no matter her whithering wings.
And while we walk in pouring rain
life's passing by.

Let them curse my name
on these bloodstained pages of misery.
Let them turn all the pages we knew.
Let them curse my name
and remember the truth.

The death of the king will come.
For all that I knew you would come.
It's part of the bigger seed
but we will stand proud
to my beloved time.

13. Tanelorn Demo

Here on my own I'm wasting life so sweet.
My shadow soul, my war cry.
Someone gets near.

Deceiver.

I'm you.
You find me on your way.
There's nothing more to say.
You find me in travelling wake of the past.

Tales so wrong, they come from everywhere.
Now call the spirit of the past
and we will find its heart.

Descending here and the whole world will cry again.
The fallen angel's time to rise.

Fear the man in the dark.
He is calling.
When shadows they reign on the field
their kingdom will come.
Fear the man in the dark.
He is calling.
When shadows they reign on the field.
I'm the Dragon reborn.

1. Valhalla
Winds of Odin guide us
Over violent seas, the silent grave 
Gods of thunder
Roaring, crackling power
In flashing light, they pound the night

Rising winds and howling fury
Towering shadows crashing down

As we awaken and behold 
The crystal seas and ships of gold 
To the colored winds our sails arise 
The distant shore before us lies 
Winds of Odin whisper 
Over silent waves, no trace remains

We have found a new horizon 
Far beyond the stars that shine above 
Thrashing wings valkyries rising
To the hollowed halls of Valhalla

Valhalla, Valhalla

Valhalla, Valhalla
Valhalla, Valhalla

2. Dragon Lady
The full moon is burning
In the crimson sky
A wicked witches laughter
Echoes in the night
The wolves of doom howl
A warning to the wind
Red eyes of fire
Haunting your dreams again

Watch out her poison heart
She's a dragon lady
Look into her crystal ball
It tells all 
Watch out now she's breathing fire
She's a dragon lady
Look into her crimson eyes
Say good-bye!

Watch out her poison heart
She's a dragon lady
Look into her crystal ball
It tells all 
Watch out now she's breathing fire
She's a dragon lady
Look into her crimson eyes
Say good-bye!

Dragon lady wants to meet you
Step into her lair
Death waits in the shadows
Enter the fire and challenge the witch
If you dare
Enter the fire and challenge the witch
If you dare
No, no, no, no

Watch out her poison heart
She's a dragon lady
Look into her crystal ball
It tells all 
Watch out now she's breathing fire
She's a dragon lady
Look into her crimson eyes
You shall die!

She's a dragon lady

Watch out
Dragon lady wants to meet you

3. Heart of Steel
Your love hides like a dark star
Shining, hidden in fear
Strangers feeding upon your soul
Call me on through the darkness
Hold me deep in your heaven
Touch me with fingers of velvet blue
Fingers of mysty blue...
Feelings deep as the ocean 
Cold waves whisper their warning
Danger walks with a fragile heart

Got to have a heart of steel 
Heart of steel
Yeah, heart of steel

You journey through my mind 
Over the walls of pain
Angels of lust guard my domain 
While dark eyes shine in the mirror 
Searching for someone 
Strangers, cold as the winter wind
Fade away 

Got to have a heart of steel
Heart of steel
Got to have a heart of steel
Heart of steel Lonely freedom, eyes on pain
Tears will fall like silent rain
Hearts will shatter, feelings fade
Somehow it always seems the same 

My love hides like a dark star
Laughing, hidden in silence
Strangers cold as the winter wind
Fade away
Feelings deep as the ocean 
Cold waves whisper their warning
Danger walks with a fragile heart
Walks with a fragile heart 

Got to have a heart of steel
Heart of steel
Got to have a heart of steel
Heart of steel

Cause the feelings come and go
And you never really know 
If th eling's ever real
So you got to have a heart of steel
v You got to have a heart of steel

4. Azrael
Never been in the hell before
Now I'm falling, falling
Heaven's behind the door
And they're calling me again
Hidden beyond the light
And the darkness finds me
Help me escape tonight 
Oh, I must find Azrael...

I am the darkness
Hiding within your mind
Walking beside you

I lock the gates to hell
I toll the final bell
I am forever

I am the blinding light
Probing the endless night
There's no escaping me

Wake in your darkest dreams 
Go ahead and try to scream
No one can hear you now

Stare in the raven's eye
Your time has come to die
Welcome to my world

Stand at the end of space
Reach out to touch my face
I am omega

Azrael

I hold the lion's mane
I come in crimson rain
Purging the dark sky

I am the master 
Guide to your chosen fate
I am Valhalla

Azrael, angel of mercy
Azrael, angel of mercy
Yeah

Beware my eyes'll find you
And see into your heart
And if you hold the evil
I'll rip you all apart
I'll cast your soul to Satan
Die by holy fire
Rise and stand before me
Burning on the pyre. Burn.

Fly on the wings of glory 
Burn in the depths of hell
Your life creates the doorway
Death holds the key

Azrael, angel of mercy
Azrael, angel of mercy
Azrael, angel of mercy
Azrael, angel of mercy
Yeah

5. Mayday
Countdown to zero, ignition
Warning
Rising in smoke, glowing fire

Thrusting into the sky of the morning
Warning
All system down

Mayday!
Mayday!
Mayday!
Mayday!

In search of the glory
They reach for the stars
With honor and courage
They die!

Mayday!
Mayday!
Mayday!

Thunderous roar of the engine
Screaming
They fill the sky, burn trails

Down through the clouds falling faster
Disaster 
Taking their lives

Mayday!
Mayday!
Mayday!
Mayday!

6. Queen of the Masquerade
Woman - madame of mystery
Heavens anger, devils daughter
Lady - black widow strange and cruel
Is it true?

Do you still need hearts to bleed
To be satisfied?
Gathering prey, deadly webs
Hang in dark disguise
Showing no mercy, insatiable appetite
Down, down to your knees
Bow before her majesty

Hail - to the queen of the masquerade
Deep in your heart she feeds
Hail - to the queen of the masquerade
Bow to her majesty

Look out

Slowly, crawling feeding on your heart
So many kings with broken dreams, 
The tyrants rule, the dragon pleads
Tell you man she'll tear you all apart 
In chambers of the wicked queen 
The silence falls, the feast begins

Moon-shining eyes, clinging cobwebs
Above her bed
Spider smooth legs across faces
On silken web
Feeling the sting of her venomous
Clinching bite
Down, down to your knees
Bow before her majesty

Hail - to the queen of the masquerade
Deep in your heart she feeds
Hail - to the queen of the masquerade
Bow to her majesty

Her majesty queen

Do you still need hearts to bleed
To be satisfied?
Gathering prey, deadly webs
Hang in dark disguise
Showing no mercy, insatiable appetite
Down, down to your knees
Bow before her majesty

Hail - to the queen of the masquerade 
Deep in your heart she feeds
Hail - to the queen of the masquerade
Bow to her majesty
Hail - to the queen of the masquerade
Deep in your heart she feeds
Hail - to the queen of the masquerade
Bow to her majesty
Hail - to the queen of the masquerade
Hard in your heart that bleeds
Hail...

8. Lost Reflections
Locked in this attic 
Been here so many years
Shanna won't set me free
She says I'm evil 
But then she doesn't know 
I'm not pretending, no, not me

Full moon's reflecting
A face in the mirror 
Twisted and bleeding
No, you can't be real, no you're 
All in my mind
Shades of insanity, you're not me
You're not me

Life in the attic
I like my rocking chair
Staring in shadows
Crouched in the corner
Waiting for something
Laughing at nothing
No one there

And on and on I wonder is there more 
What is life beyond the attic door 
The full moon in my eyes 
Is all that's real 
The mirror's lost reflection is in me

Life in the attic
Life in the attic
Life in the attic
Life in the attic

Cobwebs and dusty dreams 
Sharp knives and hollow screams 
Wide eyes of terror 
Clawing the attic door 
Can't take it anymore
You better go away!

You're lyin'
Hurry
Ah, ah, ah, ah
Who's there?
No one there
You're not me!

1. Lady of Winter
Her wraith rides the crystal sky
of changing colors
The glowing clouds are moving through
the winter night
Snow is falling silver shining
Through the shadows deep blue dreaming
eyes of diamond shine
Lady of winter, turning to rain
White world of wonder, fading away
Bright beams of violent light
break the silence
Melting colors crushed beneath the waves
of rolling flames
Seasons turning, burning burning
Lady of winter, song in the wind
Melody whispers, seasons will change
Lady of winter, turning to rain
White world of wonder, fading away
Lady of winter, song in the wind
Melody whispers, seasons will change

2. Red Sharks
Trapped in their world no free passage to leave
You accept their tyrannical dream
You pray to their gods not to your chosen ones
Freedom's clutched in the jaw of red kings
Give us your freedom, we'll give you hell
Hear no evil, see no evil, speak no evil
Give us your freedom, we'll give you hell
Hear no evil, see no evil, speak no evil
Glory to red sharks
Answer to your red dictators
Feeding from your dreams
Cast into a sea of red sharks
Holding the power a hand that grips fate
Stripping from you all but fear
Hovering vultures like demons feed
On all who bow to their communist scheme
Give us your freedom, we'll give you hell
Hear no evil, see no evil, speak no evil
Give us your freedom, we'll give you hell
Hear no freedom, see no freedom, speak no freedom
Glory to red sharks
Answer to your red dictators
Feeding from your dreams
Cast into a sea of red sharks
Bloody red sharks

3. Painted Skies
When she's sad the world is lonely
Silver clouds are crying only
for the pain she feels
so deep inside
The love she thought would save her
has somehow now enslaved her
To a dream she though she wanted
to come true
Spread your wings you can fly
But the dove is never free
In painted skies that shade the color
of your dream
Only nightmares are real
Confusion conceals the only reason
for the feelings you can't hide
When she smiles the world it shimes
But the silver clouds are only there
to hide the distant storm
that's coming soon
The love she let surround her
has become the waves that drown her
in the sea of everchaning
warmth and cold
Spread your wings you can fly
But the dove is never free
In painted skies that shade the color
of your dream
Only nightmares are real
Confusion conceals the only reason
for the feelings you can't hide
You can fly
Spread your wings you can fly
But the dove is never free
In painted skies that shade the color
of your dream
Only nightmares are real
Confusion conceals the only reason
for the feelings you can't hide
When the nightmares ensue
All that you can do is paint your sky
another brighter shade of blue
Spread your wings you can glide
above the violent storms
that plague your life
You paint the picture blue or grey
Fly away

4. Masque of the Red Death
The pain lingers on beyond these castle walls
The red death is taking them all
while the king and his court dance the night away
at the masquerade
The hour of midnight grows near
Masque of the red death
No one is safe from the poisonous plague
that you breed
Dance while you may in the dark of the room
with the stranger
Laugh while you may, laugh at the danger
Is the a message from god
or fate guiding hideous hands?
Won't you show us your face
Masque of the red death
No one is safe from the poisonous plague
that you breed
Masque of the red death
No one is saved, no one remembers your name
On and on, one by one we fall
into the bleeding arms of the stranger
Ripping the masque from your face
I feel your disease running
through my veins
A new king of death threatens us all
Masque of the red death
No one is safe from the poisonous plague
that you breed
Masque of the red death
The price that you pay for your lust
may be your life

5. In Dark Places
Waves pound the gloomy shores, I watch them roll
across my feet so warm
I know she's waiting there for me
In ancient rhymes she whispers in the wind
a strange and haunting melody
As it fills the silence, I feel the shivers cold
embrace my soul
From the deep she beckons me
promising eternity
In a world where nothing's real
beyond this realm of light and dreams
You, mystic moon it's you who rules the night
breathing life into my dreams
I see your face in nightmares shining bright
So, it's fare to you my sunlit world
so full of hate and misery
You see I can't take it anymore
From my sleep you beckon me
promising eternity
In your world of mystery
to your realm of harmony
In dark places
In dark places we will be
forever beyond the light
In dark places we will be free
from the pain that fills our lives
Through arching moonbeams of light we glide
in bending shadows of warm starlight
Angels of colors light the night as they fly
transcending into the electric sky
In dark places
In dark places we will be
forever beyond the light
In dark places we will be free
from the pain that fills our lives
In dark places we will be
forever beyond the light
In dark places we will see
worlds we've always dreamed

6. Where Dragons Rule
The dragons rise from the sea of flames
Through the night you can hear them marching
breathing fire, wings of steel
By the thousands they take to the sky
shadow us all
In a world
Where dragons rule
All across the sky they soar
burning trails into the night
Laser eyes gleaming death~ seek and destroy
Like shooting stars they fall from the sky
Death from above
In a world between myth and strange reality
In a world where dragons rule
Mission: Kill
We kill for the dragon~ We have no reason
Mission: Kill
We die for the dragon~ Is there a reason?
March!
Where dragons rule

7. Lonely
She awakens from a dream to a silent room
where shadows speak of memories
Another sleepless night,
afraid to face the day
It seems so long ago she shared the love
she feels so deep inside
Her love will never die
but still she feels so lonely...
Lonely in Love
She wakes up to another day
with everything going wrong
She wonders where she would be
if she had ever seen his face
She turns on the radio,
but it's playing that same old song
She's pouring another drink
to drown away the memory of it all
She can't wait another night
Take another day
She doesn't want to be
Lonely in Love
There's a feeling she can't explain
that no one can understand
She just needs to get away
but there's nowhere that she can go
Tomorrow's so far away
She's longing for yesterday
If she could just turn back time
She wants to leave the world behind
She can't wait another night
Take another day
She doesn't want to be
Lonely in Love
The night will fade, the sun will shine
a new day
And light the way for you to find
New Love

8. Burning Bridges
We've all been hurt before
you know the pain
And just to love is not enough
So many times I've had to turn away
from love I know could be so true to me
Now I stand alone in my dark and lonely world
surrounded by this cold embrace of jealousy
No feeling remains, like a restless heart
naked in the frozen winds of sorrow
Now I feel the bridges burning
Flames reflecting in my eyes
The feeling much too cold to share
Another broken heart to spare
Smoke clouds dreams I've left behind
I never meant to bring you sorrow
I never meant to cause you pain
I know how much it burns so deep inside
It's burning me too
Leave me silent in the morning light
Hold me close until the morning comes again
I need you so bad
Tell me lies if truth reveals your love
Feel the flames are rising
The bridge is falling, the bridge is burning
I never knew that I would need you
I always thought you would be there
Now I feel the bridges burning
Flames reflecting in my eyes
I never meant to bring you sorrow
I never meant to cause you pain
Still thinking of you
You know I love you... still

9. Eternal World
Down through the valley of shadows we go
into the canyon of moonlight below
Stairs of stone descending
Down where the magic river's bending
Down the river we go
To the sea of gold
(Where?) things are not as they seem
(Why?) you are not as you were
Behold eternal world
where time has no meaning
reality is dreaming
Feel your flesh is melting
Feel you spirit twisting
Feel it ripping at your mind
There's no time for praying
Feel your soul is pleading
Welcome to eternal world

10. Transcendence
The snow was gently falling
A white mist filled the air
I hear the cold wind calling
Something's waiting there
I stand alone in silence
upon the mountain high
I'm waiting for the spirits
Eyes upon the sky
They whisper in my visions
They haunt me in my dreams
They've shown me worlds that shimmer
and peaceful fields of green
Try to find you sky
Your world within yourself
In death I've found the answer
In death I've found the answer
In death I live again
Fear not the reaper's blade
It does not mean the end
It never really ends

1. Strange and Beautiful
Dark eyes shine with strange desire
Velvet cold skin tastes like fire
Something in her eyes
Make you need to be inside her
Something in her twisted smile
Sends shivers down my spine
Round and round and down she goes
Where she stops nobody really knows
Love to her is pain to you
Tell you man she's strange and beautiful
Take it easy baby now you love is killing me
Your love is killing me
You can feel her deep inside
But you will never come to understand her
Round and round and down she goes
Where she stops nobody really knows
Love to her is pain to you
Tell you man she's strange and beautiful
Wicked and wonderful
Dark eyes shine with a strange desire
Velvet cold skin tastes like fire
Strange and beautiful
Strange and beautiful
Round and round and down she goes
Where she stops nobody really knows
Love to her is pain to you
Tell you man she's strange and beautiful
Cold eyes burn with a dark desire
Velvet strange skin tastes like fire
Ladies and gentlemen welcome one and all
Come see the lady of your dreams
The show's about to start
Round and round and down she goes
Where she stops nobody really knows
Love to her is just a game
Tell you man she's strange
Strange and beautiful
Strange and beautiful

2. Promise Land
Got a ragin' fever, losin control

3. Love and Dreams
You are the shining, I am the star
You are the burning, I am the fire
Burning bright for all to see
Forever together I know we'll be
Take my hand lady walk with me
Through these fields of love and dreams
You and I were meant to be together
Two hearts will beat as one forever
You and I were meant to be
Forever together I know we'll be
Spread your wings lady fly with me
Across the sky of love and dreams
Your love is like the warmth of the fire
Fills my heart with a burning desire
To give my love to you
You are my dream, you are my lady
You are the only one in my life
You are my heaven, you are my baby
You are the shining light
You are the sun
Shine on, shine on me
Shine on, shine on me
Two ships passing in the night
Have found each other in the light
Close your eyes now drift away with me
Across the sea of love and dreams
You are my dream, you are my lady
You are the only one in my life
You are my heaven, you are my baby
You are the shining light
You are the sun
Shine on, shine on me
Shine on, shine on me

4. The Chant
In the daytime and in the night
I hear The Chant coming from all around me
Like a blind man who never had his sight
Wishing he could see the light
Desperate ways, desperate days
Are the times we're living in
Looking out, finding out
Realizing that we're living in the last days of living
Chanting around the world
I can hear the voices begging for mercy
Save us from our sins
Can you hear the voices begging for mercy
Through a window looking out to see
What's waiting for me
Destination I know the way
You can follow me
Desperate ways, desperate days
Are the times we're living in
Looking out, finding out
Realizing that we're living in the last days of living
Chanting around the world
I can hear the voices begging for mercy
Save us from our sins
Can you hear the voices begging for mercy
Desperate ways, desperate days
Are the times we're living in
Looking out, finding out
Realizing that we're living in the last days of living
Chanting around the world
I can hear the voices begging for mercy
Save us from our sins
Can you hear the voices begging for mercy

5. Dance on Fire
Alright, hold tight
Gonna take you for a ride
Inside the endless depths of my love
Inside outside
Through the doorways of your mind
Into the shadows of my soul
Ooh, something in the way you move that moves me
Ooh, something in the way you sway
The way you make love to me
Come dance with
Feel my desire
I'll set you free
Take you higher and higher
Burn with me I'm gonna make you dance on fire
Dance- dance on fire
Dance- come ad dance with me
Alright, hold tight
Don't you bring me down tonight
I'm flying high on your love
Inside, outside
Through the windows of your eyes
Into the colors of your soul
Ooh, something in the way you move that moves me
Ooh, something in the way you glide
The way you slide right thru me
Come burn with me
Feel my desire
I'll set you free
Make you dance on fire
Feel the flames they'll takle you higher and higher
Dance- dance on fire
Dance- come and dance with me
Blue-eyed angel with a devil's smile

Ooh, something in the way you move that moves me
Ooh, something in the way you sway
The way you make love to me

Feel my desire

Take you higher and higher
Burn with me I'm gonna make you dance on fire
Dance- dance on fire
Dance- come and dance with me

6. Song for Angels
Innocence is fragile like the wind
Cold hearts can tear it down
It's hard to find some sanctuary
I know you're feelin' like the world
Is on your shoulders
And you won't survive if it gets any colder
Angels- wait for tomorrow
Before you smile you gotta cry sometimes
Angels- a new day will follow
Even angels need to learn how to fly
Liste close to the child inside you
Beggin' to be set free
you've lost your way
And your heart is needing shelter
I know you feel the walls are
Closing all around
Hold on, it won't be long
Before you break 'em down
Angels- wait for tomorrow
Before you smile you gotta cry sometimes
Angels- a new day will follow
Even angels need to learn how to fly
Believe in all you dreams
And reach for the sky
So hard all alone
Fightin' thru the pain
Some day you'll stand up
Straong and unafraid
And then you'll see the sun
Right behind the rain
Spread your wings
Angels- wait for tomorrow
Before you smile you gotta cry sometimes
Angels- a new day will follow
Even angels need to learn how to fly

7. In the Mood
You think you know me
I may look just like an ordinary man to you
But there's something about me
I think it's time you knew
I can see you don't believe in me
Well, well honey that's allright
Tonight you'll see... the real me
I change at night now, don't be afraid
It's just in the full moonlight
I rearrange
Don't run, can't hide, love bites hard tonight
Better lock the door to your heart
Don't scream, don't move let me get you in the mood
I need to taste your warm sweet love
Come dance with me my virgin child
To the haunting sound of my dark magic lullaby
let me show you how to feel the way I feel
Forevermore, look into my eyes
I can see you don't believe in me
Well, well honey that's allright
Tonight you'll believe
It's no fantasy, come closer to me
It's time to change now, don't be afraid
You'll find the pain will soon go away
Oh yes I can feel it coming on
At last the time has come
Oh yeah you're a sweet little sacrifice
In the name of love
Don't run, can't hide, love bites hard tonight
Better lock the door to your heart
Don't scream, don't move let me get you in the mood
I need to taste your warm sweet love
Can;t you feel the ecstasy
Soon you will belong to me
I'm right behind you all the time- run!!
Don't scream, don't move let me get you in the mood
Oh your sweet love tastes so good
I'm in the mood... again

8. Starchamber
Deep blue in ultraviolet
I'm the pilot of these stars
My world is in slow motion
Frozen ocean rain of fire
We make love
And as we do it's strange and violent
I feel you
Coming through in waves of ultraviolet
Unlock the door to your mind
Let's see how hugh you can fly
Come on, come on I'll take you all

9. Deep Inside Your Heart
She waits by the window
Counting the stars that fall
Silence becomes her only friend
As the nights grow long
Keep my love baby deep inside your heart
You know I don't want to leave you
But it's time to go
I'm always there babe by your side
Whenever we're apart
You know I love you evermore
I will be there by by your side
Deep inside your heart
I'll always love you
He looks through the window
Watching the city lights rushing by
His ears still ring as the engine
Whines into the sleepless night
Starlight, star bright, first star I see tonight
I wish I may, I wish I might
Be with you tonight
I'm always there babe by your side
Whenever we're apart
You know I love you evermore
I will be there by by your side
Deep inside your heart
Now and forever I am yours
Keep my baby deep inside your heart
You know I don't want to leave you
I want you to know
I'm always there babe by your side
Whenever we're apart
You know I love you evermore
I will be there by by your side
Deep inside your heart
Now and forever I am yours
Deep inside your heart

10. Make You Love Me

11. Far Away
Sleep my lady
Wake and do not shed a tear for me
You knew someday that I would have to leave you
Lonely highway
Morning sun will find me far away
You know that if I could I would stay with you
I'm on my way now... I'm on my way
Endless highway
Reaches out to touch the morning sky
The desert wind is rushing through my window
And far away I know she is rising
And far away I know waits for me
And far away she is crying
If there was a way babe
You know that I would be there
Sleep my lady
You know someday we will meet again
We'll dance beneath the moon, dream of forever
It seems so far away
That day, just seems so far away
Sleep my sweet lady
Wake and do not shed a tear for me
You know that I will always love you

1. March To Glory
[Instrumental]

[Music: Arranged by J. Drenning, J. Lords]
[Originally written and recorded by: Enya]

["It is not the critic who counts, nor the one who points out how the strong person stumbled, or where the doer of deeds could have done them better. The credit belongs to those who are actually in the arena; whose faces are marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strive valiantly; who err and come up short again and again; who know the great enthusiasm, the great devotion, and spend themselves in a worthy cause, who at the best know in the end the triumph of high achievement; and who are at the worst, if failing, at least fail while daring greatly; so that their place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who know neither victory nor defeat." - Theodore Roosevelt]

2. War Of The Worlds
[Music: J. Drenning, J. Lords]
[Lyrics: J. Drenning, J. Lords]

From out of the dark we descend upon your small blue world
Millions of miles a way
With blinding speed our destruction rains down on you
To blow you away...
Waiting in shadows of silence for our kiss of death to come
A world in flames
Burned and destroyed beyond all recognition
That only dust remains...

We are the Sons of the Gods who killed the Daughters of Men
And created their souls
Cold black eyes slice through you like razors of fire
War of the Worlds!!

[Chorus:]
War!!
War of the Worlds
War!!
War of the Worlds

[chorus]

[end]

["The last century of the millennium is a mountain, on which three beasts (wars) sleep. The first one will wake up in the beginning of the road (century). And from its throat will go out blood. The Second will wake up in the middle of the road. And from its throat it will come fire. The third will wake up at the end of the road. And from its throat will come the horrible heresy". - Prophecy of Staretz, Russia, 1850.]

3. New World Machine
[Music: J. Drenning, J. Lords]
[Lyrics: B. Martinez, J. Drenning]

I feel I'm becoming mechanized
World spinning before me made computerized
Separate from soul
Giving up control
Kills the man in me
In electric dreams...

From hear to eternity
From now to infinity
Destroyed...we watch you bleed
The New World Machine!!

[Chorus:]
All we are, all we need
Has become the New World Machine

Now it's time to take another step
Neuro-spike insertion cracks the chest
Input data speed
The memory exceeds
The emptiness in me
Fills an endless sea...

From hear to eternity
From now to infinity
Destroyed...we watch you bleed
The New World Machine!!

[lead]

[chorus]

[end]

["For stranger than the last times may seem, the last century of the millennium will overcome all the others. In that period of terror, there will be great spiritual poverty... From the sky the hell will fall... Poisoned clouds will cover the earth. Monstrous machines will dominate the skies. The fire will destroy many cities. The men will finish destroying each other ". - Found in Monastery of Sainte Claire, Perpignan, France, 14th century.]

4. Astronomica
[Music: J. Drenning, J. Lords]
[Lyrics: B. Martinez, J. Drenning]

Focused on eternity
Ancient gaze...into the morning sun
Tell me now...What do you see?
Hiding...Celestial mysteries
I See...
Astronomica...

Years of light away
Second sister to the eternal sun
I can't believe my eyes
That the prophecies have come
Stretched beyond the limits
Out into the unknown
No words that I can give it
Except "my mind is blown"

[Chorus:]
World's spinning round in space
Lonely star without a face
Left by ourselves we trace
Our footsteps back
To Astronomica...

A twinkle in the eye of a past life's memory
Something that I used to think...
Someone I used to be...
I see...

[chorus]

[chorus]

I can't believe my eyes
That the prophecies have come...

["There will be signs in the sun, moon and stars. The sun will be darkened, and the moon will not give its light; the stars will fall from the sky, and the heavenly bodies will be shaken. On the earth, nations will be in anguish and perplexity at the roaring and tossing of the sea. Men will faint with terror, apprehensive of what is coming on the world, for the heavenly bodies will be shaken."  - Luke 21: 25-26; Matthew 24:29]

5. Edge Of Forever
[Music: J. Drenning, J. Lords]
[Lyrics: B. Martinez, J. Drenning]

I lay back to rest my weary eyes
Dream of better days and of bluer skies
Safe inside my sleep I feel my soul scream
I would stay here forever if I could only dream...

And the world keeps turning faster
Still I reach for the unknown
For a handful of hope
On the Edge of Forever...

Dust collects on my face once alive with a glow
It dulls the perception of life as we used to know
All I keep thinking is how will they cope?
When my time has come
Like dust into earth, without a trace
Does my body go setting me free

And the world keeps turning faster
Still I reach for the unknown
For a handful of hope
On the Edge of Forever...

[Chorus:]
Oceans of sand and their destiny
Alive in the waves of an endless sea
Some of us fall, some of us fly, most of us live to try
To reach the Edge of Forever...

6. Touch The Sun
[Music: J. Drenning, J. Lords]
[Lyrics: B. Martinez, J. Drenning]

Looking down upon your world
Desperate changes it goes through
My black-eyed point of view...
Though you think you know my face
Occupying space (is what)
Brings me here to you...

Dark clouds fill your mind with memories we design
Mask the fear of evil you can't conceive
Transversed through time and space
"There is no God" to save your race
We harvest the worlds we need...

With dark eyes we steal your minds with memories deep inside
You hide in fear from terror you can't conceive
Bending time and space
"We are the Gods" of your race
We harvest the worlds that we need...

[Chorus:]
If we could only Touch The Sun
To dream is not enough
The world is on our hands...

[chorus]

[end]

["At the end of the Millennium, the signals and the number will appear in the sky. The iron birds will obscure the sun. The beasts of Apocalypse will come out from the sea. The flames from the hell will surround the Earth. At the same time, the sky will burn and the sea will grow and the lands will be swallowed. And the man will know the truth". - Prophecy of a Saint-Almis Templar]

7. Lucifer's Hammer
[Music: J. Drenning, J. Lords]
[Lyrics: J. Drenning, J. Lords]

I am what you need
I am everything
I will destroy your dreams
I will make you bleed

[repeat verse]

I am genocide
I destroy all life
Slam into your side
Hell and earth collide

[Chorus:]
Slam down my Hammer!!
Black out the sun - as hell and earth collide
Slam down my Hammer!!
Black out the sun - as hell and earth collide

I am oblivion
Angel full of sin

["The second angel sounded his trumpet, and something like a huge mountain (comet), all ablaze, was thrown into the sea. A third of the sea turned into blood, a third of the living creatures in the sea died, and a third of the ships were destroyed." - Rev 8:8-9]

8. The Other Side Of Midnight
[Music: J. Drenning, J. Lords]
[Lyrics: B. Martinez, J. Drenning]

Midnight tolls on the clock downstairs
A reminding voice inside my head that does not care
His rapture keeps me waiting for a life behind the attic door
Footsteps on the stairs...no one there...

I watch my shadow fade to gray
From the warmth of daylights charm
I cower, turn and run away
From a light so bright and warm

With my fading health
I start to cry and cut myself
To watch the blood look silver
In the blessing of the moon...

I sit here in my rocking chair
They've come again to tie me down and wash my hair
Faceless figures on the wall
Haunt me 'til the morning dawn
Behind the Attic door
Why can't they let me go?

Here where devil's roam
Twisted and bleeding all alone
In this hell beyond the light
On the other side of Midnight...

The other side of Midnight!!

I bang my head against the wall
To kill the demons in my soul
I blind myself so I can't see
Evil things inside of me...

You're not me?
Who's there?
Am I evil?

9. Cyber-Christ
[Music: J. Drenning, J. Lords]
[Lyrics: J. Drenning, J. Lords]

I have the power to bend time and space
I stare into you but you don't see my face

Sacrifice the father
Scold the one who sins
Paralyze the daughter
And steal the seed within...

He who gives life everlasting
He keeps your soul in his hands

[Chorus:]
Cyber-Christ - Pray for me
Cyber-Christ - Die for me
Cyber-Christ - On your knees
Cyber Christ - Bleed for me

I am the savior, I'm the one you fear
My resurrection...The end of time is near

Sacrifice the father
Scold the one who sins
Paralyze the daughter
And steal the seed within

[chorus]

He who gives life everlasting
He keeps your soul in his hands

["In the time of the seventh seal, the earth will be an abandoned factory of poisons. And the few wise men that will remain, will not be able to make another thing but to invoke the anger of God, so that the impious beast which will have destroyed the life be destroyed". - The Llibrary of Monastery Neamt, Romania, 19th century.]

10. Cydonia
[Music: J. Drenning, J. Lords]
[Lyrics: B. Martinez, J. Drenning]

God whispered out to me from outer space
His voice echoed then disappeared without a trace...

Beyond the light of the sun...
Beyond the edge of forever...
I hear the angels sing...

[Chorus:]
Cydonia - city I see in dreams
City I see in dreams
Cydonia - shrouded in mystery
You stare out in space all alone

God's eyes stare down at me from outer space
He looked deep in side of me...a lonely place...

Beyond the light of the sun...
Beyond the edge of forever...
I hear the angels sing...

[Chorus:]
Cydonia - City I see in dreams
City I see in dreams
Cydonia - Shrouded in mystery
Cydonia - City I see in dreams
Starlight's majesty
Cydonia - Shrouded in mystery

You stare out in space all alone

1. War Of The Worlds (Remake)
From out of the dark we descend upon your small blue world
Millions of miles a way
With blinding speed our destruction rains down on you
To blow you away...
Waiting in shadows of silence for our kiss of death to come
A world in flames
Burned and destroyed beyond all recognition
That only dust remains...

We are the Sons of the Gods who killed the Daughters of Men
And created their souls
Cold black eyes slice through you like razors of fire
War of the Worlds!!

[Chorus:]
War!!
War of the Worlds
War!!
War of the Worlds

[Chorus]

2. Astronomica (Demo Version)
Focused on eternity
Ancient gaze...into the morning sun
Tell me now...What do you see?
Hiding...Celestial mysteries
I See...
Astronomica...

Years of light away
Second sister to the eternal sun
I can't believe my eyes
That the prophecies have come
Stretched beyond the limits
Out into the unknown
No words that I can give it
Except "my mind is blown"

[Chorus:]
World's spinning round in space
Lonely star without a face
Left by ourselves we trace
Our footsteps back
To Astronomica...

A twinkle in the eye of a past life's memory
Something that I used to think...
Someone I used to be...
I see...

[Chorus]

[Lead]

[Chorus]

I can't believe my eyes
That the prophecies have come...

3. Touch The Sun (Demo Version)
Looking down upon your world
Desperate changes it goes through
My black-eyed point of view...
Though you think you know my face
Occupying space (is what)
Brings me here to you...

Dark clouds fill your mind with memories we design
Mask the fear of evil you can't conceive
Transversed through time and space
"There is no God" to save your race
We harvest the worlds we need...

With dark eyes we steal your minds with memories deep inside
You hide in fear from terror you can't conceive
Bending time and space
"We are the Gods" of your race
We harvest the worlds that we need...

[Chorus:]
If we could only Touch The Sun
To dream is not enough
The world is on our hands...

[Lead]

[Chorus]

4. Dragon Lady (Live Version)
The full moon is burning
In the crimson sky
A wicked witches laughter
Echoes in the night
The wolves of doom howl
A warning to the wind
Red eyes of fire
Haunting your dreams again

Watch out for her poison heart
She's a dragon lady
Look into her crystal ball
It tells all
Watch out now she's breathing fire
She's a dragon lady
Look into her crimson eyes
Say good-bye!

Watch out for her poison heart
She's a dragon lady
Look into her crystal ball
It tells all
Watch out now she's breathing fire
She's a dragon lady
Look into her crimson eyes
Say good-bye!

Dragon lady wants to meet you
Step into her lair
Death waits in the shadows
Enter the fire and challenge the witch
If you dare
Enter the fire and challenge the witch
If you dare
No, no, no, no

Watch out for her poison heart
She's a dragon lady
Look into her crystal ball
It tells all
Watch out now she's breathing fire
She's a dragon lady
Look into her crimson eyes
You shall die!

She's a dragon lady

Watch out
Dragon lady wants to meet you

5. Eternal World (Live Version)
Down through the valley of shadows we go
Into the canyon of moonlight below

Stairs of stone descending
Down where the magic river's bending

Down the river we go
To the sea of gold

(Where?) things are not as they seem
(Why?) you are not as you were

Behold eternal world
Where time has no meaning
Reality is dreaming

Feel your flesh is melting
Feel you spirit twisting
Feel it ripping at your mind
There's no time for praying
Feel your soul is pleading
Welcome to eternal world

1. Invocation Of Apocalyptic Evil
[Instrumental]

2. Valley Of The Damned
On a cold dark winter night hidden by the stormy light
A battle rages for the right for what will become
In the valley of the damned a warrior with sword in hand
Travels fast across the land for freedom he rides

And the sign from the master on high screams aloud and across hear the cry
For the kingdom of fire and ice and the power to be alive
Be strong ride on, carry on through the war
Come along carry on, living for ever more

On the wings of death by the hands of doom
By the darkest light from the darkest moon
Crossing silent seas over mountains high
For we stand as one tonight

On the black wind forever we ride on together
Destroying your evil with freedom our guide
When the master will storm us
He'll stand high before us
Our hearts filled with splendour
Our swords will shine over the light

In the valley of the damned
Days breaks with golden strand
Over pastures green it glows
To where night returns

In the shadows faces appear
Warriors wearing full metal gear
All join together one and all
Before the glorious light

Rise up, gather around
Come and hear what is said
Use your senses open your mind
Don't you ever forget

On the wings of life, by the hands of hope
By the brightest light from the brightest sun
Crossing silent seas over mountains high
To the valley of the damned

On the black wind forever we ride on together
Destroying your evil with freedom our guide
When the master will storm us
He'll stand high before us
Our hearts filled with splendour
Our swords will shine over the light

On the black wind forever we ride on together
Destroying your evil with freedom our guide
When the master will storm us
He'll stand high before us
Our hearts filled with splendour
Our swords will shine over the light

The black wind forever we ride on together
Destroying your evil with freedom our guide
When the master will storm us
He'll stand high before us
Our hearts filled with splendour
Our swords will shine over the light

The black...

3. Black Fire
We come from...
Over the dark horizon sky
With twisted tales of sacrifice
To imagine or believe all the glory of the free

Hunting all day an endless cry
The things I've seen I can't deny
Sinners, saints all mixed in one
The dawn of time has begun

Why can't you see what they're doing to me
Is it fair that I'm dying in vain

Once in a land of sacrifice now only valleys of demise
Shadows of a pale blue moonlight ride the waves of entity

Why can't you see what they're doing to thee
Is it fair that you all die in vain

Ride with the steel and the power of the sword
Stand up and fight now and forever more
Rise through the night sky with daylight's desire
To be free there must be black fire

Through the day and through the night with dragons heart the warrior strikes
This is the day that they'll be known as my enemy

Why can't you see what they're doing
To what we believe in we rise through the pain

Ride with the steel and the power of the sword
Stand up and fight now and forever more
Rise through the night sky with daylight's desire
To be free there must be black fire

We come from distant lands we travel so far
Can you see the bleeding scar
The prizes of life we fail to win
Cause we doubt the power within

Why can't you see what they're doing to
What we believe in we rise through the pain

Ride with the steel and the power of the sword
Stand up and fight now and forever more
Rise through the night sky with daylight's desire
To be free there must be black fire

Black fire...

4. Black Winter Night
Day after day as I bodies slay
And the sun becomes dark in the sky
Everything's lost for this human race
And the dawn of a new age will rise

Rays of sunlight now are gone
Only visions of ice will remain
The fallen ones and forgotten souls
Will rise up over the slain

No more hope as we raise our hands to the sky
No more dreams as the rivers run dry

Everything's lost all is left astray
Only sorrow and sadness remains
Curtains have dropped on our fallen world
And the forces of darkness shall rise

Why can't you see what has happened to thee
Can you not open your eyes
Everything's lost there is no retreat
And the valleys echo with pain

No more hope as we raise our hands to the sky
No more dreams as the rivers run dry

On the endless sea of madness we sail forever more
And the endless tears of sadness towards the distant shores
When the flame has died forever we stand one and all
With the power of the almighty sword

We fight the battle on the fields tonight
To save us from the master of all evil sign
And to the battle on forever standing strong
We feel the fire power of the night warriors

No more tomorrow
Dying of sorrow
Over the mountains and up through the trees
Traveling across seven seas

No more hope as we hold our hands to the sky
No more dreams as the rivers run dry

On the endless seas of madness we sail forever more
And the endless tears of sadness towards the distant shores
When the flame has died forever we stand one and all
With the power of the almighty sword

We fight the battle on the fields tonight
To save us from the master of all evil sign
And to the battle on forever standing strong
We feel the fire power of the night warriors

On the endless seas of madness we sail forever more
And the endless tears of sadness towards the distant shores
When the flame has died forever we stand one and all
With the power of the almighty sword

We'll fight the battle on the fields tonight
To save us from the master of all
We fight the battle on the fields tonight
To save us from the master of all evil sign

And to the battle on
Forever standing strong
We feel the fire
Power of the night warriors

The power of the night warriors...

5. Starfire
Outside on a winter's night as the rain begins to fall
There's a chill in the air and the howl of a wolf while the rain beats at the door
Seven kings will ride on the wind up towards the mountains high
And the only sound that will break the air is the warrior's bitter cry

When the dawn of a new day will see the light then the strongest hearts grow old
And the warrior stands on top of the hill in the snow

Dark night with a glimmering light in the distance up ahead
In the forest they dwell with a misty spell no one heard what once was said
And the eagle fly through the clouds while earth bleeds dark and cold
When the voices of men will ring out again all creation shall unfold

When the colour of night will fade to light and the weakest hearts go cold
And the warrior stands on top of the hill in the snow

And we're standing one and all fighting till we fall
Hoping for a better day never giving in
Until we find the words till we find the words to say
Until we find the words to say

Burning starfire shine in the sky
For the lives of great men who stand by your side
When the night fall on we will ride
For no lost souls will live on forever

Dark night on the valley below still the horsemen follow through
It's a forest that leads to the foot of the hill that inside the magic holds
Seven strong they ride on along to the place where sorrow lies
And the shadows of the night will no longer hide all their mysteries come undone

When the colour of night will fade to light and the weakest hearts go cold
And the warrior stands on top of the hill in the snow

And we're standing one and all fighting till we fall
Hoping for a better day never giving in
Until we find the words till we find the words to say
Until we find the words to say

Burning starfire shine in the sky
For the lives of great men who stand by your side
When the night fall on we will ride
For no lost souls will live on forever

And we're standing one and all fighting till we fall
Hoping for a better day never giving in
Until we find the words till we find the words to say
Until we find the words to say

Burning starfire shine in the sky
For the lives of great men who stand by your side
When the night fall on we will ride
For no lost souls will live on forever

For lost souls will live on forever...

6. Disciples Of Babylon
Can you imagine that it's all up to you
Evil embrace of powers unnatural
You're left in silence nothing more to behold
You close your eyes and visualize the day you'll get away

It's here
It's near
I see it all so clear
Tonight your flight will take you higher

It's here
It's near
You live a life of fear
Tonight is the night that will inspire

Crying alone at night your destiny unknown
You're every being full of rage and hate
Seems like you're running but you just can not hide
It's in a raging fear all solitude is left behind

It's here
It's near
I see it all so clear
Tonight your flight will take you higher

It's here
It's near
You live a life of fear
Tonight is the night that will inspire

Can he comfort thee and fill your life with ecstasy
Through the darkness and the pain
Will you be the ones again
Disciples of Babylon

It's here
It's near
I see it all so clear
Tonight your flight will take you higher

It's here
It's near
You live a life of fear
Tonight is the night that will inspire

Can he comfort thee and fill your life with ecstasy
Through the darkness and the pain
Will you be the ones again
Disciples of Babylon

It's here
It's near
I see it all so clear
Tonight your flight will take you higher

It's here
It's near
You live a life of fear
Tonight is the night that will inspire

Can he comfort thee and fill your life with ecstasy
Through the darkness and the pain
Will you be the ones again
Disciples of Babylon

7. Revelations
Coming down the mountain on high
Towards the battle we go side by side
Our hearts are filled with honour and pride
Cause we know our time has come

Silent voices down from below
Rising up through the ice and the snow
Ancient angers cast upon all
Through the land of the slain

Through the dark night through the rain
Fighting machine we are risen again
Striving forever more
We will survive

Stand and fight join the light
Into the battle with power and might
Sound the guns
Raise the cannons of war

With the north star to guide us we ride on the sky
Blazing up through the heavens like eagles we fly
And the horsemen shall come they will judge all your lives
Revelations will now be unveiled

Darkened night set to swallow the light
All is lost there's no one left to fight
Overpowered by the glory and might
Of the ones who stand tall

Fallen heroes scattered around
Deafened ears opens up to the sound
Painful cries rising forever more
Through the victims of life and of war

Through the dark night through the rain
Fighting machine we are risen again
Striving forever more
We will survive

Stand and fight join the light
Into the battle with power and might
Sound the guns
Raise the cannons of war

With the north star to guide us we ride on the sky
Blazing up through the heavens like eagles we fly
And the horsemen shall come they will judge all your lives
Revelations will now be unveiled

No more hope of freedom
Our dreams are washed away
The second age is coming
It's the dawn of a new day

Judgement stands before us
The second king will rise
Our swords will shine with honour
Hatred fills the sky

Hatred fills the sky...

With the north star to guide us we ride on the sky
Blazing up through the heavens like eagles we fly
And the horsemen shall come they will judge all your lives
Revelations will now be

With the north star to guide us we ride on the sky
Blazing up through the heavens like eagles we fly
And the horsemen shall come they will judge all your lives
Revelations will now

Revelations will now
Revelations will now be unveiled

8. Evening Star
[Music: Herman Li, lyrics: Herman Li, ZP Theart]

We will sail on
Forever on
To the land of the evening star

Into the endless we ride
Unveil the darkness behind
Abandoned glory hidden
Castaway we ride

Now will the sky surrender
Forever through the never
A silent whisper echoes
Through my restless heart tonight

I will see glory rise
We'll be one tonight

Don't you shut your eyes in silence
Tonight gather near
Come and live your fear

In a land of desire
Your heart filled with fire
You live for the right to be free
We will sail on
Forever on
To the land of the evening star

In a land of desire
Your heart filled with fire
The land of the evening star

Now and forever after
Asylums filled with laughter
Suspicion haunts my dreams
An echo through my mind

This starlit gaze reminds me
Are you so blind you can't see?
The winds of change, my friend,
Will blow for you in the dead of nights

I will see glory rise
We'll be one tonight

Don't you shut your eyes in silence
Tonight gather near
Come and live your fear

In a land of desire
Your heart filled with fire
You live for the right to be free
We will sail on,
Forever on
To the land of the evening star

In a land of desire
Your heart filled with fire
The land of the evening star

[Solos: Herman, Sam, Herman and Vadim, Herman, Vadim and Sam, Herman]

In a land of desire
Your heart filled with fire
The land of the evening star

We are flying on wings in winter sky with fire burning deep inside
We are warriors of endless time forever and on
On wings of steel an ancient flight we see the powers that unite
The gods will now send us a sign of battle once more

10. Where Dragons Rule
[Bonus Track]

Full the moon and midnight sky
Through the dark they ride
Warriors of forever will sacrifice the night

One for all and all for one
The future time has come
Faces filled with torment
Your heart beats like a drum

Never you will surrender
You'll fight on 'til the end
Together we will be strong again
Forever...

In this land we have defended from all things dark and cruel
Now we are defenseless in a land where dragons rule

In this land we have defended from all things dark and cruel
Now we are defenseless in a land where dragons rule

Flash of steel in the mid-day sun
The battle has begun
Blood spills all around us but still we carry on

No mercy we will show to them
The white flag shall be raised
We'll fight for our freedom
Ride towards this evil place

We all stand until the end allegiance to this game

In this land we've defended from all things dark and cruel
Now we're defenseless in a land where dragons rule

In this land we've defended from all things dark and cruel
Now we're defenseless in a land where dragons rule

Sun set in the western sky
The battle's almost done
The victory will be glorious
Our enemies are gone

We all stand until the end allegiance to this game

In this land we've defended from all things dark and cruel
Now we're defenseless in a land where dragons rule

In this land we've defended from all things dark and cruel
Now we're defenseless in a land where dragons rule

[Solo]

In this land we've defended from all things dark and cruel
Now we're defenseless in a land where dragons rule [3x]

1. Heroes Of Our Time
Lost in a dream, finally it seems,
Emptiness and everlasting madness,
See the sadness grow, watching as we know,
Long before our journey for the world,
Call for us, the power in all of us,
So far beyond the blackened sky tonight...
Glorious, forever more in us,
We are victorious, and so alive.

[Chorus]
We'll all find our sacrifice tomorrow,
Our journey on towards a brighter day,
Silent tears we left behind, still so far away,
Across the endless sands,
Through the fields of our despair,
Free for all eternity, we stand, yeah,
Rise above the universe tonight,
Starchaser...

Fly towards the storm, see the world reborn,
Feel the pain inside the voice of sorrow,
Cross the distant shores, find the open door,
Stand alone, in judgment for tomorrow.

Years of pain still haunt us all, we saw the last sunrise,
Take me home, in freedom, for a lifetime...
Pray now for the silence, and the last tears we'll cry
So glorious, this fire inside, united we stand.

[Chorus]
And we'll all find our sacrifice tomorrow,
Our journey on towards a brighter day,
Silent tears we left behind, still so far away,
Across the endless sands,
Through the fields of our despair,
Free for all eternity, we stand, yeah,
Rise above the universe tonight,
Starchaser...

Free from this world, here for the last time,
Oceans collide inside of us all,
Believe who we are,
The phoenix will guide us,
Freedom will rise once again.

Save us tonight, the last hope for all of us,
Light-years gone by, we're still holding on,
Save us tonight, a star shines in all of us,
Far beyond our lives, still our glory lives on.

[Chorus]
And we'll all find our sacrifice tomorrow,
Our journey on towards a brighter day,
Silent tears we left behind, still so far away,
Across the endless sands,
Through the fields of our despair,
Free for all eternity, we stand, yeah,
Rise above the universe tonight,
Starchaser...Starchaser...

Our kingdom come, we stand as one,
And we will live for always evermore...

2. The Fire Still Burns
Finally all the world will see,
Rise again before the endless silence,
Burn the soul before we'll all be free,
Light the path beneath a blackened, burning sky.

One final sacrifice, this night belongs to me,
Turn back before the dawn of winter,
So far away the cry set fallen angels free,
Through my mind tonight, our journey ever after.

Never ending solitude, this is your life to be,
So cold and dark, the voice of sadness,
Suffering in endless pain, the truth of all to be,
Crawling back to life through ever-blinding darkness.

Free falling, fates warning, find a life to hold on,
Souls stealers, true believers, rise now they are gone,
And as they ride away forsake the one to save us,
Winters mourning of a lost fallen world,
Pray now united in a lifetime alone,
Won't you wait for the silence so strong?
Wait for the dawn.

[Chorus:]
Tonight, falling like the rain insanity lives on,
Feel the shattered dreams, one thousand voices crying,
Raging endlessly they come, whoa,
And the morning light will hide the darker days gone by,
And the sun will shine again across the blazing skies,
Glorious eternally we'll rise above the world,
Marching on till victory we fight,
The fire still burns...

Looking back our passing lives, their memories to see,
Flick through the passages of silence,
Hidden by the sacrifice to set the demons free,
Now they understand reclaim the land relentless.

Fear calling, transforming, stand alone in our time,
Advocation, desolation, slay the vision divine,
And all the stars fall around the world tonight,
Silent forces from a past life return,
Pray for the silence in a world so alone,
Til' we touch the horizon beyond,
Fly through the storm.

[Chorus]

The tears in your eyes,
A lifetime of misery,
In silence we stand all alone for the fate of our own destiny,
A lifetime of lies,
One chance at this fantasy,
The judgement will pass for the cries of the world that has faded from me.

Whoa, oh oh oh,
Whoa, oh oh oh,
Whoa, oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh ohhh,
Whoa, oh oh oh,
Whoa, oh oh oh,
Whoa, oh oh oh oh oh ohhhh oh oh oh.

[Chorus]

3. Reasons To Live
Once again I'm here alone, my secret life awaits me,
Still a thousand miles away from a land of broken dreams,
Night falls and the screen is shining, force deception behind the lines,
Hours wasted aimlessly gone, time and time again.

[Pre-chorus:]
Try to understand, desperately lost with a dream in my hand,
Will you wait alone for me tonight?
Hold me, save me.

[Chorus:]
A star shines in all of us, we'll search for all our lives,
One day we'll find a way, and a reason to survive,
Cry for the day to return, life no one can understand,
We all face our fears in the world,
We all hold our place in the universe,
For eternity...

Hide the lines deceive myself, erase the past from my space,
Images of loneliness sent far across the land,
Once sure, but my eyes are blinded,
Frantic charge for a place to hide
Lost generations apart, an ancient life returns.

Kindness in her eyes, taken away by a man in disguise,
Won't you wait alone again tonight?
Save me, take me.

[Chorus]

[Pre-chorus]

A star shines in all of us, we'll search for all our lives,
One day we'll find a way, and a reason to survive,
Cry for the day to return, life no one can understand,

Our past lives return to us all.
Our memories will fly free forever.
So far from the cries of the world for eternity.

4. Heartbreak Armageddon
Highway of emptiness outside the burning world,
Rise again this quest for our salvation,
Running faster, the savage laughter, the daylight fades away,
Nothing left but the life we left behind,
Ever searching the hidden faces, the hatred grows inside,
Broken man and a family left destroyed.

Light years away, empty words between us,
So turn away and say goodbye for the last time tonight,
Still lost within the loneliness a lifetime ago,
Hanging on as we passed through the fields,
These pieces of our lives will lead the long journey home,
And the wounds never heal

[Chorus:]
So fly for the last time, and the fire burns within,
Silently we stand in a long forgotten wasteland,
Rise through the lost ages, hope they will bring,
Free forever more and the dream will never die.

Devastation, a lost connection, a beatdown man returns,
So confused and alone for one more time,
Crushed defeated, the fog surrounding, a prisoner trapped inside,
System down feel the veins erupt tonight.

Time after time, promises of freedom,
We'll leave the past behind and strike for the first time tonight,
Still mystified by lack of cravation they show,
After all of the trials we've been through,
These memories and empty words were all lost in vain,
And the scars never heal.

[Chorus 3x]

Whoa, oh, oh,
And the dream will never die.

5. The Last Journey Home
Strangers to reason, our bleeding hearts so cold,
Life brings a change in season, fear will blind the soul,
In the silence one moment alone,
Cast away scattered far on the wasteland.

Sever the soul from the forgotten sickness, escape this life,
Challenge the dream before the long departed a mindless rhyme,
Whoa, oh, oh,
Hear the burning thunder roar,
Whoa, oh, oh, oh, oh, ohhh.

Whoa, oh, oh,
Still lost in a fire storm,
Tonight we feel the past return.

Lost inside the dream, pass by the life we'll live forever,
Still the wasted time left burning below
One thousand shattered voices, lost inside in endless wonder,
Tonight her voice will take me home.

[Chorus:]
Shine glorious we run, we stare into the blackened sky,
Save the last command, the virtue blinding,
So far beyond the sun, still burning with the fire inside,
Once alone again, silent stares for our last journey home.

Paralysed, intensified mutation, frustration,
Everlasting lifetime in the underworld,
We'll travel endlessly, deluded, disjointed,
One man can't understand this sad misery.

Whoa, oh oh oh ohh,
Whoa, oh oh ohh,
Whoa, oh oh oh oh oh ohh.

They've taken my heart,
They've taken my soul,
And now we stand alone insanity.

In time we'll see the past unwind,
Alive, still wandering our fallen land,
One more time we stare into the blackened sky,
For tonight, in our hearts now we feel,
One last time see our destiny revealed.

[Chorus]

Shine glorious tonight, still blinded by the blackened sun,
Save the last command, forever rising,
So far beyond they come, still burning with the fire inside,
Once alone again, silent stares for our last journey home.

6. A Flame For Freedom
[Chorus:]
One dream in all of us still shining,
One star, the ever-lasting light,
So alone, so lost inside, to the end in paradise,
United, victorious, the hearts of our nation tonight.

In the dark December morning light,
Fall strong to the burning winds, the fires of Hell will forsake me,
Shattering the chains that ever bind us,
Suffering their pain eternally.

Four strong, smash the silence, carry on like before,
Fires burn, still we battle, lost so far away,
Storm with hell fire raging, sun shines down as they kneel,
Lost in times and long forgotten, gathering miles away.

Tears fall inside the dream, our last days gone by,
Still alive we feel the pain tonight,
Stars fall through blackened clouds, in dreams sadness reigns,
A twilight star in the thousand lights for me.

Ohhhhhhhhh.

[Chorus]

And still we save a breath for the world,
Life brings up for us all,
United, victorious, the hearts of our nation tonight.

One dream in all of us still shining,
One star, the ever lasting light...

[Chorus]

And still we save a breath for the world,
Life brings up for us all,
United, victorious, the hearts of our nation tonight.

United, victorious, the hearts of our nation tonight.

7. Inside The Winter Storm
Strangers they come with the rise of the sun,
To escape from this madness forever,
Rivers will dry, bringing holes in the sky,
As the empire is fading away.

Silently march now, where the lost souls run wild,
In a time long forgotten, forever,
Pain brings us sadness at the dawn of the world,
But this nightmare will still carry on.

Through the day we'll find a way, we're lost beneath the stars,
Faceless they fall now, and we all stand as one,
Long wasted tears, but a light forever shining,
One stand one last demand to end it all.

[Pre chorus:]
Outside the world in a fallen land, turn away from our despair,
We stand alone in a silent dream, lost within eternally,
Whoa, oh oh ohh,
Whoa, oh oh oh ohh,
Rise again and try to understand.

[Chorus:]
A light for the world will save us tonight,
Redemption still so far away,
Marching on inside of our loneliness,
Still searching for all that remains.

And time will pass me by,
But I'm not so far away,
We're the sons of the land, our lifeblood runs into the ocean,
Tomorrow we're gone, our souls rising up to the sun.

[Chorus]

It's just one wasted man in one wasted land,
Suffering, still burning, so alive,
It's just one wasted man, in one wasted land,
Until the end of time,
Inside the winter storm.

[Pre chorus]

[Chorus]

It's just one wasted man, in one wasted land,
Suffering so far, and so alive,
It's just one wasted man, in one wasted land,
Until the end of time,
Inside the winter storm.

Inside the winter storm !

8. The Warrior Inside
Sonic fires bring mass devastation,
Manic search in sad desperation,
Jeopardise the right to hide from a sad existence,
Nothing left, still searching for something,
Deep beneath the cries
Wait for the deafening silence, fly forever more.

Crushed by the thought that you're all alone, cravation in her eyes,
I will be waiting tomorrow,
Striving to understand, wasting a life not meant to be,
Twisted and so broken once again,
And the promises we cast away will shine a guiding light,
Victim of your grief and denial.

[Chorus:]
Take my hand, this one last time,
Face the world before us, the warrior inside,
In a lifetime of disaster, it's a battle to the end,
Final stand, my life must carry on,
And forever, this time.

Battered, beaten, forced to submission,
Stricken by your fatal decision,
Suddenly it's time to say your last goodbyes,
Misery remains voluntary, all illusion gone,
Break through the blistering madness,
Free forever more.

Blinded my eyes with your filtering mutation cast aside,
I'll still be waiting tomorrow,
Stand to a toxic man, forced to a life of yesterday,
Theatre of salvation crushed and burned,
Down this lonely road, recede the day our dreams are brushed,
Can't regain this emptiness in time.

[Chorus]

See through the skies,
Far beyond the road tonight,
Here the sounds of freedom ring,
In a silent dream, and a million miles away.

See through the skies, far beyond our world tonight,
Hear the sounds of freedom ring,
In a silent dream,
And a million miles away.

Reach for the stars,
And live our lives forever free,
In our hearts for a thousand years,
And a thousand lifetimes before.

And the dawn of a new day will rise, a light for us all.

9. Strike Of The Ninja
[Special Edition Bonus Track]Eternal temptation, their eyes to the sky
This nightmare is everywhere, my eyes open wide
Crash on through troubled waters, oceans collide
We stand alone until the end, we fight side by side

Standing strong together, marching forever on
Fire in the heavens, now that our time has come

We feel the fire burning bright in the night
Where the warrior lives and the warrior dies
Wherever you go, we will be by your side
For the Spirit of Ninja will carry the night

The sky will turn black as nightfall appears
The hatred surrounding, they hide in great fear
The evil all around, the sound they will hear
Will not be for long now, the time it is near

Raising hell forever, still millenniums go by
Fire in the heavens, bleeding ears hear the cry

We feel the fire burning bright in the night
Where the warrior lives and the warrior dies
Wherever you go, we will be by your side
For the Spirit of Ninja will carry the night

Standing strong together, marching forever on
Fire in the heavens, now that our time has come

We feel the fire burning bright in the night
Where the warrior lives and the warrior dies
Wherever you go, we will be by your side
For the Spirit of Ninja tonight

We feel the fire burning bright in the night
Where the warrior lives and the warrior dies
Wherever you go, we will be by your side
For the Spirit of Ninja will carry the night

With the ninja forever, tonight!

10. Scars Of Yesterday
[Special Edition Bonus Track]Suffer the raging anger creeping below
Trapped in the circle, so helpless
Forces beyond
This is your last chance to die

I hear a thousand voices screaming my name
Dreams of a life forgotten now will be gone
Never to return again

Hide from the light, you feel so hypnotized
Filtered and disguised
Burning forever, try to remember
Sadness in her eyes

So many times now we've been here before
No more illusions behind the open door
Trapped within my fierce desire, resistance is futile
Screaming for your life, nowhere to hide
Tonight we cross the line, your innocence is mine

Falling down, my life fading now to the end
One last chance of glory in my heart again
Set me free from craving the one thing I can't have inside of me
But is it all a waste of time?

Lost in a misery, the fatal demise
Forced to a living that no one can understand
Hiding behind all the lies

A long time in slavery, it cries out in vain
Lurking around the shadows until the end
Fearless in fatal disguise

Wake from the dream, the life you left behind
Time to understand
Lost in the laughter, life everafter
Trials of a broken man

And through this madness a new day will rise
We shall remember the pain she held inside
Fear the pain inside my heart, our sacrifice in vain
Screaming for your life, nowhere to hide
This everlasting strain, driving you insane

Falling down, my life fading now to the end
One last chance of glory in my heart again
Set me free from craving the one thing I can't have inside of me
But is it all a waste of time?

Still lost in the universe, we cry for a new day to come
Break free from our loneliness, the last time
Pray tonight as we try to understand

Falling down, my life fading now to the end
I'm alive forever, my soul will ascend
One last chance of glory in my heart again
Set me free from this craving the one thing I can't have inside of me
Just a memory
Or is it all a waste of time?

11. E. P. M. (Extreme Power Metal)
[Japanese Bonus Track]In a lifetime of decay
Sudden cry for yesterday,
When the world will see the end of eternity
Sacrifice before the dawn
Of a child soon to be born
Before the night too many tears we cried

In a long forgotten land
Through the silent raging pain
Of the price to pay that awaits for me
The end of all our destiny

Don't close your eyes tonight
For the lights beyond still shine towards a brighter day
The time has come for us tread blood across the sands
Carry on as the red rivers run

And through the wilderness we feel the pouring rain
In the silence ever searching on through the misery
And all the promises we made and cried in vain
Don't you take the time to realise the master of disguise?

Blind my eyes burning forever to wash my sins away
Out of the dark pain is the price
Fly away out of the raging storm
Lost within my memories
Still haunting me
A never ending story

Far and wide forever on
Stand before the world alone we journey to the other side
Raise your hands to the sky
Through the night and through the day
Don't look back no time to pray
The battle rages on marching on and on

Don't cry for me tonight
For the lights beyond will guide me home tomorrow
The time will come for us the curse is growing strong
Carry on with the rise of the sun

So take me far away it's time to set me free
All my life I have been waiting but I could never see
Raising your hands to the sky
Turning your eyes to the sun
Pray for forgiveness
The power to save has gone for the last time

Blind my eyes burning forever to wash my sins away
Out of the dark pain is the price
Fly away out of the raging storm
Lost within my memories
Still haunting me
A never ending story

Blind my eyes burning forever to wash my sins away
Out of the dark pain is the price
Fly away out of the raging storm
Lost within my memories
Still haunting me
A never ending story

1. My Spirit Will Go On
[Music: Sam Totman, Lyrics: ZP Theart, Sam Totman]

Life is a misery, don't know how it's come to be
Death, the epitome of all of our days
In the past we had no choice to hear or to be the voice
Close your eyes and visualize the demon to arise

You know that sanity is not as it was meant to be
And now that misery has taken a new stand
In the land of a thousand souls we will carry on through the rain
In the sun we will move along with the memories of the slain
When I see this humanity and the evil that they have come to be
We've come to the point of no return and you beg for just...

One more time to escape from all this madness
One more time to be set free from all this sadness
And one last time to be the one who understands
My soul and my spirit will go on, for all of eternity

Foreign the currency, your payment in blood to be
Death is the destiny for all of our ways
In the dark you hide away for who or what you can't say
When I see the power of the demon come alive

You know that sanity is not as it was meant to be
And now that misery has taken a new stand
On the wings of eagles flying staring on to the sun
Reaching for the gold horizon when the war shall be won
Can you see the debauchery and the blade of death that has come for thee
In winds of torment forever more you will cry for just...

One more time to escape from all this madness...

[Solos - Sam / Herman / Sam / Herman / Twin Blast / Sam / Twin Blast / Sam]

2. Fury Of The Storm
[Music / Lyrics: Sam Totman]

We are riding for the battle field in force tonight
Fury of the darkest evil cry for war
Far beyond the boundaries of hell and starlight
On the road to lands unknown forever more

Through the caverns far below our quest will lead us
Onwards through the ice and snow forever more
Standing fighting full of hate the time has come now
Stand and sound the guns of glory cry for war

On wings of glory we will carry on
Far across the forgotten lands toward the distant sun
And in the darkness shining far beyond the starlight
Lightning is striking from the dark dawning shadows
And in the kingdom of the everlasting sun
When the glory of the master's time has come

Into the fires of forever we will fly through the heavens
With the power of the universe we stand strong together
Through the force of power, it will soon reach the hour
For victory we ride, Fury of the Storm!

We are the chosen ones we cannot fail now
Spilling all the blood on the fires below
Smashing through the boundaries with the fire and fury
Killing all the mortals down the winding road

Hell fires are raging the storm growing strong
On the path to victory towards the distant sun
And in the darkness shining far beyond the starlight
Lightning is striking from the dark dawning shadows
And in the kingdom of the everlasting sun
When the glory of the master's time has come

Into the fires of forever we will fly through the heavens
With the power of the universe we stand strong together
Trough the forced of power, it will soon reach the hour
For victory we ride, Fury of the Storm!

3. Fields Of Despair
[Music: Herman Li, Sam Totman, Lyrics: Herman Li, Sam Totman]

Can you feel the pain inside sometimes in my mind?
In the land of loneliness the seas of blood run cold
Is the feeling lost inside within the sins of all mankind?
Time after time we stood united on we go

Fly far away don't let the world pass you by
Live for the day when we must stand and survive
Now we face the judgment day our souls will feel the pain
Hear the screams of my world through the rain

Silent fields of despair my tears in the rain
Pain in my heart bleeding through
One day we'll be back for one moment in time
Endlessly searching for you...

Who can cure my emptiness inside for this time?
Suffering from loneliness my dreams and hopes will die
No more feelings left inside my blackened heart I cannot hide
Time after time our souls divided on we cry

Fly far away don't leave your own past behind
Live for the day another year passes by
Now we turn to face our fear there's nothing more to say
Still your dreams and my nightmares remain

Silent fields of despair my tears in the rain...

[Solos - Vadim / Sam / Vadim / Sam & Herman / Herman]

4. Dawn Over A New World
[Music / Lyrics: Sam Totman]

In the darkness of the night in the shadows of the dawn
It's turning black no looking back the sands of time are sown
When the day will slowly end and the sun has turned to grey
Will we feel the power of freedom with the dawn of a new day?

Over mountains paved with gold and through the valleys of the slain
Our quest will lead us onwards to the journey of the brave
When the time has come to stand for the power we believe
We will ring the sound of victory for one and all to see

Sometimes in your darkest dreams you will feel the haunting pain
Silent tears of your hidden fears come to haunt you once again
Fight on for the memories of the everlasting dream
Their in the silent lands on wings of glory free
We can go on forever with the darkness so far away
And the warriors who live forever fight on to the end

Across the highest mountains and through the endless seas
Our journey ever onwards fight until we all be free
Through the darkness shining the never ending light
On through the days of glory rise towards the fight

And one day we will find a way toward this distant golden age
The cries of war will sound the day
We stand before the dawn of a new world

On through the raging thunder across the seven seas
Cold winter skies are falling on the battles we have seen

[Solos - Herman / Sam]

We can go on forever with the darkness so far away
And the warriors who live forever fight on to the end

Across the highest mountains and through the endless seas...

5. Above The Winter Moonlight
[Music: Vadim Pruzhanov, Lyrics: Vadim Pruzhanov, Sam Totman, Herman Li, ZP Theart]

On wings of burning fire across the oceans far
The legends of the seven seas and mystic fallen star
Their laden ships are sailing on towards the sun
To the island of the everlasting chosen one

Face our fear along the way our freedom will prevail
The crown and the shining light
Punishment and anger in the fire of your soul
Prepare the eternal fight

Lost in a dream in a boundless sea
Rivers of pain are guiding me
Defending this land from the sins of man
Never surrender our dreams again

Ride forever onwards stare into the sun
Where hopes and dreams are everlasting marching on and on
Rise another day across the distant skies
Where the dawn above the winter moonlight shines upon the fall of our lives

Insanity sublime shall make by bleeding heart
Feel cold and fearless anger rising far beyond the dark
In search of might and wisdom sacrifice our souls
In the name of truth and justice never to be told

Face our fear along the way our freedom will prevail
The crown and the shining light
Punishment and anger in the fire of your soul
Prepare the eternal fight
Can you not feel the eternal pain
Flows through your heart and every vein
The torture begins and it breaks you down
Nothing to save when the soul is gone

Ride forever onwards stare into the sun...

[Solos - Herman / Sam / Herman / Sam]

6. Soldiers Of The Wasteland
[Music: Sam Totman, Lyrics: ZP Theart, Sam Totaman]

Burning fires, burning lives
On the long distant roads
Through the lost mountains endless
So far away from home

Crossing battles savage seas towards the mountains high
Forest plains of wilderness we're striking out tonight
On towards our destiny we travel far and wide
Journey through the darkness as your hearts refuse to die

In the flames of hell we fire at will the fires of doom has come
With the forces of the blackest knights they're staring at the sun
Far across the distant plains of ice we're searching for the sword
When the time has come for the battle now we follow with the horde

We will ride with fire burning hot towards the night sky
In the land of long ago forever in our souls
Fly on wings of shining steel are burning so bright
In ancient lands of warriors we're riding on again

Burning fires burning lives on the long distant roads
Through the lost mountains endless so far away from home
Warrior soldiers forever we fought long ago
We're all lost in the darkness so far away from home

Fallen soldiers taste the steel of death the daylight dawning
Sun will shine upon the lives of burning hearts of ice
As you break through the boundaries of life this feeling of despair
And they die in their sleep for the world that will not care
You feel lost in this labyrinth of pain this sickening dismay
There's a voice inside that's calling another wasted day

Can't you see the history the suffocating madness
In the land of fallen souls there's nowhere left no place to go
I have traveled far and wide across the wasteland
Still searching for the answers for the right to understand

Burning fires burning lives on the long distant roads...

Riding through the starlight and smashing the boundaries as hellfire falls from the sky
A shadow of pain will arise from the ashes of those fallen ones who have died
Our only master with fire and fury of hell will see his bidding done
Blasting from high as the battle unfolds to the gates of the city we come

[Solos - Twin Blast / Sam / Herman / Herman / Herman / Vadim / Sam / Herman / Sam / Vadim / Herman / Herman / Herman, Sam & Vadim]

7. Prepare For War
[Music: Herman Li, Lyrics: Herman Li, ZP Thearth]

I hear a distant thunder
They say bow down surrender
Witnessing our demise and the sins of our land
Why can't we see from under?
Dark reign of our defenders
Endlessly torturing the souls without stand

Fight now let's break the chains
So strong we must feel the pain
Forever torn apart from the haunting hears of my heart

Rage and fear from skies above the fire fuels my veins
Destruction of humanity the everlasting flame
Cast away no turning back from long forgotten shores
We'll show no mercy as they fall
The fire burns inside now prepare for war!

You fear the pain no longer
Daylight your heart be stronger
Don't even sense the burning hunger inside
Ride out with force and valor
In memory forever
Towards the battering and rise of the tide

Stand now and break the chains
In unity we feel no pain
Forever torn apart from the haunting fears of my heart

Rage and fear from skies above the fire fuels my veins...

[Solo - Herman, Solos - Sam / Herman]

Looking around there's no fear in your heart
For I know you will never surrender
Everyone here raise their eyes to the sky
Now with strength and honor we fight
PREPARE FOR WAR!

[Solos - Sam / Herman / Sam]

Rage and fear from skies above the fire fuels my veins...

8. Once In A Lifetime
[Music: Sam Totman, Lyrics: ZP Theart, Sam Totman]

Dark clouds and thunderstorms in the fires and flames were born
Through darkness traveling on the night
Hellfires and rain will fall, time is coming for us all
Our journey for the guiding light

Firelight it is burning so bright in the dark of the night
As we fight for the glory tonight there's nowhere to hide
On the wings of your destiny brings all the power you crave
Careful now if not you then who else will we save

Lost in this world total stranger
Death by the sword a common danger
You know that everything is not what it seems
March on all night forever searching
Daylight ahead is coming again
Break through the walls and use the power of your dreams

Once in a lifetime take a chance at the right time the glory to see
Rise up for the time of your life
Now the time has come for you to be free

In the minds of society we all live in harmony
Truth is that we all die in vain
You stand for what you believe
I kill for what I conceive
Is there then a title for this game?

Far away in the wastelands of hell full of torment and pain
Demon knights riding over the heights where the fallen are slain
Violent fury of firestorming death now no life will prevail
Now you live all your days in the fires of hell

Lost in this world total stranger
Death by the sword a common danger
You know that everything is not what it seems
March on all night forever searching
Daylight ahead coming again
Break through the walls and use the power of your dreams

Once in a lifetime take a chance at the right time the glory to see
Rise up for the time of your life
Now the time has come for you to be free

[Solos - Herman / Sam / Herman / Sam / Herman]

9. Cry Of The Brave
[Music: Vadim Pruzhanov, Lyrics: Vadim Pruzhanov, Herman Li, Sam Totman, ZP Theart]

Since the darkness took our minds
They burned our courage many died
Had to leave it all behind rebuild our lives
Passing memories remained
It made my soul a burning flame
Haunted dreams of my desire
Reveal my name

Raise our swords we fight for life
Shields and armor shining bright
Strike like dragons we have no fear
Our swords are made of steel

[Chorus:]
Fly across the high seas and mountains
Rise above the golden horizon
Far away beyond the gates of space and time
Through the wastelands forever and on
Still we fight on for our freedom
The cry of the fallen souls bleeding
Forever journey through the lands of ice and snow
Will we face all the fears of the world?
The cry of the brave

Since the time we saw the sign
Destruction of your feeble mind
Centuries have come and gone but nothing's changed
Hopes and dreams have disappeared
Destruction of your kind is near
Trapped inside your suffering eternal flame

Search the darkness search the light
Fierce resistance what a fight
Glory for unholy seal
Lies all cast in steel

[Chorus]

[Solos - Herman / Sam / Herman / Sam]

In the depths of your desire
So secretly you feed the fire
Burning through the memories of all our lives
Watch the day turn into night
You reach out for that guiding light
First to be the one to hear their blinding lies

Fear of darkness fear of light
Sucked in by their ancient might
Ruthless in what you may feel
When your mind they steal

[Chorus]

1. Holding On
Steel of our brave hearts trapped inside
In frozen illusion
High is the mountain we must climb
Reach out for rebellion

Rise up to the open sky
One chance at the price of glory
Fire in a thousand blazing skies
One lifetime ascending
Strong as an army side by side
Still brave and defending

March on through the tragic lands
Cold tears in the north wind falling
Raise your souls high
See the new dawn arise through the

[CHORUS]
Sands of all time, mystery of life
Everlasting sadness through light years gone by
land lost in time, once more back where we belong
Promises of yesterday, we'll keep holding on

Silent and twisted lifeless mind
So blind in delusion
Cursed by the emptiness inside
Cast out in confusion

Strike back with the power in hand
Break free from a past life dying
Onwards we strive till
The answers we'll find in the

[CHORUS]

Still lost alone and I'm dying
Daylight the world is still crying
Evermore we'll search throughout a lifetime

[SOLOS: HERMAN / SAM]

Stars are falling down tonight,
light the path where eagles fly
Find the strength inside us, a new world reborn
Silent tears of pain we cried,
raise our hands unto the sky
Break the chains that bind us,
One movement in time as we

Rise up to the open sky
One chance at the price of glory
Raise your souls high
See the new dawn arise through the

Sands of all time, mystery of life
Everlasting sadness through light years gone by
land lost in time, once more back where we belong
Memories of life to pray for
Everlasting price to pay for
Promises of yesterday, we'll keep holding on

Woah, Woah, Woah, Woah

Sands of all time, once more we'll rise up again
Stand alone and fight till the end

[SOLO: HERMAN]

2. Fallen World
Soldiers of fire
Rage of the universe
Cold steel and bloodshed
In the lost barren wasteland

Fear rising higher,
Rage of the winter war
Death calls at night fall,
Our hatred still burns as

We march through endless skies
Mankind will fall, death will arise

[Chorus:]
For a lifetime we fight without reason,
Still we wait for the warriors return
Though we're cast out and broken, we still carry on
Alone in a lost fallen world
Woah-Yeah!

Flames burning higher,
Curse of the winter land,
Black, torn, and twisted
In the fast-fading twilight

Storm winds still blowing
Steel shapes our destiny,
Death calls at night fall
Our curse with be lifted

Disguise this timeless crime
Brave men will fall, evil will rise!

[Chorus]

Still heroes we're born with promises so blind
The light at the end of the road that we all must climb (climb)

[SOLOS: HERMAN / SAM + VADIM / SAM / HERMAN]

For a lifetime we fight without reason
Still we wait for the warriors return
Though we're cast out and broken we still carry on
Alone in a lost fallen world
Alone in a lost fallen world

Woah-Yeah!

3. Cry Thunder
Time after time as we march side by side
Through the valleys of evil and the torturing souls,
Night after night, for the glory we fight,
In the kingdom of madness and the tales from the old

Death by our hands, for the higher command,
As the darkness surrounds us hear the cries as they fall
Fire burning steel and the tyrants will kneel
Hearts burning stronger with the power of the sword

Set sail for the glory,
Pray for the master of war (pray for the master of war)
Sunlight will fall by the wastelands,
Endless rise for the heroes before

Cry thunder!
Sword in his hand,
Titans of justice, fearless we stand
Cry thunder!
Strong in command
Blessed by the union, freedom of man

Reckoning day, for the demons we slay,
With the force of a dragon we will conquer them all!
Chaos still reigns devastation and flames
For the ultimate glory when the legacy calls

March on
Through the hellfire
Blazing for the darkness beyond (blazing for the darkness beyond)
Nightmare return of the thousands
Screaming rise to the heroes once more

Cry thunder!
Sword in his hand,
Titans of justice, fearless we stand
Cry thunder!
Strong in command
Blessed by the union, freedom of man

[Solos]

Unholy darkness,
In the eyes of broken dreams,
Outside of the wasted and torn,
A land of tears still remains
Soldiers of destiny calling,
And the fallen will rise up again,
Conquer the forces of evil and fight to the end

Cry thunder!
Sword in his hand,
Titans of justice, fearless we stand
Cry thunder!
Strong in command,
Saviour of nations, freedom of man

Cry thunder!
Sword in his hand,
Warriors defending,
One final stand
Cry thunder!
Strong in command,
Blessed by the union, freedom of man

Blessed by the union of man
Cry thunder!
Yeah yeah

4. Give Me The Night
[SOLO: HERMAN]

Falling gradually, endlessly the perfect disease
Everyone's a winner but you're down on your knees
Sanity is passing one more shot if you please
For the one final game I won't be playing

Still the same tempting voice in my mind
Losing grip on it all (losing grip on it all)
Carry on through the endless lies
'Cause I can't see a reason why

[CHORUS]
Give me the night
Let me be me for one last time
A prisoner of myself lost in disguise
Just give me the night
Still living in a twisted dream
There's no tomorrow for right now will be
The best time of my life

Hammering, sickening, torment and pain
Blind ambition to poison my brain
Cheating, lying, begging, stealing day after day
For the one final dose I won't be saving

Pure darkness consuming my life
Don't wanna die here alone (die here alone)
Walk away from reality
Got a date with the enemy

[CHORUS]

The best time of my life!

[SOLOS: FRED / HERMAN / SAM]

Still the same tempting voice in my mind
Losing grip on it all (losing grip on it all)
Carry on through the endless lies
'Cause I can't see a reason why

[CHORUS]

YEAH!

5. Wings Of Liberty
Outside of this world,
There's a life force still burning
Outside of this land
There's a star shining free

In silence we stand,
On a golden horizon, calling
This time there's a light for us
Still shining so bright for us
Again

Trapped inside this paradise still bleeding
While there are so many faces in this mask of lies
Blinded by the promises and the life in pain
Now the time has come for all of us to rise

Through the fires of hell between us
Through a lifetime of our dreams
Endless tears still burn inside
Beneath the sadness of our screams

And the years of our forsaken lands
Silent we stand here alone
Nothing to say when the evil finally burns

We all stand in silence for the wasted and gone
One warrior standing through a thousand year storm
Our past lives still shining, the starlight reveals
Our glory remembered for the power of the steel

And the winter rain will fall, around the brave and fallen
Like the sands of endless time, they'll never be forgotten
We all stand in silence for the wasted and gone,
For the last time we cry now for freedom

Cast aside, this dying world forsakes us
Break the chains of our creation now to save our lives
Blight of all eternity and the curse of steel
Like the winter rain will tear the blazing skies

From the wastelands of destruction
With the fire we hold inside
Rise again, still glorious
For the power of all mankind

Through the years of our forsaken lands
Silent we stand here alone
Nothing to say when the evil finally burns

We all stand in silence for the wasted and gone
One warrior standing, through a thousand years strong
Our past lives still shining, the starlight reveals
Our glory remembered, with the power of the steel

And the winter rain will fall, around the brave and fallen
Like the sands of endless time, they'll never be forgotten
We all stand in silence for the wasted and gone,
For the last time we cry now for freedom

[SOLOS: VADIM / HERMAN / SAM / FRED]

Through the trials of fire behind us,
In the dark and burning skies
Fallen tears still lost inside
Within the memories of our lives

And the years of our forsaken lands
Silent we stand here alone
Nothing to say when the evil finally burns

We all stand in silence for the wasted and gone
One warrior standing, through a thousand years strong
Our past lives still shining, the starlight reveals
Our glory remembered, with the power of the steel

And the winter rain will fall, around the brave and fallen
Like the sands of endless time, they'll never be forgotten
We all stand in silence for the wasted and gone,
For the last time we cry now for freedom

For the last tiem we cry now for freedom... AGAIN!!!

6. Seasons
I'm searching through emptiness
And tried to forget us in vain
The light of the dark setting sun
Will bring my sadness to an end

Voices cry out through the fear and the doubt
As we wait for our lives to be better

[CHORUS]
The words are dying in the night
No winter lasts forever
The seasons pass and sunlight will shine on my life again
So let the past now burn down in flames

Locked in a prison, in a world of living fear
On the edge of my destruction marching on
Still suffer in darkness with the dreams of life not meant to be
As I lie awake and curse the rising sun

Sadness inside from the truth that she hides
And this pain in my heart for no reason

[CHORUS]

[SOLO: SAM]

Stare into my eyes, I'm burning with lust and desire
Won't you come down and let yourself go in the fire
So leave the past behind

[SOLO: HERMAN / FRED + VADIM]

The words are dying in the night
No winter lasts forever
The seasons pass and sunlight will shine on my life again
So leave the past behind

The dark clouds fading from my mind (fading from my mind)
No pain will last forever (last forever)
The seasons pass and sunlight will shine on my life again
So let the past now burn down in flames
Now burn down in flames

[SOLO: FRED]

7. Heart Of The Storm
Silently marching our quest for revenge
Lost in the forgotten tragedy
Scars of the past still alive in our veins
Onwards we fight to our destiny

Trample their forces we now overrun
Sign of the power inside of us
Cities in ruins and lives are destroyed
Stand at the edge of the universe

Suffering fills the open sky
Battering down the pain inside
Memories hide the moonlight sky till the end of our days

Conquering lands and fallen heroes
Sanity torn we ride on fearless
Victory sounds a thousand miles away

[CHORUS]
Into this world in wonder from a starlight sky
For a lifetime of freedom and the legend is born
Once more unbroken, the price we will pay
On this march into fire, the heart of the storm

Endless destruction consuming our land
Legions of darkness destroy mankind
Storming the wasteland we now overcome
Vanquising evil insane we find

Rise of the slain, breaking the chains
Fight through the whirlwind of doom

Live for the day, conquer the pain
Under the light of the moon

[CHORUS]

[SOLOS: SAM / HERMAN / SAM / HERMAN]

Outside the endless rain
Crushed by the burning pain
This life goes on forever after
Across the universe, on through the twilight sky
And still we feel the fire go on and on

[CHORUS]

8. Die By The Sword
Outside the battle ragin death upon us
No surrender unchained and free
Insanity will lead to blind destruction
Crush the evil, the foul disease

Our final destination reborn in darkness
Watching and waiting destroying with ease
The judgement day upon us as dawn is breaking
Mankind will fall to the spineless decieved

[CHORUS]
Fly through the storm, power of the steel
Striking with vegence, force them to kneel
Soldiers unite, force of the world
Fight till the end we will die by the sword

Fight on in foreign fields of mass destruction
Stand as one, no man left behind
Our final victory, tonight awaits us
Slain in darkness behind the lines

Raise the dead, ride beside of me
Fallen heroes, of a thousand moons
Blaze ahead the price that they now pay
On the march to their doom

[CHORUS]

Fight till the end we will die by the sword

Light the fires of freedom, on the shores of endless seas
Wings of glory guide us, on the path to victory
Light the fires of freedom, on the shores of endless seas
Wings of glory guide us, on the path to victory

[SOLOS: SAM / HERMAN]

Outside the battle raging death upon us
No surrender unchained and free
Insaniy will lead to blind destruction
Crush the evil, the foul disease

[CHORUS]

9. Last Man Stands
[SOLO: SAM]

One man remains
And the stars seem to change
Far beyond our universe tonight

And the cries of the brave
And the skies filled with pain
For the silent ones we pray for all tonight

New dawn rising destruction and pain
Long days passing the fear of the rain
Soldiers fighting on the price they will pay
Nuclear meltdown the world uncertain from the

Power of the tragedy of man's creation
Rise from the suffering for our salvation

Fearless we stand strong till the end, at the trial of all our lives
Now say our final goodbyes

[CHORUS]
Light the path for the journey home
Save a prayer for the lost alone
Find a way from the other side
Before the heroes task still binding
Through the long nights across the seas
Shine a light for eternity
Find a way beyond the other side
Until the last man stands for all mankind

[SOLO: HERMAN]

Skies now blackened the night turns to day
Nations fearful of global decay
Fires still raging on in vain now we pray
Nuclear fallout the fortunes fading as we

Stand at the edge barren desolation
Fight for the future of our generation

Fearless we stand, brave we defend
For a thousand years gone by
Now say our final goodbyes

[CHORUS]

[SOLOS: HERMAN / SAM / VADIM / SAM]

[CHORUS]

And the fate of the world in our hands
Rise again until the end of time
Until the last man stands for all mankind

11. Cry Thunder (Live Rehearsal)
[Bonus Track]Time after time, as we march side by side
Through the valleys of evil and the torturing souls
Night after night, for the glory we fight
In the kingdom of madness and the tales from the old

Death by our hands, for the higher command
As the darkness surrounds us in the quiet as they fall
Fire burning steel, and the tyrants will kneel
Hearts burning stronger with the power of the sword

Set sail for the glory
Pray for the master of war
Sunlight will fall by the wastelands
Endless rise to the heroes before

[Chorus:]
Cry thunder
Sword in his hand
Titans of justice, fearless we stand
Cry thunder
Strong in command
Blessed by the union, freedom of man

Reckoning day, for the demons we slay
With the force of a dragon we will conquer them all
Chaos still reigns, devastation and flames
With the ultimate glory when the legacy calls

March on through the hellfire
Blazing through the darkness beyond
Nightmares return of the thousands
Giving rise to the heroes once more

[Chorus]

[Solo]

Unholy darkness
In the eyes of broken dreams
Outside of the wasted and torn
a land of tears still remains
Soldiers of destiny calling
and the fallen will rise up again
Conquer the forces of evil and fight to the end

Cry thunder
Sword in his hand
Titans of justice, fearless we stand
Cry thunder
Strong in command
Savior of nations, freedom of man

Cry thunder
Sword in his hand
Warriors defending, one final stand
Cry thunder
Strong in command
Blessed by the union, freedom of man

Blessed by the union of man
Cry thunder

12. Heart Of The Storm (Alternative Chorus Version)
[Bonus Track]Silently marching, our quest for revenge
Lost in the forgotten tragedy
Scars of the past still alive in our veins
Onwards we fight to our destiny

Trample their forces we now overrun
Sign of the power inside of us
Cities in ruins and lives are destroyed
Stand at the edge of the universe

Suffering fills the open sky
Battering down the pain inside
Memories hide the moonlight sky
Till the end of our days

Conquering lands and fallen heroes
Sanity torn we ride on fearless
Victory sounds a thousand miles away

[Chorus:]
And still we stand alone before the moonlight rider
Rise again to light the power inside us
Fires of hell inside of the darkness burning
Far away from me
Ride again before the light, still shining
Fly towards, before the far horizon
Fires of hell inside of the darkness burning
Far away from me
In the dead of night

Endless destruction consuming our land
Legions of darkness destroy mankind
Storming the wasteland we now overcome
Vanquishing evil, insane we find

Rise of the slain, breaking the chains
Fight through the whirlwind of doom
Live for the day, conquer the pain
Under the light of the moon

[Chorus]

Outside the endless rain
Crushed by the burning pain
This life goes on forever after
Across the universe
On through the twilight sky
And still we feel the fire go on and on

1. Reaching Into Infinity
[Instrumental]
2. Ashes Of The Dawn
Trapped in this maze of existence entombed by misery, 
I was blinded by my fears
Lost in the dark through the shadows I heard you scream my name
Oh help me, please, out of this nightmare!

All my life I've been playing with fire,
set me free that's my only desire

The time has come for me, 
The time to overcome and do what is right for the world to see
And from the ashes of the dawn I arise 

The time has come for me, 
The time to overcome and do what is right for the world to see
And from the ashes of the dawn I arise 

Fear deep inside, is it madness that fueled my ecstasy
Now I'm drowning in my sorrows
Lord answer my prayers, lost in despair, is this the end?
Breaking the silence so real, we'll make it together

All my dreams have been torn to pieces
Hear the screams of my eternal pain

The time has come for me, 
The time to overcome and do what is right for the world to see
And from the ashes of the dawn I arise 

The time has come for me, 
The time to overcome and do what is right for the world to see
And from the ashes of the dawn I arise 

Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Solo: Sam/Herman]

I have seen the sorrow in your eyes
How I wish I'd made things better,
Find the strength to leave the past behind,
Just one more time, we'll live again

The time has come for me, 
The time to overcome and do what is right for the world to see
And from the ashes of the dawn I arise 

The time has come for me, 
The time to overcome and do what is right for the world to see
And from the ashes of the dawn I arise 

Forever!

3. Judgement Day
I feel the magic burning deep inside of me
No one can change the path of our true destiny

Don't be ashamed about the way we are
Another life awaits beyond the stars
We're calling
We're falling

A flood of passion now, I feel the urge in me
A generation shamed by all reality

But now this life's a raging battlefield
Though one day soon the truth will be revealed
The final judgment day

Riding on the wings of time
Feel the fire from the sky
Hold the power deep inside
Not afraid to die
We are the masters of the universe
On we ride towards the sign
Where the revelation hides
We're the guardians of the light
'Til the end of time
Until we see the last sunrise
And set the world on fire tonight

Forever walking, cold inside and all alone
A raging thunder far beyond our icy home

We close our eyes and feel the tears so cold
The ghosts of vengeance of the barren souls
Our one true judgment day

Riding on the wings of time
Feel the fire from the sky
Hold the power deep inside
Not afraid to die
We are the masters of the universe
On we ride towards the sign
Where the revelation hides
We're the guardians of the light
'Til the end of time
Until we see the last sunrise
And set the world on fire tonight

We reached for the moon
We conquered the stars
We cried for the tears of yesterday

Still strong to the end
'Til we'll meet again
Remember the glory of the brave

We stand at the dawn
Our kingdom reborn
And wait for the sun to rise again
A light in the sky
So free and so wild
A light from our last eternal flame

4. Astral Empire
Hear the cries of war
At the break of dawn
See the evil spread disease and fear to all

Through the centuries
Blood shall be the key
Now a leader of our destiny

As his army rose
Crushing endless foes
From the battle he will rain fires of hell from the sky

Bringer of the fire
For the great empire
Rising power of the fallen warriors' souls

Steel crushing steel, see the great fire descend from the sky
Never surrender, one day we'll be free
Flee from the swarm, through the forces of terror
No sacrifice 'til the end

Fly far away through the raging storm
'Til the end with the rise of the sun
On the winds rising higher through our astral empire
Break the chains, now this war shall be won

Hunting down their prey
From beyond the grave
Crush them into dust, a life of worthless slaves

Soon the world will see
Evil prophecy
Now we shall avenge a thousand warriors' souls

Now dark knowledge is mine
Voices inside
Witness the fall for the last time

Black is the power
Now is the hour to decide
Once more to

Fly far away through the raging storm
'Til the end with the rise of the sun
On the winds rising higher through our astral empire
Break the chains, now this war shall be won

Now dark knowledge is mine
Voices inside
Witness the fall for the last time

Black is the power
Now is the hour to decide
Once more to

Fly far away through the raging storm
'Til the end with the rise of the sun
On the winds rising higher through our astral empire
Break the chains, now this war shall be won

5. Curse Of Darkness
Here I stand, no one will ever ease my pain, blood is the answer
Until the end, I fight for my life and I never will surrender
Vengeance is mine, driven by sorrow and eternal hatred
Blood legacy, hear my endless cries

Shattered dreams, I am a shadow of the man I used to be
But I know tonight, your pain will be my delight
Hear the symphony from the score of the damned
Unleashing the eternal fire

Ride on your way, this is your curse of darkness
Ride through the night and one day you'll be free
Look to the sky where our hope's burning bright
Hear the laments of innocence rise

All alone, I am lost in the maze of this aeonian nightmare
Torn within, bound to suffer 'til I die
For centuries, just like the king of Ephira trapped for eternity
Haunted soul, I have the force to slay your kind

Ride on your way, this is your curse of darkness
Ride through the night and one day you'll be free
Look to the sky where our hope's burning bright
Hear the laments of innocence rise

As I look to the stars, I feel your presence in my heart
How I wish I could hear your voice again
Like my tears in the night, your memory still shining bright
On this lonely road I ride
Wandering... through the circles of Hell

Ride on your way, this is your curse of darkness
Ride through the night and one day you'll be free
Look to the sky where our hope's burning bright
Hear the laments of innocence rise

6. Silence
Silence, here in the sunset of my life
I've been walking through the darkness
With your ghost by my side
How I've tried, but can never stop the pain I feel
I have tried so hard but the wounds never heal

Now the time has come for our last goodbye
As I raise my head and gaze up to the skies
I have tried in vain but this is the end
We will meet again
I will be again

Mother, these are the final words I'll write
I know they're full of sadness, I know they'll make you cry
How I've tried to hide the truth of my despair
The sadness kept on calling, drowning out my prayers

There's no place for me, I'm torn apart
And I wish I could have made things better

Now the time has come for our last goodbye
As I raise my head and gaze up to the skies
I have tried in vain but this is the end
We will meet again
I will be again

There's no place for me, and deep inside
This pain won't last forever

Now the time has come for our last goodbye
As I raise my head and gaze up to the skies
I have tried in vain but this is the end
We will meet again
I will be again

7. Midnight Madness
March on the fire in the sky
Live now, tomorrow we may die
Stand strong, desire to survive
'Til the end of time

No more, you'll never walk alone
Starlight will guide us to our home
Reborn, the sands of time are sown
'Til we claim our throne

Aggravation, termination
Generations in starvation
Mass salvation of the nation now

We will fly tonight towards the angels
See our stars shine bright into the sky
We will stand tonight and live forever
We're the masters of the stars and of all time

We will fly tonight towards the angels
See our stars shine bright into the sky
And we will stand tonight and live forever
We're the masters of the stars and of all time

Dark clouds, the symphony of war
Stare now into the crystal ball
Stay strong and face the winter storm
'Til the final call

Strike now, the power from within
Hunt down and crush them for their sins
This time the battle we will win
So it now begins

Suffocation, desperation
From sedation to predation
Blind destruction of creation now

We will fly tonight towards the angels
See our stars shine bright into the sky
We will stand tonight and live forever
We're the masters of the stars and of all time

We will fly tonight towards the angels
See our stars shine bright into the sky
And we will stand tonight and live forever
We're the masters of the stars and of all time

Once lost but now we're free
To the night we hold the key
Silently we wait the last command

Guardians of space and time
To the mountain we must climb
At the gates of glory we now stand
For the final stand

We will fly tonight towards the angels
See our stars shine bright into the sky
We will stand tonight and live forever
We're the masters of the stars and of all time

We will fly tonight towards the angels
See our stars shine bright into the sky
And we will stand tonight and live forever
We're the masters of the stars and of all time

8. War!
Appearing out of nowhere you came into my life
And took control before I realized
I remember clearly the things you used to say
But now I see the truth behind your lies

I try to make you listen, I try to make you see
It's nothing but a total waste of time
You think you know better, and do what you do best
You love to bring us down, but now it's time you listen

Caught by the winds of the fury within
Leading slowly to your own demise
Why don't you see that you are your worst enemy?
And that fight must come to an end

War
Now this is war
Straight from the core
Hear the wrath and the thunder
Punishment from the skies
I will crush your empire
Empire of disguise

Blinded and deluded
You think you've seen it all
You think you're always right and can't be wrong
Poisonous and selfish
You cannot face the truth
And blame the world for your pathetic life
You lie, you cheat, you backstab, and you're completely fake
Relying on a fragile house of cards
You always point the finger
How easy must it be?
To spend your life blindfolded and disguised

Caught by the winds of the fury within
Leading slowly to your own demise
Why don't you see that you are your worst enemy?
And that fight must come to an end

War
Now this is war
Straight from the core
Hear the wrath and the thunder
Punishment from the skies
I will crush your empire
Empire of disguise

For so many tears, for so many lies
For so many prophecies never fulfilled
I promise you now, you'll pay for your crimes
It ends tonight

Now this is war
We won't take it anymore

Appearing out of nowhere you came into my life
And took control before I realized
I remember clearly the things you used to say
But now I see the truth behind your lies

Caught by the winds of the fury within
Leading slowly to your own demise
Why don't you see that you are your worst enemy?
And that fight must come to an end

War
Now this is war
Straight from the core
Hear the wrath and the thunder
Punishment from the skies
I will crush your empire
Empire of disguise

9. Land Of Shattered Dreams
Can you imagine your life?
Desolate, detached, and all alone
Your best friend is your desperation
In a world of unbelievers, how are we to keep our dreams alive?
Sometimes escape seems like the answer

Take one last chance
A chance to start it over
Somewhere, somehow
A place we all belong

Within this land of shattered dreams
Where the days seem never-ending
Can you ask yourself tonight what it means?
Can we really leave this world behind?
For just a moment in a lifetime
And a chance to be free
From all reality

Who said that what we all see
Is exactly what we must believe?
Sometimes it's hard to know the difference
In a world of mass illusion
Who are we to question what is real
Sometimes it feels like mass confusion

Take one last chance
A chance to start it over
Somewhere, somehow
A place we all belong

Within this land of shattered dreams
Where the days seem never-ending
Can you ask yourself tonight what it means?
Can we really leave this world behind?
For just a moment in a lifetime
And a chance to be free
From all reality

Take one last chance
A chance to start it over
Somewhere, somehow
A place we all belong

Within this land of shattered dreams
Where the days seem never-ending
Can you ask yourself tonight what it means?
Can we really leave this world behind?
For just a moment in a lifetime
And a chance to be free
From all reality

10. The Edge Of The World
In times of fear and mystery, when the gods had ruled the earth
Sound the bells of victory
The sign of our rebirth
How many died in vain, like waves against the shore
No one hears their whispers anymore

Lost, like the hope in the battle we fought
Through the cold and the rain
Gone, like the years in the shadows and pain, unknown

I've seen through the eyes of the dead
And suffered for them time and again
Granted with immortality
The price for the savior of humanity

Rise from the ashes of mankind
He walks into the fire
With the fate of us all in his hands
And the sadness fills his eyes
The prophecies of Babylon
As he stands at the edge of the world

Long, is the journey, oh, long is the road
As the sun rises over the world
The quest is hard 'til the battle can end
But I have the power in my hands

I've seen through the eyes of the dead
And suffered for them time and again
Granted with immortality
The price for the savior of humanity

Rise from the ashes of mankind
He walks into the fire
With the fate of us all in his hands
And the sadness fills his eyes
The prophecies of Babylon
As he stands at the edge of the world

Honor, the god of Enlil
Silence for the beast is now the prey
Denied a chance for life
I take back that what is mine
Die

Wrath, we rule the skies
May the rain cleanse and wash away
Imperfect, these creations of mine
Corrupted by greed, they shall pay

Chosen, saved from death's embrace

One last chance for man to change his ways
Deified, a place amongst the gods
Saved from mankind's own demise

Rise from the ashes of mankind
He walks into the fire
With the fate of us all in his hands
And the sadness fills his eyes
The prophecies of Babylon
As he stands at the edge of the world

From the ashes of mankind
He walks into the fire
With the fate of us all in his hands
And the sadness fills his eyes
The prophecies of Babylon
As he stands at the edge of the world

At the end of the journey for the savior of the earth
Sound the bells of victory through the signs of our rebirth
As the shadows fade away, we watch the new sun rise
No one fears the darkness anymore

11. Our Final Stand
Time, for so many years we have wandered
Lost in the still of the night, ready to fight
Burning steel agony revealed
A quest to reconquer our land

Marching north, showing no remorse
Our destiny caught in our hands

And one day we will be free again
One more time we will be free again
And we'll break the chains
That bound us and tore us apart

Cry, under the gaze of the moonlight
And blood-red skies
The deafening silence of anguish
Becoming mine

Straight ahead, rising from the dead
An army of relentless souls
We must hold, through the northern cold
We'll fight them until the end

Cleansed by the tears of the fallen
Echoing fears of the warriors
Honor and glory will comfort us all
Living alone, dying alone, we make our final stand

Cleansed by the tears of the fallen
Echoing fears of the warriors
Honor and glory will comfort us all
Living alone, dying alone, we gotta make a final stand

Cleansed by the tears of the fallen
Echoing fears of the warriors
Honor and glory will comfort us all
Living alone, dying alone, we make our final stand

12. Hatred And Revenge
[Bonus Track]I saw the ravens in the distant sky
I searched the mountains for the eternal fire
I fought the dragon through the sands of time
We race through the wind, to glory ride

We cross the valley to the distant sun
We feel the power, our revenge is sworn
We crushed the cities and the war is won
The fire in our soul, we're standing strong

Kingdom
Calling
Raise the cannons of war

Ride from the mountains and rise from the seas
Steel of the warriors, you bow to your knees
Sail through the darkness, the true prophecy
Cursed is the night in the sea of dreams

Ride from the mountains and rise from the seas
Steel of the warriors, you bow to your knees
Sail through the darkness, the true prophecy
Cursed is the night in the sea of dreams

A blaze of light beyond the eastern sky
This dance of doom towards the ivory tower
A vengeful death awaits for all this time
The judgment has passed, we all now die

A maze of torment for a thousand souls
The unseen fury of the ancient scrolls
The years of torture that had been foretold
A lifetime of fear they now behold

Kingdom
Calling
Raise the cannons of war

Ride from the mountains and rise from the seas
Steel of the warriors, you bow to your knees
Sail through the darkness, the true prophecy
Cursed is the night in the sea of dreams

Ride from the mountains and rise from the seas
Steel of the warriors, you bow to your knees
Sail through the darkness, the true prophecy
Cursed is the night in the sea of dreams

I saw the ravens in the distant sky
I searched the mountains for the eternal fire
I fought the dragon through the sands of time
We race through the wind, to glory ride

Kingdom
Calling
Raise the cannons of war

Ride from the mountains and rise from the seas
Steel of the warriors, you bow to your knees
Sail through the darkness, the true prophecy
Cursed is the night in the sea of dreams

Ride from the mountains and rise from the seas
Steel of the warriors, you bow to your knees
Sail through the darkness, the true prophecy
Cursed is the night in the sea of dreams

13. Evil Dead
[Bonus Track][originally by Death]Trapped inside
A life is not yours
Spirits within
Causing terror, fear, and darkness

Evil dead
Evil dead

Voice speaks out
All will die tonight
Insanity
Fills your mind, you hear them call

Evil dead
Evil dead

Covered in blood
All hope is lost
Forever to rot
Controlled by the powers of the

Evil dead
Evil dead

14. Gloria
[Bonus Track][originally by ZIGGY]As I stared at the clouds I could see a vision of you
I could see my desire was still uncertain but still so true
Still I long to believe there will soon be a brighter day
Underneath this disguise still I walk through the pouring rain

I wanna make it tonight
Owaranai yoru ni
You have no need now to cry
Owaranai MERODII wo

So tonight I will send you my own melody
But the time passes by and I can't stop the lies it seems
Still I wait for you now, living life on a broken dream
Cannot hide the frustration inside, now I'm on my knees

I wanna make it tonight

You have no need now to cry

1. The Game
Messed up, once again
told me it's OK
but this path that I'm taking
I'm lost in the deep end

One last chance, never more
told me it's all right
in this sea of denial
I'm cleansed in the fire

So why is it me,
am I blinded or too blind to see?
[growl] (am I too blind to see?!)
why was I born?
not a part of this society?

Again and again I tried
so hard, to reach for the stars
but I failed you all
tried to keep standing tall
never had a real chance at all
but still I'm searching

Same thing, different day
tried to make a change
left with nothing more to live for
but everything to die for
humanity, insanity, the everlasting grip
lost all will to keep trying
our bed we must lie in

So why was I born
Not a part of this society?

Again and again I tried
so hard, to reach for the stars
but I failed you all
tried to keep standing tall
never had a real chance at all
but still I'm searching for

[chorus]
Ten thousand ways to say sorry
but life writes its own tragic story
time marches onwards and
nothing can ever be the same

But we'll pray for a brighter tomorrow
break free from this lifetime of sorrow
years pass us by but we're all just a part of the game

[solos]

2. Tomorrow King
Candles burning, the hours turning
A countdown the day that we're born
Don't look backwards, keep driving forwards
The rose withers but not the thorns

If you want it, then you can take it
Just seize it before it's too late
And if all fails, get back on your feet
There's always another today but still we'll

Pray for one last chance to prove we all belong
Through the dark nights and cold days while time marches on

In this life we're running out of days
We're running out of time, ignoring it's a crime
No regrets, just one shot at glory
Is all we got before we die
Sands of time are slipping through our hands
So try and understand and do it while you can
Don't look back, just one shot at glory
Is all it takes to feel alive

Anger rising with endless fighting
But soon you'll be finally free
Find your way through this endless maze
Be the one that you wanted to be

Pray for one last chance to prove we all belong
Through the dark nights and cold days while time marches on

In this life we're running out of days
We're running out of time, ignoring it's a crime
No regrets, just one shot at glory
Is all we got before we die
Sands of time are slipping through our hands
So try and understand and do it while you can
Don't look back, just one shot at glory
Is all it takes to feel alive

Fear not a twisted future, no matter what it brings
Can't you see now, you're all tomorrow's kings
Tomorrow's kings!

Pray for one last chance to prove we all belong
Through the dark nights and cold days while time marches on

In this life we're running out of days
We're running out of time, ignoring it's a crime
No regrets, just one shot at glory
Is all we got before we die
Sands of time are slipping through our hands
So try and understand and do it while you can
Don't look back, just one shot at glory
Is all it takes to feel alive

3. No More
[feat. Matt Heafy]The light is shining
Still I'm not so surprised
One thousand voice mails
For one thousand lies

Blind faith, lost trust
All along it was plain to see
Years passed, lost touch
Leads the path to insanity

Take another shot, show me what you got
It was never gonna last forever
Open your eyes, try and realize
Once is enough so tonight now I say

No more, from a voice that breaks the awkward silence
No more, never heard so loud before
Made the same mistakes a thousand times
Never meant to be like this so I say
No more tonight
And it feels all right

Dark nights, long passed
Waking up from a pointless dream
Brighter days, brighter times
Hides the fatal reality

Questions, answers
False addiction to nothing real
Lights fade, crushed to dust
Desperation in tragedy

Take another shot, show me what you got
It was never gonna last forever
Open your eyes, try and realize
Once is enough so tonight now I say

No more, from a voice that breaks the awkward silence
No more, never heard so loud before
Made the same mistakes a thousand times
Never meant to be like this so I say
No more tonight
And it feels all right

(No more) Same old game we play together
(No more) Time will pass, we'll still remember
(No more) But tonight this game is over
(No more) Strangers in the night forever

No more, from a voice that breaks the awkward silence
No more, never heard so loud before
Made the same mistakes a thousand times
Never meant to be like this so I say
No more tonight
And it feels all right

And it feels all right

4. Three Hammers
Lost long ago through the ages of time
Once ruled immortal, the guardians of light
Bonded together, they stood side by side
Storm winds brought darkness, the world in decline

Quest for their hammers to reclaim the throne
Three brought together by warriors unknown
United to vanquish all hell from the earth
Conquering glory, the kingdom's rebirth

Raise your swords, sound the final war cry
Stand, fight, fight for your lives
Thousands will die but their deaths not in vain
Now reunited our world may be free once again

Three hammers high, in the burning red sky
Forged in the fire, protectors of mankind
Three hammers high, for the world we unite
Fight for our lives, as we hold up the three hammers high

Long have we travelled through forgotten lands
From coldest valleys to burning red sands
Restless we ride through the depths of all hell
Triumph and agony, death will prevail

Raise your swords, sound the final war cry
Stand, fight, fight for your lives
Strike back with vengeance, 'til death we defend
Until the day that the dragons will rise once again

Three hammers high, in the burning red sky
Forged in the fire, protectors of mankind
Three hammers high, for the world we unite
Fight for our lives, as we hold up the three hammers high

Strike down the unbelievers
March on for justice we now stand
Once more the path for glory
Take back the power in our hands

Long years of terror and the long years of pain
Still marching onwards 'til victory's ours once again
Victory's ours once again

Three hammers high, in the burning red sky
Forged in the fire, protectors of mankind
Three hammers high, for the world we unite
Fight for our lives, as we hold up the three hammers high

5. Symphony Of The Night
Hiding in the fog
Where darkness meets the moonlight
I will sing a melody 'til the morning comes
Living for you only
Take my hand and show me
There will be much sorrow when the morning comes

Fearless I’m fighting the pain burns inside of me
Find the forces of my soul
No one can understand me
Am I condemned to ride the blackest night alone?

Tragic painting on the walls
In this castle where affliction reigns
So many died in vain
Hear their distant cries
Never again!

This is my symphony
My dark blessing falls from the skies
I hear the voice
Rising from the void
Of the memories gone by
Dark is the path for me
I’ll find my peace another way
Under the stars where we’ll shine again some day

Torment and sadness unleashed through these corridors
Fear is leading to the night
Bloodline of vampires doomed to fulfill their need
Once united by the light
Father! Look into my eyes
I shall kill you tonight to avenge
All those who died in vain
Hear their distant cries
Never again!

This is my symphony
My dark blessing falls from the skies
I hear the voice
Rising from the void
Of the memories gone by
Dark is the path for me
I’ll find my peace another way
Under the stars where we’ll shine again some day

[Solo]

This is my symphony
My dark blessing falls from the skies
I hear the voice
Rising from the void
Of the memories gone by
Dark is the path for me
I’ll find my peace another way
Under the stars where we’ll shine again some day

'Til the stars where we’ll shine again some day
'Til the stars where we’ll shine again some day

6. The Sun Is Dead
Inception
Death’s guiding us away
We fight 'til the end
Among the ruins
Illusion
Of brighter days ahead
Through confusion and hatred, we try to understand
In silence we stand alone

Caught in the eye
A quest for life beneath the stormy sky
The strength to rise again

Time to realize
Our race has come to nothing
We'll start it all again

The sun is dead now
Fading away forever
The darkness prevails now
But with the prayers of the dead
Now a new light ascends from the stars

Confusion
The sadness and the pain
Matricide, the earth is now dead
Remember the brighter days
When hope and joy were shining in our hearts
Times have changed now, we suffer yet try to understand
In silence, we stand alone

Caught in the eye
The fragments of my past to realize
It's time to rise again

In the world's demise
Our race has come to nothing
We'll start it all again

The sun is dead now
Fading away forever
The darkness prevails now
But with the prayers of the dead
Now a new light ascends from the stars

The sun is dead now
But in the end, what did we learn?

The sun is dead now
Fading away forever
The darkness prevails now
But with the prayers of the dead
Now a new light ascends from the stars

Now a new light ascends from the stars

7. Defenders
Life's uncertain, a rat-race of pain
Endlessly searching for more
Hopeless and needless, held back by the chains
'Til we can't take anymore

Hold on, stay strong
Breaking out from the past life fading
No more, what for?
All we got is to keep on praying

Pray for the done for their lives in dismay
Witness the final decay
Suffering in silence for years we were blind
But now we got something to say

Hold on, stay strong
'Til the end, not afraid of dying
No more, what for?
Nothing left but to keep on fighting

[Pre-chorus:]
United, incited, not misguided
We'll fight through time before our one true destiny
Benighted, ignited, still strong and undivided
This day foretold now here for all to see

[Chorus:]
So free in the blue skies with time marches on
Once more maybe we'll find our peace to behold
Strangers in a strange world, defenders through time
Cleansed in a kingdom of fire

Legions of darkness from beyond the grave
Spill their blood under the sun
Voices are calling with anger and rage
The final war now has begun

Hold on, stay strong
'Til the end, not afraid of dying
No more, what for?
Nothing left but to keep on fighting

[Pre-chorus:]
United, incited, not misguided
We'll fight through time before our one true destiny
Benighted, ignited, still strong and undivided
This day foretold now here for all to see

So free in the blue skies with time marches on
Once more maybe we'll find our peace to behold
Strangers in a strange world, defenders through time
Cleansed in a kingdom of unholy fire

Hear our call, save us all
Standing tall tonight

The flame will slowly fade away
The shadows of our lives
We wash away the memories
Before the last sunrise

We'll keep holding on
In times of changes
Standing strong against the wind
Until the end of time

[Solo]

Hold on, stay strong
'Til the end, not afraid of dying
No more, what for?
Nothing left but to keep on fighting

[Pre-chorus:]
United, incited, not misguided
We'll fight through time before our one true destiny
Benighted, ignited, still strong and undivided
This day foretold now here for all to see

So free in the blue skies with time marches on
Once more maybe we'll find our peace to behold
Strangers in a strange world, defenders through time
Cleansed in a kingdom of unholy fire

[2x]
Hear our call, save us all
Standing tall tonight

8. Extraction Zone
"Uh, we got a killstreak coming up if anyone's interested."

It's getting late at night by a freezing moon
The time is running out and the end is soon
An army in despair, don't know what to do

Impure thoughts are raging in this empty room
The victims are escaping, now we shall regroup
The times are getting tougher as we face our doom

A circus of horrors waiting just for you
The barrel's bottom, anything will do
So take my hand and I will lead you right into

Extraction zone, the zone
You can make yourself at home
Extraction zone, your zone
You don't have to feel alone
Where dreams become reality
And standards will now cease to be
So live your life in the extraction zone

Another place, another time, we carry on
Not getting any easier 'cause we're getting on
A creature from another world, it's gone all wrong

A circus of horrors waiting just for you
The barrel's bottom, anything will do
So take my hand and I will lead you right into

Extraction zone, the zone
You can make yourself at home
Extraction zone, your zone
You don't have to feel alone
Where dreams become reality
And standards will now cease to be
So live your life in the extraction zone

As a new dawn will rise
I promise myself, not again
But deep in my heart
The fire still burns just the same
It's just the same

A circus of horrors waiting just for you
The barrel's bottom, anything will do
So take my hand and I will lead you right into

Extraction zone, your zone
You can make yourself at home
Extraction zone, the zone
You don't have to feel alone
Where dreams become reality
And standards will now cease to be
So live your life in the extraction zone

9. City Of Gold
Her dream was to shine on the screen
Thought that was why she was born
Left all behind without a fear inside
But sometimes there's no lucky star to help you

Sun will go down, and she's all alone
Can't help but feel insecure
She'll never stop, the way to the top
Is more than she had bargained for

Her quest for the glory was real
But somehow it turned out all wrong
Heartache was never a part of the dream
Can't find a reason to keep on trying

Turn out the light, 'cause deep in the night
She's like the thousands before
Hold out your hand, there's hope at the end
But be careful what you wish for

Now the lights are all gone
You find yourself on your own
Welcome the night 'cause not all that glitters is gold

Now the city has gone
You find your own way back home
Keep up the fight and you'll find your Kingdom of Gold

Another night out on the streets
Finding a way to survive
Wasting your chances, destroying your dreams
Counting the tears that you cry

Hiding the pain, it drives you insane
But still you're craving for more
So give me your hand, hold on 'til the end
And you can have what you wish for

Now the lights are all gone
You find yourself on your own
Welcome the night 'cause not all that glitters is gold

Now the city has gone
You find your own way back home
Keep up the fight and you'll find your Kingdom of Gold

Now the lights are all gone
You find yourself on your own
Welcome the night 'cause not all that glitters is gold

Now the lights are all gone
You find yourself on your own
Welcome the night 'cause not all that glitters is gold

Now the city has gone
You find your own way back home
Keep up the fight and you'll find your Kingdom of Gold

10. Ring Of Fire
[originally by Johnny Cash]Love is a burning thing
And it makes a fiery ring
Bound by a wild desire
And I fell right into a great ring of fire

And I fell into a burning ring of fire
I went down, down, down as the flames were rising higher
And it burns, burns, burns,
And it burns, burns, burns,
In a ring of fire

The taste of love is sweet
When hearts just like ours meet
I fell for you like a child
But I jumped right in and the fire went wild

When I fell into a burning ring of fire
I went down, down, down as the flames were rising higher
And it burns, burns, burns,
And it burns, burns, burns,
In a ring of fire

Love is a burning thing
And it makes a fiery ring
Bound by a wild desire
And I fell right into a great ring of fire

And I fell into a burning ring of fire
I went down, down, down as the flames were rising higher
And it burns, burns, burns,
And it burns, burns, burns,
In a ring of fire

11. Power And Glory
[Special Edition Bonus Track]A black cloud now falls on this city
But under the lights
Been searching for answers but this time, you
You feel so alive

Just free your own mind, it's not easy
To give all you've got
'Cause no one can stop you from climbing this mountain
And making the top

Run, strive for the fame
Blood of the game, that we play time and again
It's up to you to break these chains

Reasons to live, reasons to die
Live for the power and glory
Never give up, reach for the top
Find your own path and tonight we'll make it
Reasons to live, reasons to die
Live for the power and glory
Never give up, reach for the top
Find your own path and tonight we'll make it
All right

Now everyone wants to be something
A feeling so strong
But only one thing really matters
A place to belong

Don't spend all your days in the shadows
You're not on your own
But just keep on fighting
'Cause you'll never know you've got 'til it's gone

Run, strive for the fame
Blood of the game, that we play time and again
It's up to you to break these chains

Reasons to live, reasons to die
Live for the power and glory
Never give up, reach for the top
Find your own path and tonight we'll make it

12. You're Not Alone
[Special Edition Bonus Track]Emptiness, tears inside,
On the night before she died
Strong the fire that burns so bright inside of me

Through the years, through it all,
You touched my heart you touched my soul.
Never gave up the fight but tonight you'll be free.

All the tears in my own heart beating.
But I want you to know.

High the mountain we must climb
So far beyond the ocean's tide
We're torn apart but soon we'll all be home.
And our hearts forevermore entwined
We'll save the night we said goodbye,
No matter where you are, you're not alone.

Long nights on a road we cry
Cold thoughts of a brighter time.
An empty picture in an empty frame
Won't you take me away?

All the pain through my own life's end.
'Til the end of our days.

High the mountain we must climb
So far beyond the ocean's tide
We're torn apart but soon we'll all be home.
And our hearts forevermore entwined.
We'll save the night we said goodbye.
No matter where you are, you're not alone.

High the mountain we must climb so far beyond the ocean's tide.
We're torn apart but soon we'll all be home.
High the mountain we must climb so far beyond the ocean's tide.
We're torn apart but soon we'll all be home.
And our hearts forevermore entwined
We'll save the night we said goodbye.

No matter where you are, you're not alone...

13. Chemical Interference
[Special Edition Bonus Track]Another night, another inner fight
The demon's calling
My soul is dark, but with a touch of light
The whole world's changing

I draw the line, the pleasure redefined
It's now awakening
I feel the urge, emotions on the verge
And now it's time to kill

The speed of light, I feel the time is right
I've smashed all boundaries
A skull crushed, adrenaline rush
The night has found me

Infection spreads, a spirit through my head
The time is coming
I know the score, but I gotta have one more
And for more I could kill

I am what I choose to be, I lose grip on reality
And I have nothing to atone
All your morals thrown in vain, I know my pleasure is my pain
But I'm gonna make it on my own

The sun is up, but I can't get enough
The sky's the limit
I'm on the top, but I ain't gonna stop
I'll never give in

It's in my brain, it's driving me insane
Hallucinations
Always the same, but I ain't gonna save
Destruction, I must kill

I am what I choose to be, I lose grip on reality
And I have nothing to atone
All your morals thrown in vain, I know my pleasure is my pain
But I'm gonna make it on my own

I've seen the sun rise once again
I've lived my life and now I'm dead
Time to come down all on my own

This is nothing new for me
This is my reality
So open your eyes and don't ever hide away

I am what I choose to be, I lose grip on reality
And I have nothing to atone
All your morals thrown in vain, I know my pleasure is my pain
But I'm gonna make it on my own

14. Summer's End
[Japanese Bonus Track]Sometimes we play, sometimes we lose
With pride or with shame
Sometimes a dream turns into dust
But who's there to blame?

Try not to forget, and to understand
And read between the lines
Get back on your feet, you've got one more chance
To make it right this time

The reason we stand
Facing the rising sun the pain goes on and on
We hold deep inside the power to guide us until we touch the sky

The reason we stand with pride
Is the will to live and to reach for the stars
So never look back and we'll keep on fighting until we touch the sky

Sometimes the pain burns deep inside
And all seems in vain
Sometimes the fear darkens the path
And leads us astray

Tears in our eyes and our hopes are fading away
But revenge is sweet, get back on your feet
'Cause a war is upon us today

The reason we stand
Facing the rising sun the pain goes on and on
We hold deep inside the power to guide us until we touch the sky

The reason we stand with pride
Is the will to live and to reach for the stars
So never look back, you're always just one step away

[Solo]

The reason we stand
Facing the rising sun the pain goes on and on
We hold deep inside the power to guide us until we touch the sky

The reason we stand with pride
Is the will to live and to reach for the stars
So never look back, and we'll keep fighting until we touch the sky

(The reason we stand)
The reason we stand
(Facing the rising sun the pain goes on and on)
Pain goes on and on
(We hold deep inside the power to fighting until we touch the sky)
Fighting until we touch the sky

(Ah will to live and to reach for the stars)
The power we hold deep inside until we touch the sky

Just one step away!

15. Fight To Be Free
[Special Edition Bonus Track]
[originally by Shadow Warriors]Coming down from the mountain ranges
For the battle of ancient ages
Fight hard for the warrior soul
Wage war, ride on 'til our destiny calls

Through the valley of black wind, burning sun
See the warrior fight, the time has come
Fight on for the powerful Lord
March on, stand strong 'til the end of the world

When the sun and stars will align again
And the land is dark and gone
And the ring of fire will be born again
For the one

We just want to dream about it
We die to believe without it
The fire in our hearts, in our song
The price at the gates far beyond

And when the hands of all the nation will arise
And as the sun will shine across the blazing skies
Through the wind and through the trees
For the honor of family, black ninja ride on
Fight to be free

For our fallen fathers we will fight
For the glory of master through the night
Over mountains, by the sea
To the land far away where the warrior lives
See the ninja ride with evil sword
For the power of powerful overlord
March on for the glory of all
Ride on, fight hard for the warrior call

When the sun and stars will align again
And the land is dark and gone
And the ring of fire will be born again
For the one

We just want to dream about it
We die to believe without it
The fire in our hearts, in our song
The price at the gates far beyond

When the sun and stars will align again
And the land is dark and gone
And the ring of fire will be born again
For the one

We just want to dream about it
We die to believe without it
The fire in our hearts, in our song
The price at the gates far beyond

And when the hands of all the nation will arise
And as the sun will shine across the blazing skies
Through the wind and through the trees
For the honor of family, black ninja ride on
Fight to be free

1. Through The Fire And The Flames
On a cold winter morning, in the time before the light
In flames of death's eternal reign we ride towards the fight
When the darkness has fallen down, and the times are tough all right
The sound of evil laughter falls around the world tonight

Fighting hard, fighting on for the steel, through the wastelands evermore
The scattered souls will feel the hell bodies wasted on the shores
On the blackest plains in hell's domain, we watch them as we go
In fire and pain, and once again we know

So now we fly ever free
We're free before the thunderstorm
On towards the wilderness our quest carries on
Far beyond the sundown, far beyond the moonlight
Deep inside our hearts and all our souls

[Chorus:]
So far away we wait for the day
For the lives all so wasted and gone
We feel the pain of a lifetime lost in a thousand days
Through the fire and the flames we carry on

As the red day is dawning
And the lightning cracks the sky
We'll raise our hand to the heavens above
With resentment in their eyes
Running back from the mid-morning light
With a burning in my heart
We're banished from a time in a fallen land
To a life beyond the stars

In your darkest dreams see to believe
Our destiny is time
And endlessly we'll all be free tonight

And on the wings of a dream, so far beyond reality
All alone in desperation, now the time has come
Lost inside you'll never find, lost within my own mind
Day after day this misery must go on

[Chorus]

[Solos: Twin/Sam/Twin/Herman/Twin/Herman/Sam/Herman/Sam]

Now here we stand with their blood on our hands
We fought so hard now can we understand
I'll break the seal of this curse if I possibly can
For freedom of every man

[Chorus]

2. Revolution Deathsquad
Flying over darkened skies the battle will call
Distant angels crying in the eye of the storm
And the world falls under the starlight shining from heavens below
Long years of pain and sorrow searching for more
Cry for the touch of angels never before
And the stars fall on the horizon onwards and up through the pain

Ride the wind and fight the demon steel shining bright
Standing together forever onwards flames burning strong
Hot wind in hell of pain and sorrow now and ever onwards
We stare into the dawn of a new world

[Pre-chorus]
Cry out for the fallen heroes
Lost in time ago
In our minds they still belong
When the sands of time are gone

[Chorus]
Rise over shadow mountains blazing with power
Crossing valleys endless tears in unity we stand
Far and wide across the land the victory is ours
On towards the gates of reason
Fight for the truth and the freedom
Gloria

Searching through the memories to open the door
Living on the edge of life like never before
And the ground chants under the moonlight facing their fears all the same

Heavens fear now open wide and up for the the call
All in stark reality the angels will fall
And the world cries out for the silence lost in the voices unknown

Blinded by the force of evil cries into the night
Never before have they seen the darkness now they are all gone
Out from the shadows storming on the wings of revelations
Your soul will feel no mercy come the dawn

Hold on for the morning after
Never to let go
In the fire's burning strong
When the tides of time roll on

[Chorus]

[Solos: Herman/Twin/Sam/Herman/Twin/Twin Blast/Herman/Sam/Herman/Sam]

[Pre-chorus]

[Chorus]

Gloria
Gloria

3. Storming The Burning Fields
Bursting through the fires avenging
Fatal warning battles are raging
Power of darkness rise for the fight
We'll be strong and stand our ground

Death is all around us and my heart is beating weaker
Fight the day with power of immortal souls arise
Fire in our hearts the evil rages on forever more
Burning until the battle rage is gone

Through damnation we rise sign of the times master of bleeding eyes
Thunder and high look to the sky you never gonna take us down!

[Chorus]
And we will crush the evil standing on the temple in the fire storming
Fly beyond the lost horizons high
Heroes of the night are calling
See the promised land is falling
Reaching for the powers deep inside
On through the night

Blinded by the hate and desire
Burning in your heart like a fire
Challenging all the suffer and fear our horizons take control
Blood spills all around us and our enemies draw nearer
Sacrifice your life to have them carry you away
Take us to the place of death and carry on forever more
Burning on the dreams of memories long gone!

And you'll die for your crimes sign of the times master of endless lies
Fight to the end now we ascend together we will take them down

[Chorus]

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Solos: Herman/Sam/Herman/Sam]

[Chorus]

4. Operation Ground And Pound
Smashing through the boundaries
Storming through the burning fields
Stand before the evil one on towards the morning sun
Falling under skies of pain

Still we're searching endlessly
Crashing over seven seas
Torturing the winter skies riding over plains of ice
Shadows in the fields of the slain!

Crashing steel and raging fury smash the quest destroy their army
Crush the legions of the twilight, templars of steel will burn

Cry far away as we reach for the day
Blasting our way through the punishment and the pain
Reach for the world as the sky begins to fall
Rising through the darkened ashes praying that I'll see you all

[Chorus:]
Far away will our eyes now see the day
For today, the everlasting eternal sun
Washed away the dreams of a brighter day
Forever hold the dream inside the chance to fight another fight
The breaking hearts that stand for all our lives
Live tonight

Watch you die I watch you die inside while fear controls your life
And reject this animosity that killed so many minds
You feel the power deep within the fear you hold inside
Just to find the reason for the treason now you will be mine

Screams of pain in death descending rise again from hell defending
Burn their hearts within the fire, warriors of light will be slain

Rise through the pain like the sun will rise again
Day after day but the memories never change
Stand before the storm as the last horizon falls
Blinded by the vision and the innocence of our souls

[Chorus]

[Solos: Sam/Herman/Sam]

Far away will our eyes now see the day
For today the everlasting eternal sun

[Chorus]

WO...

[Solo: Herman]

5. Body Breakdown
Silent screams and shattered dreams of what we left at seventeen
Still lost within the misery and pain that lies inside
Here alone the fight to breathe still searching for the truth to be
Blackened by the burning fire held deep inside my mind!

Far beyond the lost horizon standing on the shore
Across the seas their hearts will bleed this life we're waiting for
Taste the steel in pain you kneel for glory we defend
Our fallen souls will rise to fight again!

Stay here with me this night we'll be together
Future in our hands we'll fight with freedom drawing near
Stand here with me for we will live forever
Tonight we stand and face it all

Falling rain will hide the pain that lies beneath the burning flames
All hope is gone so carry on before the world will fall
Rise again to die in vain now life can never be the same
Our own salvation drawing nearer hear the darkness call

Skies are falling thunder storming stand before the world
We're banished now to barren wastelands fight the demon whore
Riding on through blackened darkness cross the endless sands
We sail away our victory at hand!

Stay here with me together we'll be stronger
Side by side we've conquered lands and stormed across the seas

Die here with me we feel this pain no longer
For now and ever we will be

[Chorus:]
In my heart, in my soul, I am out of control
Fly across the mountains and towards the distant sun
Tears evermore we cry like before
Feel the breakdown of my body - set me free

[Solo: Sam]

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Solo: Herman / Sam / Vadim]

[Super Bridge]

[Solo: Sam/Vadim/Herman]

In my heart in my soul I am out of control
Fly across the mountains and towards the distant sun
Tears evermore, we cry like before
Feel the breakdown of my body
In my heart in my soul I am out of control
Fly across the mountains and towards the distant sun
Tears evermore, we cry like before
Feel the breakdown of my body
Feel the breakdown of my body
Set me free

6. Cry For Eternity
Falling from the sky now, the sign of the burning sun
Into the face of the evil one
Nowhere to hide now we're on the run right before your eyes

We're watching, we're waiting, our souls are forsaken
The sign of the warriors, the evil will rise

Through the fire and the flames, breaking the chains
Into the night we go
Torment and pain trample the slain
Soldiers of death we know

[Pre-chorus]
Our steel will shine forever through the night and blinding rain!
We'll see them face their fears; it's time to rise again in everlasting pain

[Chorus]
Fly free for what we believe
One thousands hearts bleeding the eternal dream
Feel me the touch we all need
So silently now we will kneel
Cry for eternity

See now the fallen will live again
They feel the pain burn inside of them
Remember now what you feel again deep down inside
Still cursing still crawling we're endlessly falling
The downfall of mankind the fate of us all

Hold your hands to the sky bleed and you cry
Screaming until we know
Dying in pain again and again
Onwards to hell below

Stand strong we'll live together raging through the barren lands
Our eyes have seen the sorrow far across the sands
The power in our hands

[Chorus]

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Solos: Sam/Sam/Sam/Herman/Herman]

Fly far away to the end of our days
The voices of long distant cries
Now we remain in this labyrinth of pain
And so we ride into the night

[Pre-chorus]

[Chorus]

Cry for eternity

[Solos: Sam/Herman]

7. The Flame Of Youth
Close your eyes hear the thunder and rain
Fear inside of the torturing pain
For the cries of the world and the last lives remain

Chain your heart swear to die for their gain
Deep inside slowly fading away
And the last breathe remains and the fear turns to rage

Locked in a world by the fallen evil souls
Torn right apart for your life insane
Burning in my mind now to bring my life to hold
Reach out and die in the flames
See through the lies and their ever staring eyes
Now is the time to defend your ground
Destiny will call to remind us all now
Fly free so far from here
This life we know will end
In dreams of everlasting pain
The fallen now rise again

Through the fire, through the flames Like the sun will rise again
Lost in time
Lost in space
To the end of all their days

See their endless ways insanity
The quest deranged not meant to be
In flames will now forever burn eternally

[Chorus]
So free your heart leave your life far behind
In the cold of winter skies escape the pain inside
Now feel your soul lost in seas of all eternity
Everyday this life, defending and the flames of youth not ending
In a lifetime, searching, we must fight through the eternal pain

So alone in the world far away,
memories of a dream will remain
As the world's falling cold and our lives all in vain

Fire in my soul will forever rise again
Nothing in my mind to remember now
Broken by the fear of the dark night calling
Ride free on endless seas
The final curtain falls
Cut the ground from down below
The time to lock and to load

Through the fire, through the rain,
far across the distant plains
Feel the wind beneath the steel
as your mind becomes insane
Save the pain from all humanity,
their rides trough our destiny
For freedom now we rise for all again

[Chorus]

[Solos: Herman/Sam/Vadim/Herman/Sam]

So free your heart leave your life far behind
In the cold of winter skies escape the pain inside
And when the memories are all but left behind
And the days have gone forever, lost within my mind
Now feel your soul burn in seas of all eternity
Every day of this life defending and the flames of youth not ending
In a lifetime searching we must fight through the eternal pain

We fight through the eternal pain

8. Trail Of Broken Hearts
Here we are far beyond the distant sky
Seen all the world and how the story will be over
Through the snow and tainted mountains we have climbed
Now we have found the light that guides us over
Through the fallen rain we travelled far and wide
And through the blackest darkness
Stars above shining bright

Through the sun and winter rain will fall
All our lives we all were waiting for a sign to call
We're walking hand in hand in dreams and endless time
How do we know when we will leave this life behind?

Stare at life through eyes of mine
the hate the fear and the pain
There's a feeling held deep inside - when life you live is in vain

[Chorus]
Fly away down the lonely roads of yesterday
We close your eyes to see the light of brighter days
And all alone we'll be where time can never heal
With the trail of broken hearts flying free

Once again we walk this lonely road
There are times that we are wading through the rain and cold
We're lost in memories of what we left behind
Relive the dreams, the endless screams of pain inside

Lives are filled with emptiness
The fear returned once again
Searching endlessly you cannot see
Drown your mind in the pain

[Chorus]

The last temptation will be all that's left for me

When I see those tears you cry
When I hear those lies you lie
When I see your creation now falling down on me
Is this the reason to be?

[Solos: Sam/Herman/Sam]

[Chorus]

The trail of broken hearts flying free

9. Lost Souls In Endless Time
[Bonus Track]

Spend all our lives
On what we believe in
Struggle day by day
But never retrieving
Taking our chances
And follow the footsteps
Ancestors will take us to this fight
At the time it was blistering snowing

Never really know about
Where we were going
Time is coming now
To cross over
Here and now until
The curtain lowers

Slaying all the evil down below
Onwards we ride now
To what we know
Strong enough to stay
And carry on forever
Brace your soul
To fight whenever

Never know how far we travelled
We will have our stand
Across the deepest oceans
Gold is in our hands
Good things will come
For those who wait we can't deny
Still the battle raging and the fire burns inside

Take you with me, we will fly across the sea
To the land of the sun where our journeys begun
All fear is gone, we sail until the dawn
Deepest fears will burn inside your mind
For the souls lost in endless time

Searching never ending
For the chaos ascending
You forgot the spirits
All times pretending
Passing shades of darkness
In the world around you
Finally insanity
In death has found you.

On the edge of life
Trying to pull you under
Deep inside the storm
There's a raging thunder
Sacrifice your innocence
For persecution
As we now prepare
For the revolution

Slaying all the evil down below
Onwards we ride now
To what we know
Strong enough to stay
And carry on forever
Brace your soul
To fight whenever

In a time of fire we're searching
Blind inside the mind
Run away to hell's damnation
One day we will find
Suddenly the skies are falling
Too late for us all
Crashing down on all creation
As the towers fall

Take you with me, we will fly across the sea
To the land of the sun where our journeys begun
All fear is gone, we sail until the dawn
Deepest fears will burn inside your mind
For the souls lost in endless time

[Solos: Vadim / Key Blast]

Stand Before the worlds of freedom
Rise above them all
Ride towards the battle raging
Victory behold
Blackened Steel of death tonight
Our legions now descend
Far Beyond the gates of glory
Time to rise again

[Solos: Sam / Herman / Sam / Herman]

Take you with me, we will fly across the sea
To the land of the sun where our journeys begun
All fear is gone, we sail until the dawn
Deepest fears will burn inside your mind

Take you with me, we will fly across the sea
To the land of the sun where our journeys begun
All fear is gone, we sail until the dawn
Deepest fears will burn inside your mind

For the souls lost in endless time
For the souls lost in endless time
For the souls lost in endless time

1. Ferrum Aeternum
[Instrumental]

2. Iron
The silence breaks the ground
A shadow is riding the horizon
An arcane man arrives to town
Remoresless and condemned
Tasted the snake's poison
Broken every bone
Felt a thousand gunshot wounds
But there's nothing that whiskey can't cure

Ride Through the crossfire
Ride Through the flames, like a predator in the night
The eagles fly into eternal sunset
The heroes die, dying for their pride

Awoken to heavy galloping
I heard the blasting whiplash
Eyes are filled with lust to kill
Beware, he's crying out your name
Now the time has come
When the Iron tears the heart
And the trumpets will ring loudly
As the stars are painted with blood

Blazing fire under the moon
Burning taste of lead
We'll ride forever
Cause' the Iron is stronger than death

3. Sword Chant
[Grim man's tale:]
[I:]
A flaming blade of the dark shadows struck the lands
With furious lightning it fell into the hands of man
And the ancient fire came down
Down from the sky into the ground
The clouds moved aside as the sword was cast from the sky
Burnt by a mark of fire, who shall make this find
And the grey clouds were watching down, down from the sky into the ground
...As the shapes of light were drowned

[II:]
Courage's started crowling from the ashes and smoke
And the night was cursed and drifting within the winds so cold
And the knights from the sea were marching down
To the deep caverns down, down where the old spells are found
The war was growing in the old lands and towns
From the mountains war drums pounded with a deafening sound
They'll seek the Sword forevermore, until in battle they'll fall
...Now, hear the battle's call

Who dares to play with death
Who smells the dragon's breath
No grief for the fallen ones
The search for the sword has begun

[Carved in stone:]
Great as the mountains and seas
Grim as the earth and old trees
Made from the glimmer of golden lakes
Chained with fire that never fades
Rocks and stones they carve and mould
When the rivers run fierce and cold
May this chant haunt your past
For this Sword is yours at last

Raise the arms the battle is near
Through the mud and waters clear
The blood is coloring the lands again
A sign of victory the wind will send

4. Mourning Heart (Interlude)
[Instrumental]

5. Tale Of Revenge
He bears a tale so gloom and tragic never to be known
Into darkness now fallen, into hatred now grown
Like stillborn child drifting in the silent seas
Of blood, crushing all his dreams

No castle walls can hold the fury in his eyes
Devotion for death, now controls his life
No gold or silver can bring him consolation
Only one thing is left inside him, the desire of revenge

One light so cold and pale, sleeping quietly all alone
One life so old and gray, wandering away from home

Parted with a horrid cry, snow falls on his grief
United by the sword of wicked screams
What deeds he has done to hear those deadful sounds
In the ruins of memories he wanders, forever bound

Forever bound to death!

Wait for me in the mountains, haunt me in the winds
Wait for me in the land where nothing lives
Until the day I have found revenge, I will feed my sword
Until my heart is cold, every breath of mine is yours

6. Lost In Despair
I was lost, on my own
And I couldn't bear the thought of my life
I was gone, caught in the torturing memories
And they burned like fire
Water can never heal such pain

Can't you believe
Nothing is real
Can't you see
I cannot feel

Take me away
Bury me in the sand
Cause after all these years I am still the same
A sad and bitter man

Crush my hope, grow my hate
There's no home for me
Nothing to give, nothing to say
So tell me it's a dream

7. Slayer Of Light
I have come to unfold your mind
In my veins runs the poison wild
In the streams of mountains I flow
I have opened the doors for unleashed and endless hate
It will burn like the raging green flames
Inside a man dwell secrets so cold

Through the dreadful storms, across the frozen oceans
I have come from the dark lands with sorrow in my hands
The firewind rages in the sky
And my luminous sword hungers for more
I will leave no one alive
For I am the Slayer of Light

I... I will break your will
I... I will crush your faith
I... I will slay your dreams
I will reclaim the stars and I will tear your precious world apart
I will tear it apart

I will pull everything with me under the surface
And all the screams will fade into my dreams
Fall now! Dying light!
I will burn away the ground beneath your feet
And all will be vanished in the darkness
Dying light! Fall now!
And let the night arrive

8. Into Battle
We left our homes behind, now we're following the wolves' trail
Through the deepest forests, beneath the stars we ride
I can see the moon glowing red like the blood of warriors
There's a prophecy, that tonight many men will die
The fire will burn forever in our passionate hearts
Our destinies are calling us now
We are ready to take their lives

Into battle we ride with Gods by our side
We are strong and not afraid to die
We have an urge to kill and our lust for blood has to be fulfilled
WE'LL FIGHT TILL THE END! And send our enemies straight to Hell!

Prominent leaders, cast your swords in the wind as a sign of war
Men, prepare for death, 'cause we might never return

Blood will spill and heads will fall
As the swords sparkle, lights the night
The ground rumbles as we attack
In the throes of rage, we will fight
The lightning's flash, the thunder's roar
Will petrify the weak
We'll show no mercy, we'll kill them all!
We are sworn in the name of steel

9. Lai Lai Hei
[x2]
Hän katsoi maan reunalta tähteä putoavaa
Nyt kauniit kasvot neitosen peittää karu maa
Jokaisen täytyy katsoa silmiin totuuden
Sillä aika ompi voittoisa, mut' tämä maa on ikuinen
[English translation]
He gazed the falling star from the edge of the world
Now the face of the maiden are covered by rough land
Everyone has to look in the eyes of the truth
Because the time is victorious, but this land is eternal

There's a place in the North, far far away
Home for the wandering man
Dreaming fields with skies so pale
Calm is the glorious land
Flames will send the sign to the sky
That we have come to feast tonight
The lakes are echoing with our song
Shadows are dancing on the forrest wall
Shadows are dancing on the forrest wall!

Enchantment of the fire and moon
Lost in the whispering night
The raven's magic enthralls the woods
Crawling in the sweet starlight
We have gathered in this distant land
Full of wisdom, secrets and tales
The morning will never rise again
Roaming wolves are howling for the dead
Roaming wolves are howling for the dead!
Oh yea!

He watched a falling star, at the edge of the world
Now the maiden's beautiful face is covered in barren earth
Everyone has to look into the eyes of the thruth,
For time is victorious, but this land will always stay true

10. Tears
Shadows of evening on a traveller's way
Destiny tells where the strange path will lead you
Alone I've been walking this path every day
Under the stars and the white silver moon
I hear a song and I'm closing my eyes
While its sound is carresing my poor and sad mind
Will you tonight give your promise to me
For one day the silence will sleep in your dreams

I've been waiting for so long time
To see the light of the golden bright sun
I feel no sorrow in the heart of mine
For the tears of life are now gone

Winds are whispering in the sacred forest
Dancing and singing with the red autumn leaves
These memories I could never forget
With rising sun I shall be here with thee

12. Tears
Shadows of evening on a traveller's way
Destiny tells where the strange path will lead you
Alone I've been walking this path every day
Under the stars and the white silver moon
I hear a song and I'm closing my eyes
While its sound is carresing my poor and sad mind
Will you tonight give your promise to me
For one day the silence will sleep in your dreams

I've been waiting for so long time
To see the light of the golden bright sun
I feel no sorrow in the heart of mine
For the tears of life are now gone

Winds are whispering in the sacred forest
Dancing and singing with the red autumn leaves
These memories I could never forget
With rising sun I shall be here with thee

18. Iron

19. Treacherous Gods
The Land Is Silent... Before The Storm!

On the vast fields of snow, the wind is blowing strong
With it's frozen cold and relentless touch
it leaves a dead and hollow land of ice

I have seen through the eyes of a wolf
and felt all its pain and loneliness
The beautiful land opened before my eyes
wild as a beast I ran into the night

The Calling Of The Howling Wind
Is Raging In The Realms Of North
Creations Of Ice Rising Mighty Into The Skies
And Treacherous Gods Shall Fall

Watching through the falling snow
there's no sign of life
The fire has gone out in the whirl of time
Behold the face of thunder
the storm is getting near
When the sky calls my name, I have no fear

They brought us misfortune, but their honor is about to be crushed
My blood flows cold as streams of the North
We'll never let them take our souls
The calling of the howling wind is raging in the North
Creations of ice, rising mighty into the skies
and Treacherous Gods shall fall

Time And Time Again
I Witness The Birth Of A New Born Star
I Climb The Highest Mountain
To Find The Essence Of A New Era

I guess I tramp these paths
till the end
If you, my love, stand at my side
On these paths the last "cross" is found
To where we are heading together my friend

I wouldn't swap my native region to a foreign
Even though so many would avoid this land
This farm passed from the father to the son
Even though the neighbour sold his.
I listened to my heart
It told stay here
From the world your happiness
you can't find
You came with me
to the shared home
Wilderness too
You loved so much

These roots won't
be detached by the storms
We won't be fallen
because of the breakers of life
To the children we can
Give something
That the children from the cities can't have
If one listens to the heart
It says – stay here
From the world your happiness
You can't find
It is so close,
When you just notice it
And not just reach behind the seas.

1. Frost
[Demo (1997)]

Howling winds of the North
The cold predator of the fells
Mighty woods of the North
Under cover of darkness
Desolate and dying lands
Barren ground, covered with snow
There forever I am,
Where cold winds blow

Gathering thoughts, take me
Into a whirl of silence
Gathering thoughts, give me
Strength to survive

Wail to me my winds
Fly away with frozen wings
Take my life to your hands
O' cold wasteland... of Frost

Great land of the North
The ice shimmering upon the lakes
Great storms of the North
All life frozen to death
Freezing days of sorrow
I'm alone in this infertile world
In the year before time

2. Old Man
So much farther off than time could reach
Today it would be too late
So much despair he has bled
But will he wither away
No one knows that you must keep
This Old Man wide awake
'cause no one knows that he could feed
Our lives with a brighter flame

[Chorus 1:]
Hush little dreamer, the bearer of light
Has come to set you free
Now little dreamer at last you can sigh
'cause the nightmares will be released

[Chorus 2:]
Sweeter far than life from I found that love was
Sweeter far than love to die as he did
[J. L. Runeberg]

[Repeat chorus 1]

The stars fell from the nightsky
As he reached his hands in the air
As the sun peeked between the trees
The Old Man burst to tears

[Repeat chorus 2]

3. Knighthood
I walk through the calm forest in the time of knights
And only the dark memories are left from these times
There's pieces of armour on skeletons
Of men lying on the ground
They were killed by the stab of the sword

Before me lays thousands of dead knights
Beneath of my feets lays skeletons
And only the dark memories
Are left of this Knighthood

On this ground all fought for domination,
But no one stayed alive
And no one knows why that even one life,
Didn't survive
It must have been the powers of evil,
That killed the rest of the men
On this bloodstained ground,
That which stories has been told

4. The Dreamer's Prelude
[Demo 2 (1999)]

[Instrumental]

5. Little Dreamer
Once there was a boy back in time of the heathens
Day after day he just kept dreaming things that would make him weaker
His father could not make him see, that there is more than dreams
But he wouldn't listen to the words of his father, 'cause he's a little dreamer

Along his quest for solitude
A wise man came and told him to follow the stars

He ran to the forest with whirlwinds by his side
He's lost in this world of lies
Take him back where rivers flow upwards
He is the one who lives under a moonless sky looking for time
Take him back where stars are shining bright

Far in the lands of icetop mountains far on the other side
Pictures are appearing so serenely into my mind
Far in the lands of meadows of fire deep in forgotten life
Memories are drifting away so silently from light

Along his path of misery
A wise man came and told him to follow... the stars
Little Dreamer...

6. Warrior's Quest
(Let me tell you a story of a great warrior...)

Strike with the powers of magic stone
Grab your legacy that you behold
If you can find your destiny
Then you may return back to your home
... Ride away with your mighty horse
Ride away through the land of storms...
Unknown ar the ways of your journey ahead
But with strength and courage you can avoid your death

Throw your sword through the memories
Embracing your bleeding heart
Don't follow the shadows they ain't for real
Like guiding stars

As he falls to eternity the truth is fading
Part of him died long time ago but still there's death awaiting

Go now brave warrior don't look back
The stars will guide you through the night
But even the brightest light,
Won't reach to the darkest night...

7. White Storm
On this dawn the colours of the autumn are reflected by a light
A light that as been captured for years in oblivion

Circles of wind are raging now
And so his powers are slowly dying
Before the coldness rapes the lands
His spirit is wandering into the night... to DIE!

...and he heard chimes ahead playing these enchanted notes,
That lead him to a wooden cabin, where he could rest for the night...

Over the mountains
He had travelled
Across the oceans
Deep in the night
Now when it's time to
Say last farewell
Show us your power
Show us your might
Gift from the sky

His eyes can see it so clearly now
But his restless mind cannot sense it in the air

THE WHITE STORM IS CLOSE!

...and his powers gained in this mystical place more than he ever
Posessed before.
So now he could rule the realms of ice... ONCE AGAIN!

[Instrumental]

9. Hero In A Dream
A witch read from the palm of his hand
That his life would turn into darkness
And alone he would face all demons
From his past that he tries to forget
An elder king warned of the dangers
That lie in the valleys of north and
His only chance was to find his shadow
So he had to set forth

He is the man who travels in the land
Of dragons and magic spells
He rides in the winds of fire and snow
And he rules the forest of elves

Slash of the golden sword
A flash in the burning night
Curse of the evil lord
He is fighting for his life for the last time

Oh such beauty in time, but it's just external
He cannot see the truth with his eyes, so he is bound by a lie

The snow starts falling in paradise, as he gazes at the stars
He will be born again in the sky, when the night turns into a dawn

On the way to the ancient castle of time
He will soon be damned by rage
So that his pride could betray him
When it's time to set him free
The fears in his mind had to be pushed aside
As he walked through the gates
He will never die
'cause he is truly a Hero in a Dream

10. Eternal Wait
Over the Forgotten sea
Voice of angel is calling for me
Somewhere, where the mountains collide
That's where I'll find my new life

I have carried this burden so long for you
That nothing but sorrow I feel
I have let myself believe
That nothing would hurt deeper than the truth

Never has the wind blown like thousand years ago
Everything that I've known has left me on my own
Never have I felt the rain fall down like the burning flames
All I see is the face of eternal wait

I hear your silent cry
Lost in the rainy night
No reason to live for
One reason to die for

I am the one who has fallen into the path of shadows
(and that road never seems to end)
I am the one who has drowned into the river of tears

11. Battle Song
Let's go

Hear the sound of swords fulfill the night
Feel the winds of death on your skin
See the arrows fly, flaming in the sky
Hear the screams of men, as they die

We won this battle wit might and fearless hearts
We came and we fulfilled our prophecy
So now we shall march back towards our kingdom
With heads up high and glimmering eyes
We returned with our glory

Silence now falls upon this blood red field
Vultures feasting with the flesh of dead bodies
"This is a great moment for all of us
But now it's time to head back home victorious"

12. Guardians Of Fate
Race with the wind
The night is ending
They will win
When the sun is rising
Stories have been told for years about the rebel man
Riding in the lands of unknown
No one has ever seen their furious beings
And their secret remains untold

Their deeds shall be heard
Their legend will live forever
They are the Guardians Of Fate

As they shouted their last battle cries their destiny was to be dead
Their future was in no one's hands like the prophet of the moon had said

Those who travelled far away from home, they'll never return
And those who crossed the seas of hope, they all will burn

3. Token Of Time
Harvest the field of time
with the old man's scythe
The narrow path of the chosen one
reaches beyond life

I set sails for the ageless winds
No fear of dying or a thought of surrender
I threaten every barrier on my way
I am bound forever with Token of Time

Among the humble people
Everything is torn apart
but I'm blessed with faith
and bravely I shall go on

Are thou the bringer of hope and joy
that I've waited for years
I shall fight to restore the moon
Wisdoms of time are carved on the sacred wood

Do thou possess spiritual powers
that would dispel all my fears
I shall not die until the seal is broken
Token of Time is trusted in the hands of the chosen one

5. Old Man
So much farther off than time could reach
Today it would be too late
So much despair he has bled
but will he wither away
No one knows that you must keep
this Old Man wide awake
'cause no one knows that he could feed
our lives with a brighter flame

[CHORUS 1:]
Hush little dreamer, the bearer of light
has come to set you free
Now little dreamer at last you can sigh
'cause the nightmares will be released

[CHORUS 2:]
Sweeter far than life from I found that love was
Sweeter far than love to die as he did
[J.L.Runeberg]

[REPEAT CHORUS 1]

The stars fell from the night sky
as he reached his hands in the air
As the sun peeked between the trees
the Old Man burst to tears

[REPEAT CHORUS 2]

6. Little Dreamer
Once there was a boy back in time of the heathens
Day after day he just kept dreaming things that would make him weaker
His father could not make him see, that there is more than dreams
But he wouldn't listen to the words of his father, 'cause he's a little dreamer

Along his quest for solitude
A wise man came and told him to follow the stars

He ran to the forest with whirlwinds by his side
He's lost in this world of lies
Take him back where rivers flow upwards
He is the one who lives
under a moonless sky looking for time
Take him back where stars are shining bright

Far in the lands of icetop mountains far on the other side
pictures are appearing so serenely into my mind
Far in the lands of meadows of fire deep in forgotten life
memories are drifting away so silently from light

Along his path of misery
A wise man came and told him to follow... the stars
Little Dreamer...

7. Abandoned
Sing for your tears
a song of the hatred
No one can hear
'cause your life is forgotten
I want to give my life to you
but my will is tied with puppet strings
I am fighting and screaming alone
inside this empty room
They let you down, threw you in the rain
They let you down, sent you away... without a name

The night is dark when you're alone
and sometimes it can be so cruel
The rain keeps falling on me so coldly
'cause your wishes didn't come true

Nothing seems real anymore
as I dive into the sea of lies
I don't understand this sorrow
that keeps me sane

8. Windrider
He appears from the mists of a dismal lake
and the sky crumbles as he flies through the dimensions alone
The night has laid a cape on his shoulders
and with a grin on his face he attacks with his loyal soldiers, into the unknown

There's no place for him in this world, and no ties
and all this hate and grief unite in his mind

Windrider - seeks freedom with vengeance on his mind
to escape from the crimson skygrave and fly away
Windrider - is waiting for the final day
when he'll be released from the shackles of a slave

In the eye of the storm he rides with jaded memories of his life
as the fires are dancing colorfully, he is struggling to survive
Trapped in a maze, can't get away, what have you became now
Take the hammer of the elders and crush your way out

His presence is shaking the land
as he stands at the mountain peak
His instincts are getting weak,
but there is still hunger in his eyes, that keeps him alive

He wears the mask of the hunted
Arts of light for him have been granted
He lives in the fragments of time
waiting for his time to die
...Windrider...

9. Treacherous Gods
The Land Is Silent... Before The Storm!

On the vast fields of snow, the wind is blowing strong
With its frozen cold and relentless touch
it leaves a dead and hollow land of ice

I have seen through the eyes of a wolf
and felt all its pain and loneliness
The beautiful land opened before my eyes
wild as a beast I ran into the night

The Calling Of The Howling Wind
Is Raging In The Realms Of North
Creations Of Ice Rising Mighty Into The Skies
And Treacherous Gods Shall Fall

Watching through the falling snow
there's no sign of life
The fire has gone out in the whirl of time
Behold the face of thunder
the storm is getting near
When the sky calls my name, I have no fear

They brought us misfortune, but their honor is about to be crushed
My blood flows cold as streams of the North
We'll never let them take our souls
The calling of the howling wind is raging in the North
Creations of ice, rising mighty into the skies
and Treacherous Gods shall fall

Time And Time Again
I Witness The Birth Of A New Born Star
I Climb The Highest Mountain
To Find The Essence Of A New Era

10. Eternal Wait
Over the Forgotten sea
Voice of angel is calling for me
Somewhere, where the mountains collide
That's where I'll find my new life

I have carried this burden so long for you
that nothing but sorrow I feel
I have let myself believe
that nothing would hurt deeper than the truth

Never has the wind blown like thousand years ago
Everything that I've known has left me on my own
Never have I felt the rain fall down like the burning flames
All I see is the face of eternal wait

I hear your silent cry
lost in the rainy night
No reason to live for
one reason to die for

I am the one who has fallen into the path of shadows
(and that road never seems to end)
I am the one who has drowned into the river of tears

11. Battle Song
Hear the sound of swords fulfill the night
Feel the winds of death on your skin
See the arrows fly, flaming in the sky
Hear the screams of men, as they die

We won this battle wit might and fearless hearts
We came and we fulfilled our prophecy
So now we shall march back towards our kingdom
With heads up high and glimmering eyes
we returned with our glory

Silence now falls upon this blood red field
Vultures feasting with the flesh of dead bodies
"This is a great moment for all of us
but now it's time to head back home victorious"

12. Goblins' Dance
Once in the time of chaos,
of sunless days and of unhappiness
The statue of the triumphant master
stood proud and grim
In the light of three descending moons,
it twisted and cracked open
Unleashing the Goblin King,
once again, for the last time

"Now the Victory is ours!"
"Let us dance the dance of Immortals"
They shrieked, as they marched
up and down the hills,
in the sighing face of earth

Misfortune and Chaos,
Grief and Destruction
The works of Dreaming evil,
and the joy of unholiness
No soul was left alone,
in the mayhem of the human race
"Hahahahaa!!!, Let us joy, Let us dance!!!"
So they danced their macabre dances

From the three ascending moons,
moonshine was spilling onto the ground,
Gruesome trophies were all around,
In the halls of the Goblin King

1. By The Dividing Stream

2. From Afar
A raven came to me,
Spoke to me in my dream.
A long lost prophecy,
A forgotten legacy.

Echoes of yesterday,
Won't let these dreams fade away.
All the beauty I adored,
At the edge of the world.

Across the universe,
Time is to be reversed.
No shelter can be found,
To this fate, we are bound!

Behold the final hour,
The last times will be dour.
All life falls into gorge
Of the end of the world!

"Burning skies
On the vengeance night.
Devastating scythe,
Of the ancient Light."

I saw the might,
Of the ancient Light!
And the beauty of the perishing world,
Theres no tomorrow.
We have been warned.

"The sky's bird struck fire,
Made a flame flare up.
The north wind burnt the clearing.
The north-east quite consumed it:
It burnt all the trees to ash and reduced them to dust."

3. Twilight Tavern
We heard that enemies were approaching from the south
We marched to face them, I killed their scout
But we were ambushed and slaughtered in the night
We fought so bravely but none were left alive

Now I open my eyes and what do I see
A rainbow in the moonlight, pipers calling me
They say don't be afraid and asked me to follow
You've been expected, so forget your sorrow!

[Chorus:]
Their warrior's souls forever rejoice
TWILIGHT TAVERN!
With our ancestors we raise our horns
TWILIGHT TAVERN!
Their warrior's swords forever shine on
TWILIGHT TAVERN!
Welcoming our brothers at the break of dawn!
TWILIGHT TAVERN!

[Bridge:]
Life is so short (Life is so short)
Oh! son of the north (Oh son of north)
You'll find your peace
At the end of your journey

[Solo]

[Verse:]
Hey! All greet us when we open the door
Familiar faces -- "Brothers, it's been too long"
Beer is flowing, the smell of burning meat
In the morning battle reigns like hell's been unleashed!

As the sun sets behind the mountains peak,
The master of the house shouts: "Drink and feast!"
This feels like it is too good to be true.
The call for the final battle will be here soon

[Chorus]

4. Heathen Throne
This hate inside me,
It is constantly growing.
Years of hollow lies,
Made pagan hatred rise.

They came with their troops,
Destroying land and roots.
Abominations under the sun,
They and their poisoned truth.

One by one my people fell,
Under their deceptive spell.
How many sons of the
Northe, had to fall?
Before our eyes could see;
This isn't how it should be!

"Under the Northern star
We shed our blood.
With the call of a battle horn.
We raise our swords.
Behind the fields of blood,
There's a haven for us.
Deep in the woods of the North,
Rises the Heathen Throne"
[Kalevala]

Upholder of the skies,
For too long has your name been
Despised,
Give us your strength and courage.
When we meet our nemesis.
On the shores that used to be,
The place we called home.

Our land and faith are raped,
Somehow they're going to pay.

Grant us your revenge,
We are not afraid of death.
Let none of them ever more, EVER MORE,
Lay a hopeful gaze upon the sky!

5. Elusive Reaches
Protector of the sun arrives with light
From the edge of the world to the highest heights.
With a thunder blast he greets his twin,
And falls back to oblivion.

From the western plains where nature blooms.
Roams the swift brother in eternal blue.
Chasing the vanishing golden light.
Hasting towards an endless night.

Across the high northern skies
The eldest brother in all his might.
Guards the frozen barren land
With a token of wisdom in his hand.

Forlorn moon and dreadful mist
The youngest brother raises his fist.
All life slowly withers away
And the infinite circle begins again.

The trail of the winds remains unseen,
For mortals their realm stays concealed.
The ageless skies that stand before our eyes,
When we'll be gone they'll still be flying free.

Silvery light of the sea,
Sparkles of far beneath.
Cold breeze against their brawn,
Reminds them of cold steel and war!

6. Stone Cold Metal
Howl of a coyote wakes up a man,
A haggard shadow in this wasted land.
Vultures rise with the scorching sun.
A dry wind blows in a silent town.

Some Whiskey to clear his head
And some for the brothers who are dead.
Another day, another chase,
Vigilantes will meet their fate.

Saddle your steed
We are riding tonight
Be ready to kill
Don't flee from a fight.
Pillaging is in our blood,
We bow to no one and no one at all!

Stone cold metal in his hand,
Stirs wild rival of righteous man.
Life of an outlaw; the gallows await.
Until then they shall reign!

No border is too sacred
To cross and to spill the cup of hatred.
Days to come are still unveiled,
Take whats yours, no time to bewail!

Waning daylight, time to move on
Under a looming crescent moon.
Another town, again to raze,
Surely someone will pass deaths gate.

In the silence of the night
Treacherous lady of the evening,
Deceived the whereabouts of marauders.

Ten bounty hunters are heading to the hideaway.
A dark red desert moon
Shimmers it gloomy light.
Upon a baneful affair of honour.

For a fleeting moment, eye meets eye.
Silent respect before an inevitable solution.
Dead or alive, Its all the same...

7. Smoking Ruins
For many years ago
He left his home behind.
No farewells or a note,
Like a thief he fled into the night.

Heart full of foolish pride,
He caused a death of his clans man
All prophesies he denied,
And now in exile he grieves.

Hear the call of the fallen ones
Wisdom of those whose time has gone
Live your life bravely my first born son,
On battlefields fight, don't run.

The wheel of time keeps turning
A boy becomes a man.
But still shame burns him.
At last he understands.

He heads back to his homeland.
He rides fast like a storm wind
But the flames in the horizon,
Tell there is only death to be found.

By the smoking ruins of his past life.
He raises his hand to the skies,
"Oh god of thunder,
God of my fathers,
Strike me down for what I've done!"

Above the darkened woods, blackened ravens sing.
As flows the people's blood, to melt these frozen grounds.
See how glows the sky, how curve the heavens above us.
It beckons, calling us, to the lands beyond the Dark Stream.
Those weakened, to the Darkest of Streams shall drown.
And when heroes, those riverbanks will reach.
The sounds of singing, across eternity shall echo.
Calling our brothers, to journey, afar, beyond the Dark Stream.

9. The Longest Journey (Heathen Throne Part II)
Could my ruin have come,
My day of trouble have arrived,
In these tuonele cabins
These abodes of the dead land?
[Kalevala]

Far beyond the dark stream pagan souls will
Roam those cold lands wild and free.
Wait for the sign; a blood red sky.
Then beyond the dark stream we will ride.

The path of mortals,
So narrow and brutal.
Only bravest of them all
Will find true valours

Decaying souls of men,
Who trust in false omens,
Will drown in the stream
With their untrue beliefs.

He's been drifting
For so long,
Searching for the land.
Where heroes roam.

In the horizon,
The last ray of light,
A breeze from the other side,
Before he dies.

Dividing walls of stone,
Eternal heathen Throne,
Beneath the cold starlight.
Revealed for the purest sight.

Through constant affliction
Towards alleviations,
When a searing star is near.
Carry on, you're almost here

Far beyond the dark stream we'll meet again.
Across the wilderness and we will be home.
Gather your strength, don't be afraid.
Far beyond the dark stream, we'll meet again.

The longest journey of them all,
Has to be made all alone
A flame in the skyline reaching the stars
Guiding the seeker through the night!

The wanderer has nowhere to go, when he arrived at the end.
The moon will stain all shades of blue, he is the only one left out there.
Far over there from a secluded courtyard, lit the heat into the night.
Raises hunger in his frozen body, which has lived on air and water.

[Chorus:]
It hurts, but go anyway, you can always go on.
It hurts, but go right, you are here and came here as a wanderer.

Bell rings for a lonely soul, it has borrowed the voice of death.
Does it hurt or want it well, when the count of our destiny.
Stop thinking it is difficult anyway, you may take one day at a time.
The wanderer has nowhere to go, if he goes at the end of the battle.

[Chorus]

1. Symbols
[Instrumental]
2. In My Sword I Trust
Many men have crossed my way
Promising peace and my soul to save
But I've already heard it all
I've seen what they made with their freedom
But I, I have no need for your god
The shallow truth of your poisonous tongue
Brothers, it's time to make a stand
To reclaim our lives
Because only steel can set us free

Rise my brothers, we are blessed by steel
In my sword I trust!
Arm yourselves, the truth shall be revealed
In my sword I trust!
Tyrants and cowards for metal you will kneel
In my sword I trust
'Til justice and reason will wield
In my sword I trust

The sword that shimmers in my hand,
Do you have the mind to eat the guilty flesh?
To drink the blood of those who are to blame?
The time of change is here, unveil your blade!

Rise my brothers we are blessed by steel
In my sword I trust
Arm yourselves the truth shall be revealed
In my sword I trust
Tyrants and cowards for metal you will kneel
In my sword I trust
'Til justice and reason will wield
In my sword I trust

Cling your souls to your gods
Kneel, obey, follow their laws
Deceit, subjugate, cherish their greed
Disdain verity, glorify futile faith

O Old Man,
Bring me a fiery fur coat
Put on me a blazing shirt
Shielded by which I may make war
Lest my head should come to grief
And my locks should go to waste
In the sport of bright iron
Upon the point of harsh steel
[Kalevala]

Rise my brothers we are blessed by steel
In my sword I trust
Arm yourselves the truth shall be revealed
In my sword I trust
Tyrants and cowards for metal you will kneel
In my sword I trust
'Til justice and reason will wield
In my sword I trust
In my sword I trust

3. Unsung Heroes
Forgotten tomb hill
Unnamed graves
No light can reach there
Memories fade away

Only frozen soil
And eternal wind
Remember the sacrifice
Of those who are now buried in time

A Dauntless heart
A Righteous mind
No sign of fear
Cast aside
Left to die
Just one frozen tear

Unsung heroes
Forgotten valour
Unknown soldiers
Entombed in time

Only shadows grow
Where the forsaken lie
Hope buried in snow

A thousand scars
Regret none
But only the dead ones
Have seen the end of war

4. Burning Leaves
Passing aeons
Everlasting fight against the Evil
Their army grows on and on
With the darkening horizon

I'm not afraid, let them come
I will never retreat
I will stand and hold my ground
Protect the ancient tree
The defense is doomed to fall
With the world I used to know

Burning leaves
Turn to ash before my eyes,
Crushed my dreams long gone.

Burning leaves
Dead branches reach to the sky,
The flame within me is gone.

On the light of the last dying star
Serpents crawl closer
All five branches, cursed from the start
And roots are torn to pieces
Right before my dying breath
I lay my eyes to the sky
As an eagle spreads its wings for the last time
Leaving me, the oak, the grove, to die

Burning leaves
Turn to ash before my eyes,
Crushed my dreams long gone.

Burning leaves
Dead branches reach to the sky,
The flame within me is gone.

Liekö enää päällä maan
Ainuttakaan joka muistaa
Lehdon tuon kauniin kaukaisen
Jonne tie vie jokainen
Kun kuolemaan vartija viimeinen
Keskellä liekkien ikuinen
Puu ja maailma ihmisten
Niin loppuu aikamme
[English translation:]
I wonder if any longer someone walks the Earth who recalls
That fair Grove afar, where all paths meet
As the last of the guardians falls, ablaze the
Eternal Tree and Domain of Man
Thus ends Our Time

5. Celestial Bond
A long time ago I went to the shore
I whispered my wish to a breeze from the North
The wind took the wish high to the stars
Told them what I've missed with all my heart

I was mesmerized by the rolling tide
I lay on that shore and gazed into the skies
Like a shooting star, my dream was gone
I made up my mind
I don't want to wake up

When will time heal and fulfil the dream of my heart?
When will we unite as one and light our own star?

All these memories I will treasure in my heart
Words are so vain
A bond beyond quintessence

For a thousand lifetimes
I will wait to feel
A passing moment of bliss
To be embraced by silence

6. Retribution Shall Be Mine
No sun rises today
No moon shares it's light
Eclipse of soul
Growing breach of faith

Pierced by bitter deception
Chained to the darkness
Left to rot
Growing breach of faith
Left to rot with hate

I can't escape from this living hell
But in my dreams the justice dwells
Betrayers are torn apart
And my hate will fade away with their blood

My hate runs deep
In the waters of grudge and unforgiveness

Leniency is for the weak
I'd rather die than show you mercy
Slaughter is yet to come

Retribution shall be mine!
Oh Gods of vengeance, fill my heart!

This is mine
The one and final fight
I choose not to die
With these demons by my side

7. Star Queen (Celestial Bond Part II)
The traveller's heart is meant to be free
No obligations and soul redeemed
I knew that part wasn't for me
When I met my star queen

Born in stars, like all of us
But can two paths start from one?
Unite again somewhere in time
And light the brightest star in the endless sky

Oh Queen of Stars
How long until
Oh Queen of Stars
Dreams are fulfilled?

Years go by I thought I could forget
I lived in a lie, that's all I regret
It's better for a man to die by the sword
Than wither away with undying love

I wish that the wind will play with her hair
Touch her lips, tell I'll be there
Longing for the moment for eternity
Light of a thousand stars will always comfort me

9. Last Breath
Lying on the ground
As battle rages on
Warm blood covers
The cold land of our fathers

Don't cry for me my son
Because I'm not the only one
Where I go you can't follow
This journey I will make all alone

I've bled so many times for this land
But this wound will claim my life
Death commands me to give my hand

Let not my people
Live under oppression
And remember the darker the night
The more beautiful is the morning's light

Fear no more
Just let go
Adore this world
Once more
The truth unfolds
In the Ancient Halls
Fear no more
Just let go

There is no shimmer of the light
In this pouring rain
I close my eyes
Has it all been in vain?

10. Passion, Proof, Power
Where to find the truth?
Questions linger through time
Unbreakable will and inquiring mind
Have always been the seeker's guide

The Reason as my sword
The Knowledge as my shield
I'll face my foes again and again
On the ancient battlefield

I can't deny what I've seen
So towards the great unknown
I must keep going on

Stop your quest
Or with fire you'll be cleansed
Confess...
Death...

Woe to the faith
Through dark centuries
The wait for the time
When all is revealed

Unbreakable
Stands through time
Dwells the proof of life
Eternal Earth of mine

Cleanse our souls
No good thoughts shall burn
Engulf the passion of life
Eternal Fire of mine

Carry it on
The ancient wisdom of mankind
Eternal Air of mine

Renew us within
Wash away
The remains of lies
Eternal Water of mine

Indivisible
Beyond death and life
The answer divine
Eternal Elements of mine

The gatekeeper of the knowledge
The One who was trusted the secrets of time and space once said:
To know is your destination
To find is your possibility
And to search is your quest.

Your path has merged with the truth.
But yet you refuse to see it
It's easier to be afraid, to be deceived, to be a sheep
Be aware, question them, question yourself
Because once you see it, you can never look away

Every man's
Horizon can change
But eternal skies
Will always stay the same

Like a new sun arises from winter's cold and dark grave, it's unstoppable.

Keep your twisted beliefs
Sons and Daughters of Dawn are calling me

The fire that burns my flesh
Shall light up the words I've said
The curse on my innocent name
Shall put all of you in shame

Woe to the man
Who disheartens the few
Who reach for the light
Who searches for the truth

I only have just one more wish
That this torch will be passed onto someone sentient like you
When your time comes, don't lose your heart
Have faith and patience and trust in the flame before passing it onto someone new

The greatest power of all
Will force their gods to fall
The greatest power of all
Embrace, illuminate all!

I am, you are, no one's slave
No man or god they have made

1. Ad Victoriam
[Instrumental]

2. Blood Is The Price Of Glory
Before the grimmest enemy
Cold rain whipping those proud faces
Warcries raising their spirits
Despising death as they rush forward
Blood of the brothers drains to the ground
Stirring up rage, giving the power
Trampling the enemy with their feet
Without fear they fight

Can you hear the call of the North star
Feel its longing in your heart
This bound is eternal
Sworn through blood
At the end we will stand as one!
Even if the daylight dies
Our horde marches on and on
If we should fall down to the ground
We'll rise again and never give up!

But for some it's all too much
This honorable battle and bloodshed
They flee like a swarm of craven rats
Leaving their brothers to a certain death
The last furious men
They didn't fear death or pain
They held up their swords and shields
As winners they stood on the battlefield

Can you hear the call of the North star
Feel its longing in your heart
This bound is eternal
Sworn through blood
At the end we will stand as one!
Even if the daylight dies
Our horde marches on and on
If we should fall down to the ground
We'll rise again and never give up!

Run away you cowards
We turn our backs on you
The shame that now stains your name
Will only brighten our glory
Those who fight till their last breath
And fall with honour
Their names and deeds shall live forever
Never to be forgotten

No axe stayed in your weak hand
No shield protected you from the blows of enemies
Get out of our sight
The war has no need for traitors

Can you hear the call of the North star
Feel its longing in your heart
This bound is eternal
Sworn through blood
At the end we will stand as one!
Even if the daylight dies
Our horde marches on and on
If we should fall down to the ground
We'll rise again and never give up!

3. Deathbringer From The Sky
High above the ground
Beyond the thunderclouds
A Black shade is flying alone
Once so feared among men
Now the legend is becoming too old
But finally the horrifying truth is about to unfold

Deathbringer from the Sky
Hunting victims in the night
Feel the terror as flames are burning bright
There is... No tower as high or a cave so deep
That can save you from its endless spite
So bow down and face your wretched destiny

A Den filled with treasures and gold
No longer calms his spirit so cold
Again it is time to spread the wings of doom
A Growl shakes the ground
Flames blind men and smoke covers the stars
As he rises towards an ancient sky

The era of total chaos will arrive
Men shall flee in fear
My name will haunt their mortal souls
I'll burn their flesh and I'll crush their bones

Now they shall know
That every myth told is true
They shall burn on my blazing gallows

Deathbringer from the Sky
Hunting victims in the night
Feel the terror as flames are burning bright
There is... No tower as high or a cave so deep
That can save you from its endless spite
So bow down and face your wretched destiny

Your screams can't make me feel pity or regret
I only feel furious hatred
With fire my dominion is gained
So burn away and let my kind rule the world again

4. Ahti
At the time of sundown
Nature bathes in colours
In silence it waits
For the approaching force
In the halls of Ainola
The true king of dark waters
Lurks with his mistress
And a mob of a sea creatures

Under the waves of a blue lake
Dwells the mighty AHTI!
Sailors praise the glorious name
Of the ruler of tides; AHTI!

At the shores of a northern land
Pray mortal men
Destruction for the arrogant fools
A Reward for humble souls
The great lurker of the seas
Is pleased of the sacrifice
The waters are calm
Today no storm shall rise!

Under the waves of a blue lake
Dwells the mighty AHTI!
Sailors praise the glorious name
Of the ruler of tides; AHTI!

Under the waves of a blue lake
Dwells the mighty AHTI!
Sailors praise the glorious name
Of the ruler of tides; AHTI!

Foreign ship filled with infidels
They didn't listen to the northern men
From a dead calm storm will rise
And they'll face the wrath of the sea
Take care that your heir
Don't turn out too proud
Or your bloodline will drown
Into a vast ocean...

Under the waves of a blue lake
Dwells the mighty AHTI!
Sailors praise the glorious name
Of the ruler of tides; AHTI!

Under the waves of a blue lake
Dwells the mighty AHTI!
Sailors praise the glorious name
Of the ruler of tides; AHTI!

5. One More Magic Potion
Once when we were returning from a battle and
We got lost in a gloomy forest
in the middle of the woods
we saw an old house
with tired minds we knocked
the door very loudly
Old woman opened the wooden door
She asked us to come in
with kind words
From her pot arose a scent so weird
Stunning and bitter but very summoning

Bring me a magic potion
it will heal my aching wounds
A taste so bitter that makes
my bleeding soul feel so good
It will make us sing and dance
in our endless feast
Or it might even unleash
the beast in me

She filled out pints with that devils beverage
And served another round with an hideous grin
The world was spinning in a new light I saw everything
and everyone was singing this song

With nature, trolls and the spirits of the forest
We are one; let our singing rise up into the stars
The witch's magic drum was still beating hard
When a goblin brought me a new pint and together we roared

Drink and dance!
People of the forest sing with us!
Who wants to brawl with me?
Who can shape a kantele from a pike's jaw?
Like the great one once did

Close your eyes
Calm your mind and drift away from the pain
Beyond dreams
Into the depths of the cauldron
Like a rain it falls
And mirrors nature's healing powers
Surrender this time
And relief you shall find

Catcher of souls
hunter of spirits
Grant us the final frop of the life's elixir
I want to drown all my misery
Into the green trolls blood
And brown swamp drink
Fight against diminishing time
Burden of a solitary warrior's life
Catcher of souls
hunter of spirits
Grant us the final frop of the life's elixir

Bring me a magic potion
it will heal my aching wounds
A taste so bitter that makes
my bleeding soul feel so good
It will make us sing and dance
in our endless feast
Or it might even unleash
the beast in me

6. Wanderer
In time bleeding wounds will heal
Unlike some which are too deep to see
Like scars in a nomads soul
Their mending is so slow
Not the shout of a hundred enemies
Can make him feel fear inside him
But when sun sets and the cold arrives
With crushing solitude in the darkness of night

He will ride across land and time
To find a way through this endless night
There's a storm in his heart and the fire burns his soul
But the wanderer's part is to ride alone

With bare hands he has taken many lives
He has had a hundred women by his side
From enchanted woods to the freezing north
He is known at every sea and far beyond
As the moon grows and the circle is complete
He lies down and waits for sleep
But there's always a scenery in his mind
Of all that beauty he once left behind

He will ride across land and time
To find a way through this endless night
There's a storm in his heart and the fire burns his soul
But the wanderer's part is to ride alone

He will ride across land and time
To find a way through this endless night
There's a storm in his heart and the fire burns his soul
But the wanderer's part is to ride alone

He will ride across land and time
To find a way through this endless night
There's a storm in his heart and the fire burns his soul
But the wanderer's part is to ride alone

7. Raised By The Swords
Oh, who is raised by the sword
Can't be beaten
Who is toughened by the fire
Can't be burned
Awaited by immortality
Are the ones sacrificing their lives
To blood, to victory, to the truth

As ye saw, as shall ye reap
We will turn your fields into death
Shining our blades smash all down
Guidance of cold winds
We complete the ancient rule
Each of us was created to kill

Hail, the wisest ones
You have walked the severe and harsh path
To the almighty crown
Soon the lost riddles will be solved
Once and for all
As the ageless earth praises your sword

As ye saw, as shall ye reap
We will turn your fields into death
Shining our blades smash all down
Guidance of cold winds
We complete the ancient rule
Each of us was created to kill

Oh, raise the wind
Oh, open up earth
Oh, wild waters flood
And flames burn the ruins they own
Burn all and everything they own

Now let your prayers fade
The weak ones will meet their gruesome fate
Loyal minds will not break
The bold people of war
Have raised to get their victory
You depend on our mercy
Who is raised by the sword
Can't be beaten
Who is toughened by the fire
Can't be burned
Our everlasting loyalty will never break
The bold people of war
Have raised their swords

8. The New Dawn
Through the storm like the wind we ride
Leaving it all far behind
Another war is straight ahead
This fight will give us all
None shall live , they all will fall
When the new dawn arises, we stand tall

Fight! For our new dawn
Ride! Kill them all
Fight! For our new dawn
Rise! And we stand tall

Feel your strength and let it rise
Hear the call of their demise
Let them feel your steel
Have faith my friend, this is not the end
Our time is near, we feel your fear
Because we will...

Fight! For our new dawn
Ride! Kill them all
Fight! For our new dawn
Rise! And we stand tall

Nothing can stop us now
As we march towards the final fight
It waits us in the night
Our swords are taking lives
Giving us what is ours
Now the new dawn arises and we have it all

Fight! For our new dawn
Ride! Kill them all
Fight! For our new dawn
Rise! And we stand tall

9. Victory Song
The plan of invasion
an Evil deception
Was made in the halls of the dark kingdom
To steal their riches
To slave them all
To make them kneel for a new God

The Guard woke up the sleeping men
With the sound of a bronze horn
The enemy is getting closer
So brace yourselves for assault!

Swords in their hands they killed each and every man
Who dared to invade their sacred land
Victory songs are raising in the night
Telling all of their undying strength and might

Arrows are raining from the sky
As brothers fight side by side
We're outnumbered
But our destiny is to win

FIGHT!
Fight with the rage of a bear!
DEFEND!
Our homeland!
CRUSH!
Crush every enemy!
AND SEAL!
Our victory!

Swords in their hands they killed each and every man
Who dared to invade their sacred land
Victory songs are raising in the night
Telling all of their undying strength and might

The braves of the north
Didn't give in before the threat
Again the sky dome rumbles
Blood stains the snow
Many don't get to see tomorrow
Many will be missed
Land remains peaceful for progeny
Songs of victory will sound forever)

Swords in their hands they killed each and every man
Who dared to invade their sacred land
Victory songs are raising in the night
Telling all of their undying strength and might

Swords in their hands they killed each and every man
Who dared to invade their sacred land
Victory songs are raising in the night
Telling all of their undying strength and might

10. Lady In Black
[originally by Uriah Heep]She came to me one morning
One lonely Sunday morning
Her long hair flowing
In the midwinter wind
I know not how she found me
For in darkness I was walking
And destruction lay around me
From a fight I could not win
Ah ah ah...

She asked me name my foe then
I said the need within some men
To fight and kill their brothers
Without thought of love or God
And I begged her give me horses
To trample down my enemy
So eager was my passion
To devour this waste of life
Ah ah ah...

But she wouldn't think of battle that
Reduces men to animals
So easy to begin
And yet impossible to end
For she's the mother of all men
Had counselled me so wisely then
I feared to walk alone again
And asked if she would stay
Ah ah ah...

Oh lady lend your hand I cried
And let me rest here at your side
Have faith and trust
In me she said
And filled my heart with life
There is no strength in numbers
Have no such misconception
But when you need me
Be assured I won't be far away
Ah ah ah...

Thus having spoke she turned away
And though I found no words to say
I stood and watched until I saw
Her black cloak disappear
My labor is no easier
But now I know I'm not alone
I find new heart each time
I think upon that windy day
And if one day she comes to you
Drink deeply from her words so wise
Take courage from her
As your prize
And say hello from me
Ah ah ah...

1. Dragonheads
Sails up! We're leaving today
Distant lands are calling
Cowards stay at home; this is a quest of true men
Farewell, should we never see again

Weeping women waving at the pier
When the sky starts to cry
But neither rain, nor wind can make us turn around
What's decided, has to be done

See how the forefathers greet, us with northern lights
Bravely towards unknown shores, through raging storms we fight
Faith in the gods, their strength in our hearts, when lightning strikes
If we die, we'll meet again in Valhalla...

In a dream I saw two ravens in the sky
And a verdant land behind
When we set out feet there, we'll burn our fleet
'Cause the land is promised to us by gods

May Njord protect us on our way
May the moon light our path
Let our spirits be purified by the ocean's breeze
Let the wind, tell our legend which ever lasts

When we reach the open sea, leaving our home behind
The Dragonheads are rising, let the stars be our guides

See how the forefathers greet, us with northern lights
Bravely towards unknown shores, through raging storms we fight
Faith in the gods, their strength in our hearts, when lightning strikes
If we die the sun will shine again beyond mortal time
We'll meet again in Valhalla!

2. Warrior's Quest
Strike with powers of magic stone
Grab your legacy that you behold
If you can find your destiny
Then you may return back to your home

...Ride away with your mighty horse
Ride away through the land of storms...
Unknown are the ways of your journey ahead
But with strength and courage you can avoid your death

Throw your sword through the memories
Embracing your bleeding heart
Don't follow the shadows they ain't for real
Like the guiding stars

As he falls to eternity the truth is fading
Part of him died long time ago but still there's death awaiting

Go now brave warrior don't look back
The stars will guide you through the night
But even the brightest light,
Won't reach into the darkest night...

3. Kalevala Melody
[Instrumental]

4. White Storm
On this magical dawn the colours of the autumn are reflected by a light
A light that has been captured for years in oblivion of time

Circles of time are raging now
And so his powers are slowly dying
Before the coldness rapes the lands
His spirit is wandering into the night... to die!

...And he heard chimes ahead playing these enchanted notes,
That lead him into a wooden cabin, where he could rest for the night...

Over the mountains
He had traveled
Across the oceans
Deep in the night
Now when it's time to
Say last farewells
Show us your power
Show us your might

His eyes can see it so clearly now
But his restless mind cannot sense it in the air
The white storm is close!

...And his powers gained in this mystical place more than he ever possessed before.
So now he could rule the realms of ice... Once again!

Over the mountains
He had traveled
Across the oceans
Deep in the night
Now when it's time to
Say last farewells
Show us your power
Gift from the sky

5. Into Hiding
[Amorphis cover]

The islander slips into hiding
And takes to his heels
Out of dark Northland
The murky house of Sara
He whirled out of doors as snow
Arrives as smoke in the yard
To flee from bad deeds

There he had to become someone else
He must change his shape
As an eagle he swept up
Wanted to soar heavenward
The sun burnt his cheeks
The moon lit his brows

The tree is blooming on the fields of Karelia
The Karelian birches are getting thicker
Your cockoo is cockooing and it is spring
Take my endless yearning there.

I feel your danger and your' mountain range.
and the smoke of your burnt land and your sleeping nights
and the primeval trees of your forest
and your looming inlets and the mounths of the fjords.

My journey is oft there without a goal
through forests went, bushes
I stood with a bare head on the hills
where I saw the beautiful Karelia ahead of me

Hello, forest, hello, mountain
Hello, the prince of the forest
Here is a noble boy, young
He comes forward, full of power
as the severe wind of the field

I want to be a son of the forest
hero of the gloomy spruce copse
on the fields of Tapiola
I wrestle with the bear
And the world shall be forgotten

The peace is here wonderful
Brave is the fighting
Storm is coming and forest thunders
The fire strikes long
and a spruce falls down loudly

1. March Of War
[Instrumental]
2. Axe Of Judgment
Patience is a virtue when you live for revenge
Hide your weapons, veil your hate, seek your foes unguarded and slay them!

Slay them!
Behead them!
Oh sweet revenge!
Behold, the axe of judgement falls!
This is war!
So make them suffer!

I share no thought for the dark depths where fate made me dwell
My hate has shaped me to perfection
A ruthless executioner

Remember this hate
Was the only thought in my head
When I woke up wounded on the ground
Stabbed in the back
A coward's attack
Curse you!
This means war!

If I would believe in soul
I would slaughter yours
But fear and agony in your eyes
Will have to do

When the axe of judgement falls
The vindictive one stands tall

3. Heathen Horde
Too many times has moon travelled across the sky,
Since our fathers sailed out for glory and honour,
It's time to fulfill the vow once given,
Forge your plows to swords, send the word,
Raise an army countless as stars in the sky.

[Chorus:]
All heathen hearts,
Answer the call,
God of thunder bless our swords,
Our heathen horde,
Will never fall,
We are hungry for blood, steel and war.

Filled with strength, valour, determination,
Determined to conquer the land,
There is no power,
In their weak invocation,
Puny invocations to their feeble god,
Desecrate and drown it in their blood.

"A coward believes he will ever live
If he keep him safe from strife:
But old age leaves him not long in peace
Though spears may spare his life.

Row!
Storm is getting near,
Row!
I can see land ahead,
No!
Show no mercy for the weak,
Gold, land and women are ours to take so kill!

[Chorus]

4. One Man Army
This lifeless soil
Barren of good thoughts
Scorched by grudge and grief
Doomed to linger on
Wandered aimlessly
Blinded by their lies
Now I raise my head and sword
When shadows steal the light

Fire
Desire
Denial
Burning
Yearning
Discerning

Fire
Desire
Denial
In my heart
Burning
Yearning
Discerning
I see it now

You call it cruelty
I call it strength
I am cursed to be
A one man army
You call me inhumane
I call this life regained
I am blessed to be
A one man army

I will take the lives, lives of my enemies
Yet still this battle feels like a defeat to me
Death or victory, only emptiness I feel
The spring of hope runs dry
Because I'm already dead inside

[Solo]

I will take the lives, lives of my enemies
Yet still this battle feels like a defeat to me

Death or victory

Fire
Desire
Denial
Burning
Yearning
Discerning

Fire
Desire
Denial
In my heart
Burning
Yearning
Discerning
I see it now

You call it cruelty
I call it strength
I am cursed to be
A one man army
You call me inhumane
I call this life regained
I am blessed to be
A one man army

One man army

5. Burden Of The Fallen
Nightmares return again.
There's no way to make amends.
His heart and the battlefield
Are alike, silent and empty.

6. Warrior Without A War
Only change is unavoidable,
A brave new chapter is getting closer [again],
Without a shroud of doubt he walked
The road so long. One dream, now gone.

What are you more afraid to find:
Something to live or something to die for?
In the end, how will you fall:
As a hero or a warrior without a war?

Why you withhold the pain but need those scars?
How will you leave to the unknown shores?
As a hero or a warrior without a war?
As a hero or a warrior without a war?

The one who is now forgotten
Carries the weight of a mountain.
No one can see how solemn
Is the burden of the fallen.

Memories, ruthless like old guilt.
Choices, accept or be haunted [since die].
No past, no future means a thing.
The very moment is all there is.

What are you more afraid to find:
Something to live or something to die for?
In the end, how will you fall:
As a hero or a warrior without a war?
As a hero or a warrior without a war?

Is it courage to let go or drown with a sword?
How will you face your final dawn?
As a hero or a warrior without a war?

The one who is now forgotten
Carries the weight of a mountain.
No one can see how solemn
Is the burden of the fallen.

7. Cry For The Earth Bounds
The cry for the earth bounds
Who'll face the final sundown

On the last shore of this dying world
A man, a symbol, a sword
A vague memory of something that was
But the moment takes its grasp

Horizon so calm
Harbinger of doom
Sets the sky ablaze
Torn apart by the whirl of time
Slowly, grimly all is devoured by night

Through the night we ride
Till the edge of time
Comforting death
Under the crumbling sky

Your fights
Are over now
Lay down and sleep
Gone are
All hate and love
For eternity

No eyes to see
When the last light that dwindles
Fades to nothingness
No souls to save
In the endless darkness
No hope, no forgiveness

8. Two Of Spades
I go all the way
Night and day
Women, booze and money
It's all just a game

Hit and run
That's how I play
All or nothing
That's the winner's way

When I woke up this morning
Everything was clear
Besides my head
Who's the lady in my bed?

I'll shoot the moon
Nice girls won't tell
Thanks for nothing
I'll be on my way to hell

Sweet lady luck on my side
I got ace in the sleeve
Dead man's hand
I'm armed to my teeth

There is no trick in the book
That I wouldn't know
Cross me and feel
The embrace of the rope

I'm a high roller
Gambling my life every single day
I'm not a poser
Because the card of my life is two of spades

"If I may die today,
To my ancestors, beyond time
In front of me stands the gates of Valhalla
In my hand well played cards of life."]

9. My Ancestors' Blood (Heathen Throne Part III)
Not just for victory,
Not just to crush your enemy,
Not just for heir to be,
But for this moment and to fight the injustice...

It was written long ago,
This is what I've been told,
An army came across the sea
To conquer this low land.

They lured with their lies,
Shouted, "Peasant, kneel or die!"
Outnumbered, undaunted,
War cry rose to the skies.

On the homeland of the raven,
Where the eagles scream at daybreak,
And the clang and clash of armies,
Beautiful the strife for conquest.

[Chorus:]
Rains came over to the north,
Flood of lies to drown the old gods,
A storm rose within the hearts of the enslaved,
Ode for my ancestors' blood.

The seer foresaw the curse from above,
Like a roar of approaching giant horde,
In the moors and in the marshes,
On the borders of the woodlands,
They marched like approaching giant horde.

When I yield my life forever,
Bravely will I fall in battle,
Fall upon the field of glory,
Beautiful to die in armour.

[Chorus]

10. Descendants, Defiance, Domination
The darkest hour, the hopeless time
Is always before the rise of the dawn
Find your courage to stand against a stream
The fairest they speak when the falsest they think

When mouths of men speak the words of gods
The truth will never be enough for anyone
When you reach the peak of the highest mountain
Proudly plant the flag of the heathen defiance

From the ashes of the ancient blood and wisdom
The children of thunder will rise again

Wielded lashes, pyres aflame, gloomy gallows
Tormented ones, brave and free
Screams echo in time

Not one unjust deed goes unpunished
No blood is shed in vain under the reborn thunder sign

I know we will
Claim the throne and kill
They asked for war so we will give them one

The one to end it all
Reckoning with blood
Stop the madness that's gone on for centuries

In a storm of obloquy, my sons stand strong
Marshall the forces, gather up weapons for the last war to come

Who is so righteous, uncorrupted to condemn and dominate
With truth and not with illusions
Not driven by the greed to be enthroned and rule?
Havoc no more
The reign of man

I have seen
How moon and stars glimmer
Over the waves far away

Sometimes wanderer may forget
How home land keeps on waiting
The one who is returning from far away

With the wings of longing
I fly across a distant land
To where my heart always desires to return

In front of storm clouds
In front of battles of life
In my heart I'll always be
Lady of the North

When I left
Tears of sorrow didn't flow
When I came back
I saw that something had changed

The path of a drifter
Wasn't real
But only longing and dreams

12. Candour And Lies
I, I have sailed
All alone
So many times
The seven seas of tears
I can still hear the waves.

Cold frigid wind
On my sails
Always takes me back
To distant memories
Home, the last farewell.

Waves of time
Candour and lies
for what I left behind,
I know the price was high.

No tears to cry
No words to make it right
But now I know that home is
Where my heart desires.

I, I was lost
No star
No shore to call my own
But I didn't know
I had it all.

On the fields of victories
And defeats
A drifter's life is both
longing and dreams
then reality.

Wasted time,
Candour and lies,
For what I left behind,
I know the price was high.
[x2]

No tears to cry,
No words to make it right,
But now I know that home is
Where my heart desires.

Behold how travels the wind
Hear how runs the time
Beneath the eternal star dotted sky
Will grow a vast power
In the glow of northern lights
Rises the sword of the victor

2. For Those About To Fight For Metal
Outnumbered but never alone, we stand
Brave warriors, axes in our hands
The symbol of enlightenment
The secret of steel
Carved in the hearts of the free

Forged in eternal fire
Harden in the frozen rain
There is something stronger than mortal flesh
That unites us as one

For those about to fight for metal;
Gods of war salute you all
For those who'll never lower their blade;
We're blood brothers 'til the end

The sound of archaic battle horns
Releases the beast within us all
Join us to fight for the metal dawn
Or one by one, you will fall

Let me hear your battle cry!
Raise your swords up high!

3. Way Of The Warrior
Staring into dying flames
Moon as my only guard
It's too late to hesitate
Only the weak suffer in this life

It's the way of the warrior
This path before me
Destined to be the king
Of battlefields

It's the eve of the bloodshed:
Women and mead!
From the skulls of my foes
Tomorrow, I'll drink

I shall honour my blade
With deeds, not with hollow words
Men will kneel when they hear my name
Before I laugh and rip out their wretched hearts

There are warriors with broadswords
Heroes clad in mail of copper
Are on beer intoxicated
By the beer are much embittered

4. Two Paths
Callow dreams
Dawn of spring
No seeds of doubt yet sown in the ground
Man-made shades mould reality
Looming deceptions
Hope blurs it all

The path so bright
The path so dark
All crossroads
Illusions of our lives

No, feel no pity for a dying man
We're all just here to die, to live one precious life
None for all and all for none
It's the only law
Feed you inner wolves
With prudence

When the night closes in
It grants us the final wish
The blade may be rusty and dull
But the spirit will never bend
Unforgiving, benevolent, brave, noble and foolish
All will dim with the last exhale
Then all will be complete

Every deed has a price to pay
May sagacity and chaos bless your way

5. King Of Storms
Who dares to stare death in the eye?
And face the maelstrom of doom like a hero?
When light splits the sky
And like a thousand giants, thunder roars

King of storms
Descends from the skies
Before my eyes
Destroyer of worlds
King of storms

I will rule with fear and pain
Your world will burn in dragon flame

You will
Obey
Your kin
Will yield when I say

Your dreams
Your fears
Your dying screams
Belong to me

Descry the beast of the nightmare realm
Destruction of all, humanity abhorred
Ravaged land where the afflicted dwell
The frozen void entombs idle prayers and exhorts

6. Feast With Valkyries
Through mist we ride
Howling wolves in moonlight
Blood has been shed tonight
It's judgement time

Gallantly you fought
Made your people proud
Rise brave warriors
The journey has just begun

High to the skies
Across the seas,
Woods of the north
And mountain peaks

The song will sound
Through history
Tonight we'll feast with Valkyries

Sons of frost and steel, reinvigorate
Stay humble not brash
Because I'm the one who chooses the slain

North wind in my hair
Only me, my steed and my spear
Charge to another battlefield
Eternal chant in the air

7. Don't You Say
From town to town I roam and dwell
Sing my songs and stories I tell
Gone is the gold and ladies' smile
I'm living on borrowed time

This is me, no guilt, no shame
I ain't no saint, I ain't no king
I'm a man of my word
With a stone backbone
Open your arms
I'm coming home

Don't you say it's the same old story
Don't you say I came too late
Don't you say it was all for nothing
For now I am here to stay
This promise will never fade away

I have a will, hard as a rock
But it crumbled down with the very last drop
Don't ask so I don't have to lie
I'm a rover 'til the day I die

8. I Will Never Kneel
Winds are calling me
The cold breeze of death
From the dividing stream
The clarity of what lies ahead

Your fortune will never change
Is what blind weaklings say
But I will not rest before the day
Every peasant is crowned as his own king

I will never kneel
Before your false beliefs
By my heathen blood
I will not give up

In my chest shines a glimmer as dark as the heart of the night
I will never forgive nor forget
The grudge, haunting, dead weight,
I will never forgive and forget… never

My love, where have you gone?
So cold, what have they done?
I can't see you, the world drowns in tears
I will forgive you, become the righteous hate and never forget
All is lost now, what once was a dream
Will never be seen
Spill their blood, revenge for both of us
And for all that will never be…

9. God Is Dead
Bring out your dead
I shout again
Will this ever end?
Rotting corpses everywhere
But I knew how to transcend

Round and round, the bottle goes
Drown, drown all hope and sorrow

Mad men on the streets
Keep herding their sheep
High or low, we're all gonna go
Down at least for six feet

Like thunder in a pint
Divine truth I will find
Lifelong misery
It is not out destiny

Joy to the world, god is dead
So let's drink until the bitter end

They whip you with their made-up sins
They beat you until you finally give in
But know that there is another path
Filled with joy and not the grandeur of misery
Wake up and see
Drink with me
In our wanton harmony

10. Hail To The Victor
Scareless man
Mangled soul of a solitary
Some fights
That are fought in the mind are not imaginary

Blazing eyes
Although the road has been long
All chains
Ignorance and hate…no more

Time is the dividend on ephemeral paths
Longing of the fulfillment is carved in wolven hearts
All those, in the end, will merge in to one

These times
These lives
In the hands of beasts of lies
Man made gods
Turning tides
Unknown future, no hope in sight

Foul beings
The ultimate sin
Like fools, they charge to kill their kin

The legend tells
In the hearts of men
Is the way, the power, to rise above this hell

Hail to the victor!
Once a castaway
But never astray
In the mirror we'll see the face
Of the only god whom should be praised

1. Slaget I Skogen Bortenfor (Epilog / Slaget)
Strokes from oars could be heard,
beautiful ships gushed through the sea
Like a wind from the north,
our ancestors reached the shore
Men from Hordaland, Rogaland and Adger
gathered for battle in common
Proud men with no fear
Strokes from the sword crushed the skull of the christian

A long time we ruled, kings of the north
Many battles we won, at the shores of Midgard
But, betrayed by our own brothers
we were forced down on our knees
Now when the wind once again is howling
the thoughts finally goes towards home
We shall rise in our glory
The white horde will for sure shiver

"We died like men
Therefore we never vanished
Weak is the one the enemy loves
Never betray your origin"

1. Frost
[instrumental]

2. Loke
Laughter echoes through the night
The evening star shines over Midgard
Evil mingles in the dark
The organised cosmos' enemy comes forth

Loke, the son of Fårbaute.. father of lies
Born of earth, unbound by laws

Takk weeps no heavy tears
For the loss of the sun's handsome son
But the mare in the woods submits
For the regaining of Foster brother's favour

Loke, the son of Fårbaute.. father of lies
Born of earth, unbound by laws

The salmon glides in the waterfall
The eagle sails with the wind
Hammer groans in Jotun scull
The under ground spurts fire

Laughter, deceit, beauty and contempt
The old norse god's protector and leader of Jotuns

3. Fenris
Glem alle lover, all orden og fred
Kaos er allt; ingen tid eller sted
Nå når alt lys og liv tar slutt
Når vinden nå dreper;
Lenkene er brutt!

Tiden er kommet
som nornene forutså
intet varer evig
slaget på Vigrid skal stå
det finnes ingen brødre
det finnes ingen sterke band
Det brundne raseri er løs
indre kulde er fri
en elv av fråde
er tørket ut
Ulvens kraft, det dunkle hat
Ser ikke lenger en grense
Ty. Din hånd for fred du gav
Men de siste sår kan fred ei lindre

Angrboda med rette
bar sitt navn
med Lauvøus sønn hun alvet frem
angst, hat og død
et varselskrik I mørket
bergets røtter, Bjørnesner
Kvinneskjegg, kattetrinns lyd
pust fra fisken , fuglens spytt
temmede krefter fra svunnen tid
boldt Vår ulv lenket
Mene i til evig tid

Fenris er løs!

Nå er vår visdom
Slukt av gammelt hat
De ni skritt er fullendt
En ny vei er lagt

[English translation:]

Forget all laws, all order and peace
Chaos is everything; no time or place
Now when all light and life ends
When the wind now is killing
The chains has broken...

The time has come
As the norns predicted
Nothing lasts forever
The battle at Vigrid shall come
There is no brothers
There is no strong bounds
The bound anger is loose
Inner coldness is free
A river of foam
Has dried up
The power of the wolf, obscure hate
No longer sees a limit

Angrboda beared
Her name justly
With Lauyíus son she breeded
Dread, hate and death
A cry of warning in the dark
The mountains roofs, bear tendors
Woman beard, the sound of catsteps
Breath from the fish, spit from the bird
Tamed forces from a forgotten time
Has held our world in chains
But not for ever!

Fenris is loose

Now our wisdom
Is swallowed by ancient hate
The nine steps are fulfilled
A new road is lain

4. Black Mountain Plateaus (Svarte Vidder)
The ravens are flying, the one eyed watches
Into the fog, shadows appear
Memories from the first empire covered with gold
Runes scratched in, scratches in by hatred
The hordes of the one eyed are riding once again
Hammer crushes cross
Inverted by the unbound
Dark clouds gather, the light retreats

Burned landscape, where it earlier bloomed
Battle fields for the first
A black empire, eternal winter
Frozen fields, eternal cold
Lightening and thunder commands from the first
Eternal storms, an evil monsoon
A wall of darkness
The voice is calling, the circle completed

The age of wolves
Hunger and despair
Mother earth
Expect your death

Warriors are gathered through the dream
Re-conquering the old norse throne
Under new flags
With the swords held high
The ravens are flying, the one eyed watches
Into the fog, shadows appear
Falling icons in a holy war
Black mountain plateaus the battle is won

The age of wolves
Hunger and despair
Mother earth
Expect your death

5. Yggdrasil
I know that I hung
In the windcold tree
Nine whole nights
With hurt point
To Oden given
Self given to myself
In that tree
Which nobody knows
From which roots it ran

not given bread
They brought no horns
Saw down from the tree
Took up runes
Took them with screams
And down from the tree I fell

Nine magic songs I got
From the famous son of
Boltorn, Bestlas father
And a drink I got
Of precious mead
Poured by Odrere

Then I became vigorous
And got wise
Grew and felt well
Of word sought word
Me word again
Of work sought work
Me work again

6. Jotunblod
Bottomless abyss, ginnungagap
Darkness without end before the morning of time
The cold empire's eleven rivers frozen
Frost mist spreads itself wide out
The gust from Nivlhel in the north fills the mighty gap
Licking tongues of fire from the south
Boiling, bubbling venom

All life has it's origin in a source of
Jotunblood
Your mind's own evil inner:
Jotunblood

Screams from Hvergelmes source
United with nauseating drops of venom
The first, the father of all families
Created by the two elements
With himself he breeded
Our proud ancestors
Our primitive force's deep roots
With energy from the cattle's four rivers

A knife through the dark
A shrill scream
A pale face foams
He wanders proudly over Ymer's bones

All life has it's origin in a source of
Jotunblood
Your mind's own evil inner:
Jotunblood

If one seeks all Midgard's knowledge
If the wise woman swings her staff
One can not avoid one's origin
The chaos of the primitive force:
Jotunblood

7. Gylfaginning
He wandered on fine old paths
He wandered along high ridges
He wandered towards the heart of Midgard
He wandered until he saw a mountain

Over a bridge wet with dew he walked
Through the golden gate of Asgard
He saw the vigorous gardens of gods
Crowned around the father of All's high castle

'O father of all, I Ganglere ask:
How have we all come to existence and where do we end?
Answer, O high, even high and third
what is mankind and the race of gods' faith?'

Gylfaginning, deception for he who was wrongly taught
But not for the one who knows Gylfaginning
Grimnes revelation

8. Wotan
Naked, waste landscape
Vast plains lead to the seashore in the west
A northern wind sweeps over dead bodies
A stranger has entered the domains of the vikings

Die not lying sick, dastardly coward
Draw sword, fight with the war gods
Wotan!

We shall fight until we see Ritrost
We shell fight until Heimdal flows the Gjallarhorm
We shall fight for our domains
We shall fight with the war gods
Wotan!

Die not lying sick, dastardly coward
Draw sword, fight with the war gods
Wotan!

9. Queen Of The Ice Desolates (Isöders Dronning)
On the balcony she beholds and longs
Queen of the ice desolates
Alone and weeping she bears the sorrow
Queen of the ice desolates

In the land where day is night and night is day
Bulks a castle with walls of ice, covered with white frost
Outside these walls exists no life
Memories of warmth frozen into snow crystals

In the land where the wind weeps, the child of tragendy lives
Horn of frost and cold, dressed in the snow
Bears who form to pearls run from her eyes
...Memories of joy frozen into pearls of ice

the woman in the castle of ice bears the curse
There where she will die
Queen of the ice desolates

A lonely raven passes by
It seeks further on towards the warmth
On wings it is free
The woman in the castle bears the curse
There she will die, but will anybody
Remember?


5. Heimdallr
[performed by Enslaved]Heimdall is the name of an Old Norse God; 
He is called the Old White Norse God; 
He is great and holy; 
His teeth are made of gold; 
His horse is named Goldtop. 
He lives where it's called the mountain in the sky besides 
Bifrost. 
He needs less sleep than a bird; 
He sees night as clear as day 
One thousand miles away from where he is; 
He also hears the grass grow from the soil, 
Or the wool on the sheep and everything that can be heard. 
He possess the horn that is called the Gjallarhorn, 
And they can hear him blowing the horn in all the homes.

1. 793 (Slaget Om Lindisfarne)
[793 (The Battle Of Lindisfarne)]

[Lyrics by Grutle Kjellson 1995/96]
[Music by Ivar Bjørnson 1995/96]

Strokes from oars could be heard,
Beautiful ships gushed through the sea
Like a wind from the north,
Our ancestors reached the shore
Men from Hordaland, Rogaland and Adger
Gathered for battle in common
Proud men with no fear
Strokes from the sword crushed the skull of the christian

A long time we ruled, kings of the north
Many battles we won, at the shores of Midgard
But, betrayed by our own brothers
We were forced down on our knees
Now when the wind once again is howling
The thoughts finally goes towards home
We shall rise in our glory
The white horde will for sure shiver

"We died like men
Therefore we never vanished
Weak is the one the enemy loves
Never betray your origin"

[Norwegian]

Åretak hørtes, vakre langskip fosset frem
Som en vind fra nord, kom våre fedre i land
Horder, Ryger og Egder, samlet til felles strid
Staute menn uten frykt
Sverdslag knuste kristmanns skalle

Lenge herkset vi, Nordens konger
Mange slag vi vant ved Midgards strender
Men, sveket av våre enge, ble vi tvunget ned i kne
Når vinden nå igjen jager, vender tankene omsider hjem
Vi skal reise oss i vår prakt
Sannelig skal kvitehorden skjelve

"Vi falt som menn
Derfor døde vi ei hen
Veik er den som fiender elsker
Svik ei ditt opphav"

2. Hordalendingen
[The Man From Hordaland]

[Lyrics by Grutle Kjellson 1995]
[Music by Ivar Bjørnson 1995]

Waves are cutting like a knife of time
On the slippery rocks that still stands besides the shore
Two eyes are eyeing the seas
Towards the seas that once brought his ancestors glory

A lonely mind is longing
For the raising of sails
A swordarm is longing hungrily
To cut the throats of cowards

A forgotten treasure is now recovered
Brought out from the darkness of Midgard
Its powers will never again disappear
It is guarded by a man from Hordaland

A night of sorrow will soon be over
Memories from ancient times will glow
A wind blows away the dust from an ancient sword
Two ravens will predict his return

The sets in the west
He lifts his proud face
He looks towards the North Star
The Man From Hordaland

[Norwegian]

Bølgene skærer som en tidens kniv
På de glatte svaberg som ennå står
To øyne skuer utover de hav
Som i fordums tider bar hans slekt til heder

Et stille sinn lengter
Etter atter å heise seil
En sverdram hungrer
Etter nidmanns strupe

En bortglemt skatt er nå gjennfunnet
Båret ut fra Midgards mørke
Den kraft skal aldri mer forsvinne
Den voktes av en mann fra Hordaland

En sorgtung natt er snart over
Et fordums minne lyser opp
En vind blåser støv fra et gammelt sverd
To ravner varsler hans komme

Solen går ned i vest
Han løfter sitt stolte ansikt
Han skuer mot Nordstjernen
Mannen fra Hordaland

3. Alfablot
[Sacrifice To The Elves]

[Lyrics by Grutle Kjellson 1993/96]
[Music by Ivar Bjørnson 1996]

Bring forth your sacrifice
The winter can last for long
Show them honour
Servants of Frey
Let the blood flow
On his pride
Until they are pleased
To provide our magnificense and growth

Our king will show his wrath
If we do not honour our promise
Poor the harvest will be
Without seeds in earth

Don't spill the finest blood
Strong sons will not be born too often

"Oh, wise Volve when shall I get to see, fields of growth
When shall I once again feel the light touch from Freyas hands"

Death comes fast
If you do not honour
The people below
The friends of the Vanirs
Bring forth
The holy boar
Then the sun will still shine
And we can still breath

We didn't wish to die
We didn't wish to awake
The wrath of the elders
Bring forth the holy boar

[Norwegian]

Bring frem ditt offer
Vinteren kan lett bli lang
Vis dem ære
Frøys undersåtter
La blodet renne
Over hans stolthet
Til de er begjæret
For vår prakt og vår grøde

Vred blir vår konge
Hvis ei vårt løfte blir holdt
Skral blir den avling
Som ei er blitt sådd

Spill ei det beste blod
Sterke sønner fødes ei i overflod

"Kloke volve når skal jeg få se, Grøderike enger"
"Når skal jeg igjen få føle, Frøyas myke hender"

Døden kommer fort
Om en ikke ærer
Folket der under
Vaneguders frender
Bring fram
Den hellige Galte
Så solen ikke slukner
Så vi fremdeles kan ånde

Vi ønsket ei å dø
Vi ønsket ei å vekke
De eldstes harme
Bring fram den hellige Galte

Spill ei det beste blod
Sterke sønner fødes ei i overflod

"Kloke volve når skal jeg få se, Grøderike enger
"Når skal jeg igjen få føle, Frøyas myke hender"

4. Kvasirs Blod
[The Blood of Kvasir]

[Lyrics by Grutle Kjellson 1996]
[Music by Ivar Bjørnson & Grutle Kjellson 1996]

A war ruled in ancient times
Between the holy races, the Vanirs and the Aces
When peace came, the deities united
From a bowl filled with spit rose Kvasir

"Wise he becomes, he drinks the holy mead
The blood of Kvasir, but not he who drinks
From the spilled mead that dripped
From the falcon"

Kvasir the father of poets by dwarf hands he died
From the blood of Kvasir they made the mead of poets,
The holy drink
Fjalar and Galar once murdered Gilling the Giant,
The father of Suttung
Enraged, Suttung demanded justice to be fullfilled
The blood of Kvasir became the mead of Suttung

Grimne flew out from Valhalla
In the shape of the falcon
To the home of Giants and to Nitberg
Bauge was decived, and Gunnlod betrayed

Out from Nitberg the falcon flew
Finally Kvasir should return to Aasgard
But when the mead disappeared Suttung became furious
Out, in the shape of the eagle he followed
Sadly, Grimne had to spill from his valuable treasure
Which led to the making of the false poets
The falcon flew home to his domains
And Suttung flew into the flames of Tjalve

[Norwegian]

I gammel tid hersket det en krig
Mellom de hellige slekter, baner og æser
Da freden kom, ble guddommene forent
Opp fra et kar med spytt steg Kvarsir

"Vis blir den som drikker av mjøden,
Kvarsis blod, men ei den som drikker
Av den spillte mjød som dryppet fra
Falkens ham"

Kvarsir, hvis skalders far han var,
Ble tatt av dage av dvergehender
Av Kvarsirs blod lagde de skaldemjøden deh hellige drikk
Fjalar og Galar myrdet en gang Gilling jotun, Suttungs far
I Sinne krevde Suttung mannebot
Kvarsir blod ble Suttungs mjød

Ut fra Valhall flasket Grimne
Kledd opp i falkens drakt
Til Jotunheimen og Nitberg
Bauge bie narret og Gunnlod sveket

Ut fra Nitberg falken fløy
Omsider skulle Kvarsir hjem,
Men da mjøden forsvant ble Suttung vred
Ut han styrtet i ørneham

Akk, måtte Grimne slippe dyrebar last
Slik ble de falske skalder skapt
Falken fløy hjem til sin borg
Og suttung inn i Tjalves flammer

5. For Lenge Siden
[A Long Time Ago]

[Lyrics by Grutle Kjellson 1995]
[Music by Ivar Bjørnson 1995]

Hymns were sung
In the times when our people still were proud
In the long gone past
A long time ago

Then came the disease
The disease from south
Deception and false knowledge
Infected our minds

Survival of the fittest was forgotten
But still it didn't disappear
Beneath the layers of a thousand years of deception
Burns the ancient northern thoughts

Fight! Don't let your powers disappear
Our sunset shall also be our dawn

They burned our temples
They killed our men
We shall take back
What once were ours

Fight! Deny not your mind
Our sunset shall also be our dawn

We shall once again sing
Hymns from ancient times
Like we did in those days
A long time ago

[Norwegian]

Lovsanger ble sunget
Den gang folket fremdeles var stolt,
I de svundne tider,
For lenge siden

Så kom pesten
Pesten fra sør
Svik og vranære
Forpestet våre sinn

Den sterkes lov ble glemt
Men forsvant ei
Under et lag av tusen års svik
Ulmer den norrøne tanke

Kjemp! La ei din kraft forgå
Vår morgen skal også bli vår kveld

De brente våre hov
De drepte våre menn
Vi skal ta tilbake
Det som engang var vårt

Kjemp! Fornekt et ditt sinn
Vår morgen skal også bli vår kveld

Vi skal igjen synge
Lovsanger fra fordums tid
Slik vi gjorde i de dager
For pesten kom
FOR LENGE SIDEN

6. Glemt
[Forgotten]

[Lyrics and Music by Ivar Bjørnson]

The silence inside this place is screaming
Here, were the roses never wither, as they never bloomed
Here the sun never shone
Even the darkness never came in

No hope, no fear
An ocean of tears, that never fell
Tomorrow brings remembrance of opened wounds
The light invaded the endless darkness

A soul, which birth was denied
A soul that became forgotten

The darkness fades away even the brightest colour
The street is empty, and leads to nowhere
A shrilling scream, that no one heard
Who cares? We can all be free

"Tomorrow is a new day
But today was new as well...
... For only thing is fear fealt
The fear of life"

Fallen asleep, wrapped in a blood red blanket
Two dead eyes are staring into emptiness
From a soul, which birth was denied
Death greets the one life forgot

[Norwegian]

Hvor stillheten er øredøvende her inne
Hvor rossene aldri visner, da de aldri blomstret
Her fant solen aldri frem
Selv mørket snur i døren

Intet håp, ingen frykt
Et hav av tårer som aldri rant
Morgendangen bringer bud om åpnede sår
Lyset invaderte det endeløse mørket

Den klareste farge blir dim om natten
Gaten er tom og leder ingensteds
Et strik som skar, men ingen hørte
Hvem bryr seg? Vi kan alle bli fri

"I morgen er en ny dag,
Men det var også i dag...
...Blott den ene frykten kjennes
Frykten for lyvet"

Sovnet inn, i ei blodrødt pledd
To døde øyne stirrer tomt
Fra en sjel som ble nekter født
Døden hilset den som lyvet glemte

7. Eld
[Fire]

[Lyrics by Grutle Kjellson 1996]
[Music by Ivar Bjørnson & Grutle Kjellson 1996]

Born in a flames in the time before time
In the sparkling embrace of Muspellheim
Born to be your souls darked depths
Before Audhumla, our ancient mother awakened

When your eyes is glowing with hate
A hate older than both men and gods
Then you see the light of Muspell
To strong for any man to tame
The oldest force will man never understand
In the deepest domains of fire, man can never reign

Stronger than the grip of death
Mightier than the lights of Norns
Wiser than Fimbul-Tul
More betraying than the son of Faarbaute

That, who once brought forth life
And gave us Mother Earth
Shall return in the flames of Surt
Our flesh shall burn at Ragnarok
Our souls shall be united in FROST & FIRE

1. Living Beneath The Hammer
Windswept landscape, desolated mountain plateaus
The Deepest woods and darkest scrubs
Flords and mountains are our landmarks
in a life beneeath the Hammer

A long and narrow kingdom
Ruled by trinity
From stormy mountain tops covered with snow
We behold the kingdom of the Hammer

We ride along the paths of Midgard
Fog from the soil rises at our feets
To the west the shore can be seen,
where the first sat foot ashore
Where they raised sail towards north

2. A Winter's Night
A dark, chilling winters night
Unsilently awoken by song and dance
From above rains the golden arrows of Thor
Moonbeams enlighten the ring

Nine torches for those nine in the circle
Surrounded by nine shadows for nine souls
In the middle, an altar of fire, soil, water and wind
Look, and behold yourself

3. Fires Of Midgard
The call of the Gjallarhorn
Return to the ring of our forefathers gods
The flames of Midgard's fires and ancient mystisism still are

]sg}rdsreien rides with terror above the village
Mjolner is swung, thunder and lightening!
The landmarks of the Vikings
Wolves and ravens guards the throne

4. Heimdallr
Heimdall is the name of an Old Norse God;
he is called the Old White Norse God;
he is great and holy;
his teeth are made of gold;
his horse is named Goldtop.
He lives where it's called the mountain in the sky besides
Bifrost.
He needs less sleep than a bird;
he sees night as clear as day
one thousand miles away from where he is;
he also hear the grass grow from the soil,
or the wool on the sheep and everything that can be heard.
He possess the horn that is called the Gjallarhorn,
and they can hear him blowing the horn in all the homes.

2. I Lenker Til Ragnarok
[Loke - del II]
[##-Voluspå]
[Tekst: Grutle Kjellson]

Eiteren drypp, jorda skakar
Eg vrir meg i smerte, lenka til berget

Eg er din angst, eg er din pine.
Tema meg du freista, du fanga meg i garn.
Eg let meg ikkje rokka, eg er kaos
eg er din skam.

Eg er din øvste visdoms bror,
og din fiende til din døyande dag.

Bunden eg er, men eg ler av deg.
Tru ikkje eg er til for å tena deg.

Eg er av ei verd du aldri (i ditt liv) kan skjøna,
for eg er vondskap, eg er urkraft.

Ein dag skal me møtast på Vigridsletta.
Ein dag er eg fri for lenker og eiter.
Den dagen vil du skjøna kvifor eg blei til,
kvifor latteren gjallar i natta.
Den dagen skal me kjempa vår siste kamp,
og ta kvarandre av dage.
# ...Sola svartnar, jord sig i hav
på hummelen bleiknar bjarte stjerner
Røyken velatr fra veldige bål
Høgt leikar flammen
mot himmelen sjøl... #

[Musikk: Ivar Bjørnson]

[English translation: IN CHAINS UNTILL RAGNAROK]

[Lyrics: Grutle Kjellson]
[## Voluspå]

The ether is dripping, the earth is quaking
I am writhing with agony, chained to the mountain

I am your fear, I am your torment
You attemped to tame me, you caught me in nets
I will not be budged, I am chaos, I am your shame

I am your highest wisdom, and your enemy
'til your dying day

Bound I am, but I am laughting  at you
Do not believe that I am here to serve you

I am from a world you can not comprehend
'Cause I am Evil I am the Primal Force

One day we shall meet at the fields of Vigrid
One we  I shall be free of chains and ether
That day you will understand
The purpose of my excistance 
Why the laughter is roaring in the night
Åhat day we will fight our last battle
Ônd end eachothers  days

#The sun turns black, ground slides into the sun
Brave stars are fading in the sky
Smoke rises from great fires
The flame plays up high
Against heaven itself#

[Music: Ivar Bjørnson]

3. Urtical Gods
[Lyrics: Dirge Rep]

Activate the aggression that exposes the
Hidden,
Denying the existance  pf  praying to
Illusions
Seek gnosis in the forbidden
Drink from the wates of knowledge
And see what lies you breathe

Absorb the vital spark of deities false
And ressurect the true gods
To whom strength and wisdom is the key
And not the lectures of folly
Annoint your sould  with pleasure
Apposed  to mummifications through impotence

The truth is unconscious, asleep
Waiting to be summoned, to be worshipped
A neglected phallos, banished from thought
A weapon overseen by the creator
But cherished by those of the path
Unlock the beast
Transform

4. Ansuz Astral
[Tekst: Ivar Bjørnson]

ANSUZ, ANSUZ!
- Skipet fa frå kai
Aldri vil ho vende att;
ho er trygg i stjernenatt

WUNJO, WUNJO!
- Reisa har vërt lang
Han som sød kjem draumen til;
tek han dit han draume vil

Vidare frå tanken;
fri frå kjød
Ingen svar, ingen sirkel
Evig fødsel, evig død

"...Eg tok og eg fekk
Eg fall, flaug og gjekk
Det vart mørkt og eg såg
Djupt ned, kor det tyste rår..."

Me vandra fritt og langt
Lyset kom, og synet svann
Husa er tomme, og himmelen raud;
Skipet legg frå kai

[Musikk: Ivar Bjørnson & R. Kronheim]

[English translation: ANSUZ ASTRAL]

[Lyrics: Ivar Bjørnson]

ANSUZ, ANSUZ!
The ship left for the sea
Never will she return
She is safe in the starry night

WUNJO, WUNJO!
The journey's been long
The dream comes to the sleeping
Brings him where he longs to dream

Further from thought,
free from the flesh
No answers, no circles
eternal birth, eternal death

"...I took and received
I fell, flew and walked
It was dark and I saw
Deep below, where silence roars..."

We wandered far and freely
The light came, and the sight faded
The houses are abandoned, and the sky is red
The ship is leaving for the sea.

[Musikk : Ivar Bjørnson & R. Kronheim]

5. Nidingaslakt
[Tekst: Grutle Kjellson]

Horna gjallar, vinden bles
Trommer dundrar, vinded bles
Med spjut og boge meter til strid
Me går i bresjen brødre gjennom blod.
Med von om ëre i galskapens namn
Me vert aldri slegn sjøl om me fell

Me reiser ei til Folkvang til,
vanedronnings famn, våre fedre skal
me møta om me fell i dag.
Me flytar ei frå var lagnad sjølv
om vinden ikkje bles vår vei.
Til valfaders hall brødre.

Med heva spjut i Odins namn.
Me skal heva krus i Odins namn
Nidingar skal falla for våre føtter.
Dei treng ikkje be om sollyse dagar.
Ingen hugsat ein trëll uten herre
Slegne vert dei når dei fell.

Me hevar våpen for vår tru
Me slaktar marken for vår tru
Ingen nåde me viser
for dei som snudde ryggen til.
Døy skal dei som freista
å mura brunnen inn.
ei som for med løgn og svik
Gje oss styrke, gje oss mot
Me skal sigra, brødre gjennom blod.

[Musikk: R. Kronheim]

[English translation: NIDINGASLAKT]

[Lyrics: Grutle Kjellson]

Horns are resounding, the winds are howling
Drums are pounding, the winds are howling
With spear and bow we go into battle
We are making a stand, brothers in blood
With hope for honour in the name of madness
We will never be defeated, even if we fall

We are not going to Folkvang,
Into the arms of the Vanir Queen,
We shall  our fathers if we fall today
We will not flee from our destiny,
even though the winds aren't blowing our way
Brothers, to Valfaders hall

With spear raised in the name of Oden
We shall raise mugs in the name of Oden
Cowards shall fall at our feet
They do not have to pray for sun filled days
No one remembers a slave without a master
Defeated they are when they fall

We raise weapons for our faith
We slaughter the fields for our faith
We have no mercy for those
Who turned their backs
Those who attemmp to close the well
Shall die
Those who lied and betrayed shall die
Give us strenght , give us courage
We will prevail
Brothers in blood

[Music: R. Kronheim]

6. Eit Auga Til Mimir
[Tekst: R. Kronheim, Grutle Kjellson, Dirge Rep]

Utgards mørke, langt der ute
Eg kjem ikkje inn, eit offer du krev?
Eit offfer eg krev, ingen lovnad eg gjen
Eg kan gje deg styrke, eg kan gje deg dauden
De seier du kan ta meg av dage.
Du seier du kan ta meg av dage.
Men utan meg er heller ikkje du
Skapar av svakhet, meg kan du ikkje truga.
Lær deg å sjå med det retta auga.
Du dunkle, du freistar å få meg i knt,
du taler i gåter, og får meg vred.
Med vrede, du veike, du ingenting får.
Din visdom eg krev for at du skal forstå
Du vil eg skal lida, og endå til dõy.
Du gløymer mi makt, at du er min trëll.
Ditt opphav du gløymer. Du prisar bedrag
Di verd er ei faginning, ingen heilhet, ingen svar
Orden eg skaper, men du motstrebar meg
Du talar med klõrt, kva er det du krev.
Eg krev eit offer, eg krev at du blør.
Du våga å trosse dei eldste, som bar deg fram

"Utgards mørke langt der ute, eit offer vart krevd,
eit offer dei fekk, Eit sinn vart styrka, men
lekam gjekk tapt, Klok vert den som veit å våga"

"Han ofra sitt auge, for at fjan skulle sjå
Han blødde for dei som til slutt lot han rå.
Men ingen lovnad ei ga ham, det vart ingen fred.
Dei skal fframleis kjempa, til jorda sig ned"

[Musikk: Grutle Kjellson]

[English translation: AN EYE FOR MIMIR]

[Lyrics: R. Kronheim, Grutle Kjellson, Dirge Rep]

The darkness of Utgard, far out there
I can not enter, are you demanding sacrifce ?
I demand a sacrifice, no promise I will give
I can provide you with strenght , I can give you death

You say you can end my days
But without my excistance , would you not be
Creator of weakness, me you can not threaten
Learn how to see with the right eye
Obscure One, you attemp to get me on my knees
You speak through riddles, and call forth my wrath
With wrath, weakling, nothing is achieved
I demand your wisdom, to make you understand
You want me to suffer, and even to die
You are forgetting my power, you are but my slave
Your source of origin you're forgetting, your praising deceit
Your world is an illusion; no wholeness, no answer
Order I crfeate, but your opposing me
Your speaking with a cunning tongue, what are your demands
I am demanding a sacrifice, I demand to see you bleed
You have dared to oppose the Ancient Ones that brought you into excistance


The darkness  of Utgard, a sacrifice was demanded, a sacrifice they received
A mind was strengthened, but the flesh was lost
He who dares becomes wise

"He gave his eye to see
He bled for those who let him rule at last
But no promises they gave him, no peace became
They shall still be fighting 'til the earth sinks"

[Music: Grutle Kjellson]

7. Blodhemn
[Tekst: Grutle Kjellson]

Du drap min son, fjemn eg svergar
Du øydela min veg, og fred med mitt folk
Du sverta mitt namn, dei trudde deg

D trudde min lagnad var spott og spe
Du trudde eg med mitt banesår døydde
Du trudde eg aldri skulle reisa meg

Du trudde lyset var din ven,
at du av dt var komen
Du trudde ale ville lystra ddeg
og gløyme valfaders gåver

Du gløymde din far sine vise ord
om svik, lagnad og død.
Du gløymde di plikt
som ein kjempande mann
og drap din bror i sveven.

Du trudde tid lækjar såê
ôå üøåå àùäë ûëãääó åøäïîó ùï èóþ
Âã ïäøymde meg og mi heilage plikt,
eg skal drepa eg i vrede.

Blodhemn eg svergar,
Blodhemn har eg alltid sverga.

[Musikk: Ivar Bjørnson & R. Kronheim]

[English translation: VENGEANCE IN BLOOD]

[Lyrics: Grutle Kjellson]

You killed my son, I am swearing revenge
You destroyd my path, and truce with my peaople
You blackended my name, they believed you

You saw my destiny as mockery
You was me dying with my fatal wound
You thought I would never rise

You thought the light was your friend,
That you sprung from it
You thought everyone would obey your words
And forget the gifts of Valfather.

You forgot your father's wise words
of betrayal, destiny and death
You forgot your duty as a man of strife,
and killed your brother sleeping

You thought time would heal the wounds,
that my people would forgive and pray
You forgot about me and my holy duty
I will kill you with anger

Vengeance in blood I swear
Vengeance in blood I have always sworn

[Music: Ivar Bjørnson, R. Kronheim]

8. Brisinghamen
[Tekst: Grutle Kjellson]

Einsam ho gret, den vakraste av alle
Fanga og låst i ei sorg ingen skjøner

Gleden forsvann langt, langt der ute.
Ei brennande lyst, en ingen håp.
Ho lengtar heim, men finn ingen veg.
Ein sorgfull lagnad gøymt bak eit smil.

Mardol du fagre for fred du blei ofra
Du solgte din lekam, men fann ingen trøyst.
Det som glimrar gjer ikkje fred for deg

Gern du ga deg hen, og slokka mangt
eit begjær. Men, framleis drypp
det om natta gull frå dine auge.

Frøya, od skal du finna når alt er forbi
då skal du bli sluppen fri.
Inntil den dag finn du inga trøyst.
Sjøl ikkje i glitrande Brisinghamen.

[Musikk: R. Kronheim & Ivar Bjørnson]

[English translation: BRISINGHAMEN]

[Lyrics: Grutle Kjellson]

In solitude she cries, the most beautiful of them all
Captured and locked in a sorrow no one can conceive
Joy vanished far out there
Burning desire, but no hope
She longs for home, bu tcan not find a way
A dismal destiny hidden behind a smile

Mardol, you glorious, sacrificed for peace you were
You sold your flesh, but found no comfort
That which glitters does not bring you peace

Gern you devoted yourself
and consumed many desire.
But, still in the night,
gold is dripping from your eyes.

Frõya, Od you shall find when everything ends
Then you shall be set free
Untill that day you shall find no comfort
Not even in the shining Brisinghamen

[music: R. Kronheim & Ivar Bjørnson]

9. Suttungs Mjød
[incl. Outro "Perkulator"]

[Tekst: Trad.]

[104]
Jotungubben eg fann
er no attende komen
der få ting eg teiande fekk
med mange ord
eg mykje til gagn
vann meg i Suttungs salar

[105]
Gunnlòd meg gav på gullstolen
drykk av den dyre mjød
vesal løn let eg ho få
ho gav meg trygt si tru,
ho gav meg heile sin hug

[106]
Rata-Tonni rudde meg veg
gardt grjot ho gnog
over og under var jotunvegar,
då gjekk det på livet laust

[107]
Det vene eg vann, eg vel hev n¢ti
lite den vise vantar
med di Odrere no opp er komen
midt i Midgards fjeim

[108]
Uvisst å vita om eg endå var
komen or Jotungarden ut, om ikkje
Gunnlòd, det gode kvendet, hadde
vorti min sële ven

[109]
Andre dagen av gjekk rimtussa
til å spørje råd av råd av Hår
i Håvahalli; etter Bolverk dei spurde,
om han var berga hjå gudom,
eller Suttung hadde slegi han ned

[110]
Ein eid då svor
Odin på ringen,
kven kan hans trygdemål tru?
Suttung han sveik for (skalde) drykken,
og Gunnlòd sårt han grøtte

ENSLAVED LYRICS


1. Convoys To Nothingness
Faces - eyes - noise

Floating patterns of no coherency, none needed

From behind the chapel of dreams came imagery
From another world
The left for a brighter star
A new home called "now"

Womb - death - dawn

Follow seafarers on an ocean of silence
Remaining humanoid shells, a distant thought
The chasm between truth and flesh paved
With bricks from secret cities

Entering linear orbit
Crushing the foundations of divided times
Suns reflected

Convoys...
Convoys to...
Convoys to nothingness...

2. The Voices
I hear their poisonous words again
As they call out for submission and code
"To be less than one and drown equals pride" they say
These were the voices that destroyed us

Did I want for this loss to be sustained?

Through the clipping of wings found the secret paths
From the blinding light of lies obtained second sight
Stabbed in the back, gained strength in One-ness
Taken from me, I learned to preserve

These were the voices that sunk our ships
These are the voices - poisoned ears bleeding

Did I pray for the dead to be kept awake?
Did I gently place these thorns through the surface
of my eyes?
Did I ask for this fathomless tragedy to go on forever?

Fail to comply - reborn in war
The answer being no

Did I?

3. Vision: Sphere Of The Elements (A Monument Part II)
Betrayed by disillusion
Enslaved by insanity
Enslaved by commitment to betrayal
Betrayed by all elements

My vision is clear and strong
I comfort myself to fulfil it
There exists no edge
Clearly existence is wrong

I kill myself to fulfil my vision
Consumed by astral interference
I deny this monument to be my sphere
I choke this ego to find that i'm dead
I deny this monument to be my sphere

I will die as one

4. Hollow Inside
Hollow inside - I didn't sleep too well last night
Step over, turn the light
Hollow inside - I didn't dream too much last night
Step over, turn the light

Knock on the door - these are the interfering themes
Open it up, too soon

Shorter in time - the interactive parts go by
I fear for a while - my head

I fear for a while - that my head will expand
And stretch out in to the stratos wild

Can't you see, those birds in limbo breaks
And of course you hear, listen, the straws
From above you, and underneath in the glow
I can touch them
Spiritualized

Dogs with bones, they are released
One too many to get on

5. The Cromlech Gate
[The fool:]
"Fear not dear kinsmen, cause you
Saviour I am. I'll bring back our glory
And wisdom Achieve I'm searching the
Old path to bring back the elder"

Smug as only the fool can be, mindless
Blindly. He marches towards his fate
Summoned by the Cromlech by hunger within

[Voice from a parallel existance:]
"Come inside my friend, your father is waiting.
Your search ends here, Wisdom you have
gained, the signs you have read."

Doomed to walk the smiths dungeons
Underworld slavery
Through the eyes of the fool nothing can be seen
The elder is hiding beyond thoughts
Only leaving with glimpses of long lost knowledge

I once saw the Cromlech and was kindly invited
But I stayed the beast I kissed the ground
(I drank the wine)
(I took up the runes)
I found the home of the elder

6. Enemy I
It was here I was born
While the stars held their breaths
After ages of pseudo-presence

I climbed the final steps
Up from deep beneath the shores
Eieth no longer sleeping gal

Thus alive and the stillness
Only to be broken by whispers
Towards the moon

Bloodred from the Unborn Ones cries
That will not be silenced or rest
Forever more and awaken not

To paint in blanks or wither
Beauty blinding no more
than the whole is less now

We see clearly what was not there
The prey become predator
Slaughtering not raging blindly

Through tunnels of sorrow and lust
For solitude and peace of mind
Says it is time to unmask and face

Behind lines  - that is Enemy I

7. Smirr
He sees his world through the crystal state of departure
The hooves echo the approach of the third coming
On it's back a goddess with shining black armour
The steel that will separate the will from doing
Closing in as he falls to his knees, surrounded by
Plasma of dying chapters
Life succumbs to silence, desire alone to the dying
Of inner banes
His hands no longer grasping contraction as he laughs

Winds play their mourners dirge through heaps of corpses
The hooves thundering the arrival of the final coming
Carrying forth the seeds of eternal night
So that the Shadow may sleep, eternity weeps
While we laugh and remain forever

She feels the cold floor giving no comfort as she fades 
The hooves echo the approach of the third coming
On it's back the faceless her Elder Ones saw
The agents of microcosmic change shattering the megalith
Stories told, divinity unfold
She passes on, yet remains in Smirr
Cold remains scattered in dead void dreams

8. The Sleep: Floating Diversity (A Monument Part III)
The battle's now past
The war of all was within itself

Painfully sleeping

All hail the fallen
The time is now for the king to tell

The battle's now past

All hail the fallen
Pleading diversity equals no scream
Thickening intensity now fatal
Beyond portrayed dream

The rooster fell dead in the dust
Before the break of dawn
But I knew time

The horse hung from worn out straps
With ungreatfulness
Wipped into his eyes
But I pulled the plow myself

The peasant laid himself down on the fields
Neither plenty nor free - but I cleared new land

Growths withered, eternal oaths shattered
Colours faded, hearts froze cold
The noise silenced, but mine was victory and might
Larger than time - heavier than night

Mountains fell, forestgreen to black
Time turned to silence, water to sand
The sun went cold, gone all but one light
Larger than time - heavier than night

Days ended, and the stars died
Before the wanderers reached home
But I knew the way

Ships sunk with all warriors and heralds
Laid to rest in bottomless pits
But I spotted new and unknown shores

The gods suddenly aged
When the golden walls fell
But I gave them new powers

Like an open wound
Who could endure
If i follow you, will i be like them
Standing tall, with the flag of the hanged ones

They were like the trees
Lifeless - did not speak
Did not move
Cold hand, empty eye (Mimir, do you hear this?)

It is a long journey, but are you growing tired?
Time stands still, everything else is dead
Blood and hymn
The god of corpses' sun
Shines in one and everyone's face

Urd answers in echoes, what will you do?
Where is your hammer
Thurisaz calls: smashed hold of illusion's roots

They were like trees
Lifeless
Did not feel, did not hear
Cold hand, empty eye
Ymir, do you hear this?

They were life trees
Lifeless
Ymir, why are you silent?

3. Entrance / Escape
I am not in there
I am not taking any part in this
There's no comfort where you are
And I won't give you anything

I am close to them mentally
But I am inbetween realities
There is no directions for where I am
They can't find me 'cause I am not in here

A troll screams with longing
Gods drown in fatal wounds
Tunnels of rot grows inside
Strong arms
The mountains will no longer be moved

Only the slave owns his own freedom
When kings follow the laws of christened men

Who will carry forth the silver
Who will guard the bow
Who will judge fairly
With hearts of coal

Worm with no skin
Who would want to
Enter such a world

The great men kill their children with blunt swords
Let them regret
Let them suffer
But give them no comfort

Never give them your hand
Never let them see the eye

Toothless bastards
Who wants to hear such words
The white christ kills his mother

Let them freeze, let them starve
But give them no comfort

If the few endures the journey
Then, we will build the wall
If the few endures the journey
Then we will build the wall
If the few endures the journey
Then we will build the wall

Seventy and thousand feet below
A pulse is beating more evenly
And higher
Waves expand like heartbeats
Through silent mosaic

A wise man
Three heights he was
Once came down here and said:
"What was, was never"

Then they saw the river
Burn, and the sun bled
Then they saw the river
Burn, and the sun bled

A norn
She came too
Down from the roots
And the tree of life
"Everything will die and decay
Silence will once again prevail"
Then they heard the song choking
And the children dying

Seventy and thousand feet below
A pulse is beating more
Evenly and higher
Empty universes in every world
Up there, where dreams die

[NIGHTMARE]

Fall in flames
Trapped under ice
Ridden by nightmares forever

The ending blue
Obscure and promising
In ancient red it orbits
That which once
white was black

Empires circles time
From other to one we go

Deceived to see eternity
If blinded
Silent nothingness
The mountains are moved
From the stars
And the fool
Sees nothing but stones

Empires circles time
From other to one we go

Moaning no one could
Stand listening to
Fills the inner worlds
Clutching the chains
That does not exist
Why not live
Without them?

Empires circles time
From other to one we go

The ending blue
Around a merciless mother
Who will caress us
With the burning skies
Of the last days

The herd ate it's shepherd
And starved to death, smiling
They didn't reach the meadows

You loved your neighbour
And ate your own mother
Losing your own war
Slave in your own chains

You look to the sun
And freeze to death
Torn apart in golden cages
Strangled by purity
Kissing the hand that killed your own brother

Be sure of this
I'll never turn my back to you
Be sure of this
I'll always mock you

Consider what you've created
When you're waiting for death
Listen, out there
Where our laugher is resounding
Think of what's waiting for you
You miserable fool!

We laughed as the hive burned

I went into battle
When the strangers came
I fought for my home and my herd
I struck them down
With my spear and bow
So that those at home could sleep and eat

I drank and yelled
I laughed and bragged
Of my victories, my courage and my strength
I told of the gold I found
At those I had slain before me

Suddenly I awoke
A cold and dark morning
With a dead herd and slaves escaped
All mead and all my friends were gone

That was when I went away to promising land
For once again to return with honour
Everyone that crossed my path
Was to feel my strength and wrath

By a flood stood an old and tired man
He guarded a boat which I needed
I charged to cut him down
But the sword broke
And the old one stood there grinning

"Poor fool, who never had seen
That a warrior shall fight against warrior
You'll never win if you're only looking ahead
And never inwards"
Suddenly the old one was gone
And the wind carried away the boat

By the shore I stood looking
But could not reach the other side
That's when the battle begun
Against the warrior I always thought I knew

I hail the living room with pride
Greeting me with flames and sea
...only he who dares is safe

Home - to a starworld of silver
Home - wolf, man and house

Kenaz - behind the eyes burns the
Light which we own
Raidho - on thoughts above
The sun and rain
Anzus - at the throne of our father
I laugh towards the holy wheel

She will provide us with answers
And the light
Then again we are swept in
Another darkness
...only he who asks becomes wise

Home - with stars of silver
Home - wolf, man and house
("I am - am I")

Warrior, never ask for peace
Husband, always long for home
Here we will be gathered
...if the rune is spinning

1. Intro: Green Reflection
[Instrumental]

2. Lunar Force
Farewell my brother
Farewell my foe
May death embrace you
Your blood in the darkness flow

You were never meant to rule
Never to light up my father's throne
May you suffer deep below
You tried to deprive (me of) my rightful crown

Fallen, defeated, tricked by Beorc,
The Lunar Force
Behold the sorcerer when you're
Impaled by the sword

Farewell my brother
Farewell my friend
May she have pity with you
We did not wish for your life to end

The day will bleak when
The Old One arrives
The King betrayed by his treacherous mind
Defeated by Beorc, The Lunar Force

3. Isa
Been standing here for ages
Watching the valleys blossom and burn
The pyres of yesterday smells of losing you
Preserved we are, portraits (in the glassy depths)
I picked up the shattered mirror, put them in water
Cold as my dreams

Isa: Still - Standing - Empowered
Isa: Watching you die, with tears of ice
Isa: Detached - Silent - Ecstasy
Isa: We are the dead

We arrived here from different spaces
Bidding the wooden shrines farewell
Concealed within dead lips lies the rope
That forged us and then tore us to shreds
Distant opposite assembly at the shores
They're telling me it's time to let go

A time to burn, a time to build
With your own hands a room within that room
Bring it all towards the centre and tremble
Bring her back from the shadows and kiss her
Retrieve the sword from the abyss
Hold back the tidal wave

Isa: Still - Standing - Empowered
Isa: Watching you die, with tears of ice
Isa: Detached - Silent - Ecstasy
Isa: We are the dead

4. Ascension
Staring across the void, seeing eye to eye in folded space
I see you with the colours and frenzy of the sacred rooms
We've met in those dreams; ice blue water ran towards the green sky
The gods spoke to us in their infancy
Suns waiting for us to smitten them with the flames of our disease
And we did so laughing, giving birth to sunrises in our wake

Never in need of sleep, nor in need of truth
I would never have stayed in this darkness, and we would ascend

The taste of ash, no stars above - No green grass below
The last words set ablaze as we saw the inner imagery
How it all came alive when we no longer reached for it
How it all rose and overwhelmed the speechless (us)

In this house without words we came to be one
In these books without text we found the way

A path along a faded memory, without the fear of finding home

We would never have stayed
We would never have stayed
We would never have stayed in this darkness
We would never have stayed
We would ascend

5. Bounded By Allegiance
Brought here by sorrow
Raised in the depths of fear

Consuming sanity
Feasting on the joy of Man

Surrounding the trembling mind
Surrounding the troubled soul
Strength failed to tame the serpent
The offspring of laughter and sadness
Saved by the power of its kin
Obeying the whispering chaos
Pulsating underneath your skin
Feasting 'till the end of time

Denying all peace within
Fearing the freedom it never feels

Bounded by allegiance
To long gone sanity

It lurks deep below

Emerge at the last step

6. Violet Dawning
I am a part of the darkness
Used to watch from afar
Sensing the violence of morning
And breathing... And waiting for nothing
Devouring the spirit, grinding the heart
There are good things in the burning fields
There's peace in the slaughtered flesh
There's life in the frozen seeds

I'll dream in the deserts
And comfort the thirst for seeing
The violet dawn in the distance
Beckons me to steal its light

I'll wait for you here

I'll wait for you here

I'll wait for you here

I'll wait for you here

7. Return To Yggdrasil
A new sound heard throughout the land
From which the spirits had left ages ago
Sacrifice and honour replaced by betrayal and usurpers
A trail of sweat and blood, a gathering to the pagan
outer worlds

For ages we have wandered
Under the wings of deception
Too long have we been waiting
For the long winter to end

An uprising by those that claim the Supremacy of One
Against the misleaders of the blind, deceivers of the Masses
Man can no longer claim ignorance as reason for waiting
It is all for the taking, the world for their making

We will gather again
Under the leaves
We will gather again
In honour of the nine nights

For ages we have wandered
Under the wings of deception
Too long have we been waiting
For the long winter to end

We will gather again
To praise the courage
We will gather again
To watch the harvest

8. Secrets Of The Flesh
[instrumental]

9. Neogenesis
Navigation by the fires of dead worlds
Towards the shores of Neogenesis

Navigation by the fires of dead worlds
Towards the shores of Neogenesis

Distant self now cut through, approaching infinitely
Racing hearts throbbing deep beneath the painted bones
Mars opens the hidden doors to Venus
Lunar flight crashing into solar storms
Blinding unification - vertigo - ecstatic curtain fall
Get ablaze by inner arson, endlessly reborn
Winds, oh the winds that speak of your salt and blood
Break open the dam, flood the deserts

Shocking white pulsar radiant dreams drawn in night sky
Ice-glazed branches undead by rays from an impossible sun
Crystallized pathways towards runic chambers concealed within the microcosmos
Revert away from the predicament, flee across the abyss

Severing the fetal cords spawning fusions by the thousands
Through bent space created black channel - pagan relay
Sensations of flesh flickering
Praising death through bleeding eyes

Neogenesis

1. As Fire Swept Clean The Earth
[Music: Ivar Peersen - Lyrics: Ivar Peersen, Kjetil Grutle]

I close my eyes
As Fire Swept Clean the Earth
Nothing left to strangle
As the cords were torn from our hearts

"Tired I blew out my last warning, the claws were ripping me apart"

As we emerged
From darker dungeons
Splendor of yellow hells
Expanded swollen eyes

No words were said
As Fire Swept Clean the Earth
Would the mothers be crying?
If they saw torches in our hands?

"The wind, once able to conquer, captured As Fire Swept Clean the Earth"

A kiss was placed
Upon my cheek
And all color came back
Melting in solid blue tune

2. The Dead Stare
[Music: Ivar Peersen - Lyrics: Ivar Peersen, Per Arild Husebr]

The Juggler stares
To quench the thirst
Upon the brow
Within the hand
It cracks and seeps
The seer weeps

In flickering light
The wounds are served
Screams from below
A shadow in chains
Feverish images told
In mirrors of old

The eyes they all share
In this tragic court
An empty seat
The river runs dry
Nothing said
Words in red

Behold the druid
As the stones fall
Known aloud turned
Backwards around
Reverse the loss
This never was

3. The Crossing
[Music: Ivar Peersen - Lyrics: Kjetil Grutle]

I no longer struggle
No longer see
Nothing remains, burning anxiety
Darkness came forth
Gave birth to me
Certain death is all I see

I see you weep
I see you suffer
I've seen kingdoms rise and fall
I've seen all that's supposed to be

Earthbound forces, united with sorrow
The path was given in ancient times
Embraced by hunger, forgotten by will
The wisdom is hold up still

Break the chains, come forth to see
Cross the abyss not meant to be
Cross the river, find the key
Kill the queen of anxiety

4. Queen Of Night
[Music: Ivar Peersen - Lyrics: Ivar Peersen]

Across the scorched fields of fathers land
In each step an abyss is built
Through misty dreams he touched her hand
The boar is dead

Its blood is spilt

He set his foot on the slopes of far away
They'd been asleep when his sun roared
He walked through night, walked through day

Landless mourning lord

"Why should we let you by?"

The road is blocked by men of three

"If you need ask, you already know"

They said to let him pass, to leave him be

At the shores of sorrow
How far he'd come (to see her eyes)
(After) Moons and more moons
He'd be there tomorrow

"And I would travel across the water
To where she lies"

On the sea of solitude he rows
The winds howl her name, he has no fears

Tired and smiling he falls, downwards he goes
There she is, waiting after all these years

I see a darkness overwhelming
I see that there is no light for me
I don't care if it leaves me blind
I don't care if I'm left behind

I see a white horse's head
I see it's dead stare fixed at me
I do not fear its eyes
Curse myself, return it twice

I see walls to high to climb
I see nothing on the other side
I should have roamed another space
I should have been another place

I am among ghosts when I should rest
I cannot tell the worlds apart
I do not heed the words they say
There is no dream of another day

I hear a silence, deafening
Drowning the deserts, that is my destiny
I no longer wish to see
The threads they've spun for me.

6. Ridicule Swarm
[Music: Ivar Peersen - Lyrics: Per Arild Husebr]

Pallid it hangs
In awe of amusement
Litany swarm
Bleak I say are the crutches of the assembly
And flies cling to it
More so ever the fingers to animate

Insubordinate, fickle exequies
Putrid core

Naudr........the ligature it can't break
Lagu...........the whispers it can't hear

Insubordinate, fickle exequies
Putrid core

7. A Darker Place
[Music: Ivar Peersen - Lyrics: Ivar Peersen]

Behind the walls
Below the lights

If you came upon a door
If you came to push it open
If your eyes could see within this dark
Your heart would flee
Nails and blood
Painted by delirium
You would feel the empty stare

From a darker place

Silent screams
From ages in the void
Desperation
The voices fill your ears
Head back into the light
Never to return
This dream will haunt you

From a darker place

Behind the walls
Below the lights

1. Entroper
I am the creator of true will

Long have I suffered
Long have I been forced
Blinded by their faith
Laughter resounds no more

I am the son of the ancient breed
I do not pity life
I follow not pathetic order
I am the realm of absurdity
Resistant to their conscience
Free of their constant pain
I was born in the flames

Long did they hope
That my logic would save them at last
Long did I know
That I would watch them die

While harvesting their fruits
Of their impotent threats
They forgot the potency
Of the old independency
Claiming my death would
Change the way of existence
Who, but me handled them?
The weapons of hope

They turned safely into non-existence

I will break the chains
I will slay the betrayers
One last time
The laughter shall resound

2. Path To Vanir
Awaiting my death, gasping for air
The relief emerge, the mistress so fair

Don't abandon me, please grant me life
I embrace your powers, higher wisdom's wife

I've been fighting in vain, but they grew too strong
For my kinsmen this day became far too long

I lie in the open, waiting to die
Were all my life's beauty built on a lie?

My grace you shall get, because I welcome your return
(If) you're not the hidden into sadness I'll turn
I've come to your rescue now before your last breath
My love you will receive, but it will be your death

Fear not, said the mistress, the lady of light
Those who betrayed us would not stand the fright

3. Fusion Of Sense And Earth
Cosmos trembled
When it came to be
Fusion of sense and earth

In awe they looked
Those who feared the dark
At the enemy of hate

All menaces vanished
Conquered by will to live
Marched towards the shores

A war against the abnormal
The obstacles of peace
Victory for the light

"Wisdom and Chaos must unite
The Storm Will Linger On"

When fighting blindfolded
Every beast was possible to slay
No fortress guarded

When the serpents
Spat at the surface of the earth
It howled and laughed

Armoured with good will
Certain of victory
It fell to the ground

"Wisdom and Chaos must unite
The Storm Will Linger On"

4. Ruun
Have you ever seen beyond the reach?
Have you ever felt the change?
Visions from an altered state
They conceal and relevate

Communing once again with Gods
Thread unto the impossible path
Talking with a different tongue
Heralding the unsung

Reach for them, see them turn away

Have you ever seen beyond the reach?
Have you ever felt the change?
Visions from an altered state
They conceal and relevate
Fly away, chains undone

Reach for them, see them turn away

Doors open wide
Step into the light
No turning back
Embrace the night
Breathe eternities
We are not alone
Never to return
Merge with the unknown

5. Tides Of Chaos
I've got this twisted core
I've got this noose around my neck
That (just) won't let go
I've got this dream
In Which I kill you all
And there is no going back
They've choked the good in me
Sent me off to wander alone
Hateful, starving enemy of (your) order
Hunt you down, make you understand
No compassion for the enslavers of will
Your spite for reason makes me strong
Your lack of direction showed me where to go
We've come to share this destiny
No borders, no landmarks
Out in the open
I hold the key to the door
In vivid dreams while awake
I saw a way through
The agony of choice

In a Universe where the storms rage Endlessly
Time will never come to reinstate me
Mine is none

There was a day when I knew silence
Then came the tides of chaos
Washed it all away
I have seen what you have become
Smiling with evil intent
Betrayal between the lines
I have stepped outside the circle
Better off without
Choking on sand and sorrow
Visions from the suffocated

In this Universe where the fire roars Endlessly
Peace will never come to reconstruct me
Mine is gone

6. Essence
The question is this
By will alone
Does my heart carry the strength
To see you burn?
When I do not wish to part
To see them farewell
Does my heart carry the strength
To leave you behind?

The eternal search for purity
A fragile hope for the just and fair
Order feeds from the corpses
All beauty must die

Where is the essence
In beast or scripture?
Where lies the laws
In stars or temples?
I cannot see myself
Not your orbit
I cannot see the others
Not your eyes

It lasts forever when you let it go
Purity and Pain

Where is the essence
In beast or scripture?
Where lies the laws
In stars or temples?
I cannot see myself
Not your orbit
I cannot see the others
Not your eyes

If I told you I'd get you through
I'd have to let you fall down

Not because of malice
You needed to
And I'll remember
What we had

It lasts forever when you let it go
Purity and Pain

7. Api-vat
You lie there sleeping
Growing in my mind
A voice from eternity
Awaken now and guide me

Awaken now and guide me
Awaken now and guide me

He turns inward to see
"What might lie ahead?"
Seeing all, but nowhere
"Tell us, will we see the sun again?"

"Waiting is the cost of true vengeance"

Carrying the weight of knowing
"I see darkness, I see evil times"
Time to rise and stand tall again
"The ideals of the One"
I bow to the forefathers
"Towards the Father"
Feeling the transition
"The unity of dimensions"

Leave me not before all fear is gone
Pour into my veins
Let the father become the son,
And I'll keep walking through every winter

I'll keep on walking through every winter
I'll keep on walking through every winter

8. Heir To The Cosmic Seed
Behold the great evening star
As she once again gives birth
Behold the great evening star
As she once again destroys

Behold the shining wife
Of all the howling winds
She arrives when you despair
Behold the shining wife

Beware of what the self desires
She could smile if she removed
All glory from kings

Beware of the heir of cosmic fertility
Her splendour can cut you deep
Her eyes can burn the fields.

1. Ethica Odini
Reckless man - So righteous, so clean
Towards the light - So bashful, so pure

Who told you to abandon life
Your strength, free will
And bow for the light?
The light! And turn from the spinning wheel

Fear of the judgement!
Obey!

[Ref:]
You have the key to mystery
Pick up the runes; unveil and see
Judgement comes, before us lie
The paths of war and you may die
You have the key, cross over and see
The old and wind-cold tree
Walk the steps and you'll hear the winds that cry

Search beyond the blinded eyes
Listen before you preach
Don't leave yourself behind

Honorlife, when life has ceased
Welcome the dawn

Beware the glory tales

Watch their deeds - So just and fair
Crusaders - Appointed by God

Who told you step inside and preach?
Did you forget the daggers lurking in the dark?
Couldn't you listen or didn't you ever learn how?
Were you saved?
Were you saved, so you could slaughter with grace?

[Ref:]
You have the key to mystery
Pick up the runes; unveil and see
Judgement comes, before us lie
The paths of war and you may die
You have the key, cross over and see
The old and wind-cold tree
Walk the steps and you'll hear the winds that cry

Search beyond the blinded eyes
Listen before you preach
Don't leave yourself behind

Honorlife, when life has ceased
Welcome the dawn

Beware the glory tales

Hold on, don't fade away
Don't be afraid to bleed
Don't be afraid to dream

Let the elders enlighten the path
They have cried for you
They have died for you

Drasill - Ride on
Drasill - Ride on
Ride on
Drasill

2. Raidho
This journey without movement
Heading out for no-man's land
The way ahead my only ally
Early hours, in the silence

This credence keeps me upright
Through the storms and disasters
A straight line towards the unknown end
Deceit waits on the back roads

This unwavering inner
Keeps fear a welcomed pointer
I, uprooted, now the fertile soil
As plot and shadows thicken

This juggernaut cannot be stopped
On any scale or planet
Ghostly tracks in my wake and ahead
An experience, cannot be shared

[Ref:]
Wheels of time
Keep them turning
Carriage of concepts
Circling the planes

Lightless voyage, blinding speeds
Certain; I'll stay the distance
Abstract shapes, enigmatic design
I know enough to endure

Lightless corridors, ageless
Familiar
Alien
Contradictory engines run high
Deeper and further above

Journey of no promises
Beyond the lust for rewards
Focus on the movement of the Wheel
Union of stillness and change

Journey of the ages all
I'll follow outside the edge
Breath, blood, sacrifice and bleeding eyes
Unending journey ahead

[Ref:]
Wheels of time
Keep them turning
Carriage of concepts
Circling the planes

3. Waruun
See them as they rise
From ancient sands - constructs
They're reaching everywhere and nowhere
As they're trampling on the archetypes
The listener warns

Tension... Pain... Fear... Violence

It reaches the limit set by
Ageless reason
Tension paints logic's hunts
Pain dances... (with justice)

Lies for the liar served without remorse
Like the gifts bring gifts
Altering view

Constant truth - drained of spirit
By own will

[Ref:]
Waruun
Waruun - Drawn in the dust of morning
Waruun - The violence of the soul

Suicides upon the altars
Of evasion

Feared dissonance kept away - nails on stone
As darkness descends
Can't find our way out of here
Yet... It was built by you
Words on the trap-door

[Ref.:]
Waruun
Waruun - Drawn in the dust of morning
Waruun - The violence of the soul

Tension... Pain... Fear... Violence

How could freedom become the cage-maker?
What spoke to the mind-slayer?

4. The Beacon
To war!
Let the havoc be revenged

March!

Against the lords of perdition

Live!
Breathe!

Persecute the ones that left to persecute your soul
Crush the scepters of the kings and come and
Hail the vows of old!

[Ref:]
Hear them cry
Watch them fly
Let them bow to the altars of suppression
Till you'll feel them die

Hear them cry
Watch them fly
The power and the free will they deny

Beyond the mist
Far above
On the highest peak
The beacon is lit
On the highest peak
The beacon will burn

How did I get this far?
How did it come to this?
Was my blood spilt in vain?
Did I survive, did I break the chains?
Was I ever alive?

Struggle through the wounds
Struggle through the fears
Struggle through the truths
You stand alone

Come through!
Release me!

[Ref:]
Hear them cry
Watch them fly
Let them bow to the altars of suppression
Till you'll feel them die

Hear them cry
Watch them fly
The power and the free will they deny

Beyond the mist
Far above
On the highest peak
The beacon is lit
On the highest peak
The beacon will burn

I walked this far myself
My blood dripped from my knife
I awoke, and was alive
I did no longer weep
I saw my beacon, I ran to aid

5. Axioma
"Mind not the worshippers of punishment,
Un-growers and resisters"

Close your eyes, sense the below
Torment and separation points ahead
Set ablaze like steel through skin

"Fear not the settlement with those who fear the truth"

Leave now, bid farewell with no grief
Their words have no power
The forces will roam and return

6. Giants
No distance, no time
Endless void, absence of life
Chaos dwells outside the womb
Seduce, Invoke
Embrace, Give birth

See through the flesh
See past the soul
Feel the pulsating twilight
Domain of unborn thoughts
Go back, Unveil
Approach the cosmic womb

No smile without pain
No grief without laughter

[Ref.:]
Turn inwards, Realize
Witness the march of the Giants
-Soil and seed
Turn inwards, Gratify
Witness the storming of heaven
-Endless rebirth

Come nearer, Restless sin
Step into the core
They will welcome your return
Further in
Ride the storm one can't escape

Awake the Gods
Awake the Gods

[Ref.:]
Turn inwards, Realize
Witness the march of the Giants
-Soil and seed
Turn inwards, Gratify
Witness the storming of heaven
-Endless rebirth

7. Singular
Born into oblivion
Without the fear
-of existing all alone

Later comes the acquisition - forced upon
The solitude
Now loneliness
The god now submerged in a game of guilt

Psychopathic shepherds deny the miracle
-of our essence
...And yet we have part in the blame

Allowing their ravings,
Comforting their weakness, their sickness
It is time to
LIVE
TRUST
NO
ONE

Recognize black
Recognize white
Recognize shadows
I am with gods

...Black...White...Shadows...Gods

Recognize black
Recognize white
Recognize shadows
I am with gods

Traitors want to keep you down
Rise up from the ground

No-one steals what no-one owns
Disown and distance

Strong is she who realizes
Ethics built on sacrifice

No-one steals what no-one owns

One by one by one

Strong is she who realizes
Ethics built on sacrifice

No need for companionship
Back into the silence
It is all it needs
Desolation

Singular - Death - Birth
Singular - Birth - Death

Alone in birth
Alone in the darkness
Alone in death
Alone in the daylight

One with reality
Shaped by the inner glow
Determination - I
All can be reached from within

Born into oblivion
Without the fear
-of existing all alone

Later comes the acquisition - forced upon
The solitude
Now loneliness
The god now submerged in a game of guilt

Psychopathic shepherds deny the miracle
-of our essence
...And yet we have part in the blame

Allowing their ravings,
Comforting their weakness, their sickness
It is time to
LIVE
TRUST
NO
ONE

Recognize black
Recognize white
Recognize shadows
I am with gods

8. Night-sight
I can see through the veil
Seeing all I need see
Nothing is hidden here
Deep into the woods

Casting
Letters that speak of...
All
Is all
Is naught

No-one but me
Knows of this place
Sanctuary
Where I construct

Dream while there is no strife
Anguish pulls no weight
One can see and the other is blind
Through the same pair of eyes

We have lost sight
Of the night-side of the self
Hunted by the fear
Of reunion
Night-sight is bliss
For he who dares look into
A world where you embrace the opposite
Where you are whole

There is no lasting joy
In numbness and dogma
Too much is too little in knowledge
Driven by mystery

We have lost sight
Of the night-side of the self
Hunted by the fear
Of reunion
Night-sight is bliss
For he who dares look into
A world where you embrace the opposite
Where you are whole

9. Lightening
I crossed the borders
The pain won't go away

For this treason, I want to see them ... Burn!
Hunt them down
Make them understand
The power I possess

I'll give you piece of mind
And freedom to search inside

I'll suffer for your souls

I cleaned the air
I slew death in your way
The hand of peace
All evil's great dismay

Hear the wheels turn
See the sky burns

For this treason, I want to see them... Burn!
Track them down
Bring them to silence
My will is the law

I'll bring you life and growth
And erase the memories of despair

I'll suffer for your needs

Don't you forget where your domain lies
Obey your slaves, with their feeble cries
We'll force you back if you linger here
We mock your strength, we see your fear
You'll never set a slave's mind free
Your bane is the grip of anxiety

At the ninth...

REID - Travel with no fear
REID - Remember to return
REID - Defy the laughing chaos
REID - Strike again

You fight the wars for your kin
You leave yourself behind
This settlement, you can't win
The inner eye is blind

I will clean the air
I know the pain will stay
I'll cross the border
I'll never fade away

For this treason, I want to see them... Burn!
Track them down
Bring them to silence
My will is the law

I'll bring you life and growth
And erase the memories of despair

I will linger on

1. Clouds
In the void of chaos life endures
In the gap of creation, the ancient wisdom breathes

Inheritance of fire
Inheritance of frost
Yet it lay there weeping
Afraid to see the light

Inheritance of fire
Inheritance of frost
No one comes to unveil
No one finds the key

Inheritance of fire
Inheritance of frost
Grasp the mighty chaos
Grasp the ancient birth

Seek deep within, feel the flames
Into the void, never to return
Seek deep within, fertilize
Into the void, rise...

Struggling against the fumes
Poisoning the hearts
Fighting the chains, to penetrate the clouds
Pulsating life in the ancient womb
Encapsulated in forces of old

Waiting to hear the call
To witness the cosmic marriage
Willing to blow; to blow the mocking clouds away

2. To The Coast
To the coast, but not across
Static sanctuary

Longing for the heart of the changer
Chained to the past, a dream of liberation
The vultures above, they know, they've seen him linger here
Where the barren land meets sea; the mother and the reaper
The irony of...
Sorrow kept close
Hanging head
Gaze upon the waters and turn back again
Like so many times before

Riders on the horizon with darkness in tow

Too painful to let go of the fear, too strong the ties
He came without a face
...And a promise of belonging
So I caved and gave way to this vision
Bleak and never-ending the pages
I'd like to see what lies beyond
Dissolving ink in salt water
Wrecked and laughing at the skies and the open sea

To the coast but not across
Had some strange days then walked back
To the coast but not across

Longing for the heart of the changer
Chained to the past, a dream of liberation
The vultures above, they know, they've seen him linger here
Where the barren land meets the sea; the mother and the reaper
The irony of...

Riders on the horizon with darkness in tow

Too painful to let go of the fear, too strong the ties
He came without a face
...And a promise of belonging
So I caved and gave way to this vision
Bleak and never-ending the pages
I'd like to see what lies beyond
Dissolving ink in salt water
Wrecked and laughing at the skies and the open sea

Black clad back into the all over again

3. Ground
The defining sound

Fangs into flesh
Panic and spit
Death unto life
Eyes wide

It sees itself through the layers of ice
Now; seal the cracks ... reject the notions!
Everything can not be happening on the inside?

An option not to listen

A nameless urge takes hold
Prey upon the weak
An aimless tale told
Pray upon the weak

Caught in a spiral of need
Act without the choice
Choose not to act
Caught in a spiral of need

Desperate and alone in a whole
Striving for higher ground
Carrying someone else's fears for tomorrow
Stay behind the line
Or eat from the bowels of reality
Grind the thorns to stardust
Gliding slowly across the abyss
Inside the inside the inside

There is a sound made by boiling blood

Above and below lay the levels
Above and below the ground
Ground

4. Vertebrae
"Abandoning the powers that gave them sight
Summoned to the altars of their loving gods"

Storming the walls, once built with pride
Swarming like rats away from the lights
Howling for justice, death in their eyes
Tearing down the pillars with monstrous hate

Forging the swords to slay their own kin
Screaming in triumph, burning inside

When the steps are fulfilled
We shall see a new dawn
When the dead world is gone
We shall rebuild the walls

When all the bricks from the morning
When they are once again found
We will emerge from the ashes
And rise from the ground

5. New Dawn
In the radiant night
Beneath the fertile soil
In every heart it lies sleeping
Hiding in dreams of strength
Older than the mountains
So ancient and profound
Beyond the grasp of reason
Above the laws of man

The ancient gods of battle
Summoned by the drums of war
In circles of fire descended
Our eyes and minds frantic
At the point of no return
I never saw her shine so bright
Returning the strength to a weary heart
Strife to reclaim and expand

A new dawn rises
Out from the shadows
A new dawn rises
I step unto the world

In times when truth has lost its valour
In times when fate is bought and sold
When honour lays slain at vanity's feet
It seemed like our last hour had come
The enemies' name outspoken
They will tremble upon seeing the sign
The second coming has no mercy
Forged in the flames with iron will

A new dawn rises
Out from the shadows
A new dawn rises
I step unto the world

6. Reflection
Clinging to life in the reflection of the self
Breathing the air from the poisoned pit
Hovering through flames from the burning core

Searching for reason in the ashes of men
Obeying the laws of the kings without lands
Bowing in awe at the hypocrite's feet
Not hearing the cry of the infant

Poisoning the seed that was planted within
Ignoring the winter that closes in
Believing the tales from the forked tongue
Frozen to death without being born

Looking for reason in the bottomless abyss

Clinging to life in the reflection of the self
Breathing the air from the poisoned pit
Hovering through flames from the burning core

Searching for reason in the ashes of men
Obeying the laws of the kings without lands
Bowing in awe at the hypocrite's feet

Clinging to life
Frozen to death

Clinging to life in the reflection of the self
Frozen to death without being born

Absorbing the reek of rotting Flesh
Marching in convoys to fields unknown

Clinging to life in the reflection of the self
Embracing the sun without casting shadows

Believing the tales from the forked tongue
Frozen to death without being born.

7. Center
Feel nothing
Oxen and primate as one
Pushing what already strives
(There is) no space
(There is) no peace
Let go of the whip

We've reached the outer limits of this orchestrated vision
Some might think it can't be kept apart
Forgot to ask: where are we in all of this?
Trying to get off track ... Into the wilderness
Running from the beast

In need of strength, in search of guidance
Asked but given nothing - remembering everything
It matters not now, it all came to fuel
Silent growth
Hoarse rust
Can not be broken
I trust the shapes
Heathen vertigo
Repaint the curses and bellow
Sailing past to old shores
In the distant haze

The waving motion
Is not for you

In every direction stretched and torn no more
(It) seems we've been here all along

8. The Watcher
Darkness...
Fear...
Life...
Cold...

Left alone with no will
Walking in footsteps of the fallen
Blinded by lack of reason
Indulging the tales of doom

...Farewell,
May the darkness bind them
No one will
Remember the pain when we are...

Desolate...
Unconscious...
Lost...

Where lays the ones I've slain?
Did I become any wiser?
Will their anger hunt me down?
Did I sacrifice in vain?

...Farewell,
Hear the sound of solitude
No one will
Walk the bridge, to darkness overcome

Settlement...
Trust...
Relief...
Dawn...

Guide me, watcher in the skies
Transform the forces of the dead
In my dreams I'll hunt them down
I now know the truth

1. Disintegrator
Separate
The frenzied infant
From mother
Her bosom bleeding
She needs sleep

Separate
The frenzied infant
From his mother
Her bosom bleeding
She needs sleep

Take him to the woods
Leave him there
The dogs will feast
The dogs will know him

Disintegrate
Disintegrate
Disintegrate
Disintegrate

2. Striker
From soar to plague
From clouds to imprisonment
From wheat to the gallows
In dreams of free will
Strike

Never saw fields
Quite like these
Never will Never would
With open eyes
Shut

Useless wreckage
In the wake
Cannot hear the chatter
Cannot bear the drag
Leave

When they saw
With what they were left
They screamed in fear
They screamed for blood
Endure

Should I build
I will build my own
Knife and noose
In flesh and will
Strike

1. Thoughts Like Hammers
Celestial buried mind resting
Resting without peace still
Don't know where I drowned

Cornered and defeated
Yes, there's a thought forming
Patterns in the currents
Mud-dwellers at the star-floor

Nourishment for the mind seeps
Harvest through suffering
Absorbed in desperation

Assimilated logic
Drawn towards the ladders
Elucidated, burned, afraid
Instinctive destruction sparked
Elucidated, burned, afraid
Knowing only my own dissent
Elucidated, burned, afraid
Static is the common language
Elucidated, burned, afraid

Celestial buried mind resting
Resting without peace still

Assimilated logic
Drawn towards the ladders
Elucidated, burned, afraid
Instinctive destruction sparked
Elucidated, burned, afraid
Knowing only my own dissent
Elucidated, burned, afraid
Static is the common language
Elucidated, burned, afraid

Motion remains our mothertongue
Failure might not be what it seems
All is broken for a reason
Familiar blood drawn for painting
Willing another perspective
Flashing scenes seeing children above

Knowing there will be another life
Sacrificing
Sacrificing remnants of the past
Walking all on my own forever
The illusion no longer needed

It is spoken without words of doubt
Now we move the stars above, below

And dwell beneath the layers of dirt
My runic patterns in the current

My runic patterns in the current

Motion remains our mothertongue
Failure might not be what it seems
All is broken for a reason
Familiar blood drawn for painting
Willing another perspective
Flashing scenes seeing children above

2. Death In The Eyes Of Dawn
The creation I can't remember
Unsecure I roam in fear
The final steps I've taken
What waits beyond this void?

"I sucked out your lifeblood
Tore down your fortress
Burned down the woods
I poisoned your harvest"

Trust and hope
I have lost
I see death
In the eyes of dawn
Deceit
Forged in the darkened depths of the womb
Seeds of betrayal planted in rotten soil

The ground swells
It's the end
I see the face
Of the dead god
Legions of the dead
Invading our realm
Forever deaf to the distant warning

Blinded are my eyes
Tied are my hands
Sleeping wide awake
Got lost within myself

I followed all the paths
Rigtheous in my heart
Slept without the dreams
Got lost within myself

When will I remember?
When will I hear the call?
When shall my forces gather?
When shall my battle begin?

"I've insulted your life since birth
You have never seen my true face
You failed to realize I'm your kin
I infected your mind when you smiled"

Awake!

The grip of anxiety
Shall strangle the brave no more

The son of earth and wind
Shall guide us in our wake

"You might hear the horn resound
You might summon back your king
As long as you love, I will hate
As long as you breed, I will kill"

Blinded are my eyes
Tied are my hands
Sleeping wide awake
Got lost within myself

I followed all the paths
Rigtheous in my heart
Slept without the dreams
Got lost within myself

3. Veilburner
Finding the truth doesn’t mean there’s an answer
Who would have thought? It seems worthless.
There’s no end to the travesty, idiocy,
It would seem I’ve arrived at the meeting point
Between then and now, a different place
The past alive, and the future is now

I can not tolerate being held in the dark
I need to see, I will the flames
Expanding light, from within a cube of darkness
I need to see, I will the flames
I found myself crawling, looking for an “out”
And made the gap no longer closed anymore
’cause my signs are burning, burning the veil
Killing our idols, scaring ourselves as well
Necessity, carer/killer
We’re all gonna see, we weren’t prepared

I can not tolerate being held in the dark
I need to see, I will the flames
Expanding light, from within a cube of darkness
I need to see, I will the flames
I found myself crawling, looking for an “out”
And made the gap no longer closed anymore
’cause my signs are burning, burning the veil
Killing our idols, scaring ourselves as well
Necessity, carer/killer
We’re all gonna see, we weren’t prepared

Grasping the liquid glass
Shaping my own sight
Staring at the sun
Absorbing death
Reach into the well
Where father laid his eye

4. Roots Of The Mountain
Approaching life
From the seeds of time
Cosmic pulse
Aeons of chaos

Feel the flames, the streams of life below
Feel the flames, that blind your inner eye
Seek and find, what lingers deep inside
Seek and find, but do not try to understand
Spread the wings, and fly into your mind
Spread the wings, and find the eagle in the sky
Find the source, the ancient passion play
Find the source, the roots of the mountain

Hark, men of faith
Where were you
When your children bled to death?
Listen, men of law
Where were you when the mothers were slain?

Feel the flames, the streams of life below
Feel the flames, that blind your inner eye
Seek and find, what lingers deep inside
Seek and find, but do not try to understand

Hark, men of faith
When you set fire to the fields,
The grass grew stronger
Listen, men of law
When you turned from life,
The flames endured
Leave order, the fiend of the earth
The self is all you've got
Enter life on the waves from the void
Behold the ancient roots
And the battles shall forever go on
With peace comes our certain doom
The mother will love as she hates
Where there is life, you will die

Approaching life
Aeons of chaos
Feel the flames, the streams of life below
Feel the flames, that blind your inner eye
Seek and find, what lingers deep inside
Seek and find, but do not try to understand
Spread the wings, and fly into your mind
Spread the wings, and find the eagle in the sky
Find the source, the ancient passion play
Find the source, the roots of the mountain

5. RIITIIR
Your arms, life and death
Ride the chariot, the wheel of life
Underneath the eyes we pray

Seven horses running in circles until the end of days
Above the wonders of man, sailing the cosmic seas
Risen from the darkness to rule the ancient world
Never to return, the eyes will forever shine on

Omniscient, glorious - the all seeing eye
Malign, burning grace
All rise! The seeds you will bring
Sons of man, bow in awe

Omnipotent, Lumina Titan
In the havens you greeted us
Late is the hour you submerge
Endless travel towards the dawn

Hail the flames inside you, cosmic flowers in bloom
Hail the spears impaling, the servants of doom
Given are the truths, together we shall search
Unveiling the riddles, hidden beneath the stones

Left is an ancient entity
Ready to sacrifice, what we may (have) achieved
Ending a journey with no end

Defying the ones drowned in salvation
Letting the forces roam free
A circle fulfilled

6. Materal
See her cruel beauty
Hostile to the constants
Ever changing scourge
Ashen thrones
Converge upon me
Come winds of destruction
Electrocute the stale
Purify

Thaw! False ice to water
Speak! Sharp tongues sever sick limbs
Numb! Do not look away
Opt! Permanent particles

Curtains be unshut
Old wounds opened and bled
Wishes laid to rest
Ashen hopes
Reflections of truth
Drops of eternity
Instances captured
Clarify

Etch! New shapes will emerge
Need! Reaching into the dark
Owe! I opened the gates
Roar! O', devourer of time

There's this chamber
Randomly placed in time and space
Echo chamber
Achievable dream
Capacitate
Heuristic observers might find
Ends to the means
Rain is less scarce there

You heeded my call - now read my signs
And chose to follow
Dominate slavelessly
Enter my thoughts,
And walk with me throughout these barren lands
Aligning wordlessly
Tell me my own story,
Through the inner and nether worlds
Healing accordingly
Into the night side, irreversible and remorseless
Slaughterous and reborn
Hagalaz!

End the charade!
Return to the wombs
A funeral lost
Baptize the faceless
Light up the beacons
End the hunt for truth!
Time to break it down
Owe nothing to trees
Nullify the past

Enter the maternal fires
Entropy
Deter rot within the roots
Nourisher
Old fears no longer controls
Negation
Enter maternal fires
Xiphoid dreams

I close the gate!
Silence the voices
Take to heart the fear
And nourish the pain
Nothing can hurt us
Called upon the mare
Ended the sham reign
These forces in tow
Endlessness opens

Ashen memories
Retain the images
In need of her strength
Time changes
Death is encountered
Over and over again
Worship her pyres
Navigate

7. Storm Of Memories
In the land described as the beyond
In lack of better directional insight
Something stirs and leaps
Casual roads of reason intersect
Conceptual wormholes in the lawless black
In ancient matter

Unknown kin, as they thoroughfare
Unexplored utopia lineage
Accumulation
Icebergs of the abyss never melts
Ideal energy, it's building within
Unlike loyalty

Cadaverous and spirited; I work
Composite and uniform; I sacrifice
Resist the wisdom
With limited perception we see
We learn, and we laugh, and we sleep,
And we watch
Logic is worthless

Storm of the ions, ecstatic mind
Seeps through the cracks, it fills up the bones
I remember now
The here and the now - it is nothing
...This Eve - haunted by a storm of memories
Immortality

Then it was quiet, then it was dark
Trees, dreams, and the runes
Makes for a future
I'm on the inside
Looking at the sky, I think of you
Life is a room, in between the greater halls
There we'll met again

I can't make out what is what is what
In this storm of memories
Now it all comes back
I know there's strength in my blood
I can hear the past
Fearing not
Time has come... listen
There's a storm
Within
Storm of the ions, ecstatic mind
Seeps through the cracks, it fills up the bones
I remember now
The here and the now - it is nothing
...This Eve - haunted by a storm of memories
Immortality

Then it was quiet, then it was dark
Trees, dreams, and the runes
Makes for a future
I'm on the inside
Looking at the sky, I think of you
Life is a room, in between the greater halls
There we'll met again

Unknown kin, as they thoroughfare
Unexplored utopia lineage
Accumulation
Icebergs of the abyss never melts
Ideal energy, it's building within
Unlike loyalty

Cadaverous and spirited; I work
Composite and uniform; I sacrifice
Resist the wisdom
With limited perception we see
We learn, and we laugh, and we sleep,
And we watch
Logic is worthless

8. Forsaken
Forsaken
Entombed in monumental self-moral
Embracing the absurd
Reason turned to abstraction
Drowned in the shallowest of waters

Forgotten the will
To learn
Abandoned every urge to
Create
Every border can be breached
By the glorious armies of united perfection

Marching forth
Aiming low
A thirst to kill
Defending the nothingness

Forsaken
The unborn learns to hate
Navigation towards destruction
Letting our ideals slowly rot

And thus...
Thus we choose
To die...
Die with pride
And innocence...

We became the heralds
Born and raised to preach
And to erase all traces
Of the abstract and evil

Swords...
Temples...
Fires...
Doom...
We failed to see what we fed
The serpent of the deeps
It grew and strangled the truths
We were embracing the lies
We once could see its eyes
The stare of death and deceit
We feared not, the secrets we knew
The guardian of the deeps

Lost...
And the darkness will prevail
Forever...
Folding hands with clouded sight
Ceremonial rituals will obscure the mind
Forever...

Lost...
And turning blossom to decay
Forever...
Fighting wars with clouded sight
Ceremonial rituals will obscure the mind
Forever...

1. One Thousand Years of Rain
[performed by Enslaved]The age of the wolf is the age of the sword

Son of the earth, father of despair, lurking
And ever searching to end his thirst
Strength reborn in the streams of cold blood
Son of the earth, father of rage, hiding beneath
And ever smiling when the seed is planted
Hate paving the streets of gold

Long gone is the golden grace
Feeble beats from a frozen heart
Now glowing eyes in the pale face
The blind man cries in vain
Long gone is the light of day
Searching the borders of sanity
The children of tomorrow they slay
Their spirits entombed in rotten soil

Son of the earth, father of anxiety, amongst us
And ever telling the tales of the righteous
Licking drops of sorrow from the lake of tears
Son of the earth, father of treason, envy the beauty
And ever embracing the desperation
Hiding from the moonbeams, afraid to face the wrath
Wandering down the icy path
The sun is dying
The mother is crying
No sadness found in the jester’s face
The sun is dying
The mother is crying

Long gone is the golden grace
Feeble beats from a frozen heart
Now glowing eyes in the pale face
The blind man cries in vain
Long gone is the light of day
Searching the borders of sanity
The children of tomorrow they slay
Their spirits entombed in rotten soil

The winter is closing in
Like the grip of a war within
Absence of light turning flesh to stone
A cosmic war and you stand alone

Brother killing brother
Tales of honor becoming myth
History written with axes and blood
The wolf is howling at the gate

Bræðr munu berjask
(Ok at) bönum verðask,
Munu systrungar
Sifjum spilla
Leika Míms synir
(En) mjötuðr kyndisk
At inu galla Gjallarhorni

Skelfr Yggdrasils
Askr standandi
Ymr it aldna tré
Hræðask allir
(Á helvegum)
(Áðr Surtar þann
Sefi of gleypir

Wandering down the icy path
The sun is dying
Silent tears won’t bring him back
No sadness found in the jester’s face
The mother is crying
Breach the walls, relieve the pain, or be left in one thousand years of rain

2. Ægirs armar
[performed by Enslaved]
3. Immigrant Song
[performed by Enslaved]
[originally by Led Zeppelin]Ahhh-ah-ah! Ahhh-ah-ah!

We come from the land of the ice and snow
From the midnight sun where the hot springs blow
Hammer of the gods will drive our ships to new lands
To fight the horde and sing and cry
Valhalla, I am coming

On we sweep with the threshing oar
Our only goal will be the western shore

Ahhh-ah-ah! Ahhh-ah-ah!

We come from the land of the ice and snow
From the midnight sun where the hot springs blow
How soft your fields so green can whisper tales of gore
Of how we calmed the tides of war
We are your overlords

On we sweep with the threshing oar
Our only goal will be the western shore

So now you'd better stop and rebuild all your ruins
For peace and trust can win the day despite of all your losing

Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh

Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh

Returning from the exile with their message clear
Keepers of a secret shadow things are near
They only offer you and me eternal life
Look within my friend 'cause it's time to decide

4. Baptised In Fire
In a cavern- Of deep despair
All alone- surrounded by stone

The serpent's poison - Searing the skin
A flicker of light - The pyre grows bright

He took the revenge
He fed the flame
Forever in rapture
Forever reign

Baptised in fire
Born within the flame

Thoughts so hollow - Take on a new meaning
His mission apprears - No longer be hallow, my son

Still searching for a meaning
A search that will be in vain
Disquised and denial
Your crippled life will end in pain

Bolt of lightning
Striking you down
The price of lying
Eternal flame

Now in ever mounting terror
You pay the dues of your betrayal
Vengeance's soaring high now
Nowhere to hide no one is spared

Crushing power
Boiling blood
The call of thunder
Grim sacrifice

Rain coming down
Chaos all around
You will all be devoured alive
You've become
The food of the Gods

Sail!

7. He Who Seeks Shall Find
Now aligned - Three signs of fire
No longer blind - Or choked by liars

I've been redeemed
My eyes can see

Fear and doubt - Just passing feelings
Time has come - To speak of healing
Crush the walls - And killl denial
One must try - It's no illusion

He who seeks - shall find
He who seeks - never blind

Burning their eyes
Laugh with delight

Black star in sight
Giving my life
Living to fight
Giving my life

2. Legion
A mighty blast of fire burned across the sky
It is no unknown power causing this tonight
They didn't know I had it in me but I have returned
Transformed, no longer human, watch the heavens burn

You'll pay

They hear the hooves thundering, raising up a storm
He comes with vengeance seething, breaking up the calm
Been called a traitor and a fool so many times
From now on all apposing men will fear the sign

Twisting, turning, riding across the plain
Creating a river of blood, bringer of pain
The god of war, destroyer of all in his reign
Legion's the name called by the toll of bell

Been called a traitor and a fool so many times
From now on all apposing men will fear the sign

Creating a river of blood, bringer of pain
The god of war, destroyer of all in his reign
Legion's the name called by the toll of bell

3. Never Learned
I have been told
Why I can't grow old
I never learned
To stay away
When the water churns

Alright

No matter what your gold

Never learned

Cause I never learned

Never learned

Cause I never learned

4. Black Hound Of Vengeance
Got firm belief in what's to come
Your treacherous ways leave me cold and numb
No magic circle will save you now
Your scent's been picked up by my wish to strike

You try to hide behind a veil of smoke
To summon petty demons, will not work
Cause my familiar has searched you out
To make you pay for all the pain I took

You'll learn the way of -
The Black Hound Of Vengeance
You'll learn the way of -
The Black Hound Of Vengeance

5. Coat Of Arms
A glade became the setting
Must have been about noon
Grass so green and tender
Ripped apart by steel clad boots

Mid-day's sun reflected
In weapons sharp as steel
Grim determination
One shall die and one shall live

And the dawn became the winner
Sun and moon will rise again
Coat of arms shine and shimmer
A king has been crowned

Now the wounds are open
Blood engulfing all
Ready for the gauntlet
One will stand and one will fall

And the dawn became the winner
Sun and moon will rise again
Coat of arms shine and shimmer
A king has been crowned

And the dawn became the winner
Sun and moon will rise again
Coat of arms shine and shimmer
A king has been crowned

Alright

6. Generator
Like a lead-heavy generator
Just pushing everything aside
I took my pill and now I feel alright

Like a wheel dead-set on moving
Perpetual bliss in sight
I took my fill and now I feel alright

Oh yeah, I feel alright
Believe me I feel just fine
Oh yeah, I feel alright

Got no restraining shackles
Just a highway stretching far and wide
The sun shines down and feeds me with what I need

There ain't nobody waiting
I'm free to do whatever I please
I've flipped the coin and now I will be seen

Yeah, I will be seen
I'm coming out, I'm coming clean
Oh yeah I will be seen
I will be mean
Emerald, emerald eyes rising from the tomb
No, no quarter in sight, generator of light

Emerald, emerald eyes rising from the tomb
No, no quarter in sight, now you meet your doom
Emerald, emerald eyes prepare for your undoing
No, no quarter in sight, generator of light

Oh come on
Yeah

7. Wheel Of Time
Wheel of time rotating ever onward
Nothing new and nothing has been learned
The same mistakes still repeated every time
A pleasant ignorance rules the crooked line

Stand back and face your terrible fate
Your soul has been circumscribed
And your body will just wither away

Time to wake from your non-creative slumber
Seasons change but still you stay the same
A crushing blow's going to force your decision
You realize that there is no prize for you

Stand back and face your terrible fate
Your soul has been circumscribed
And your body will wither away

Roll on, wheel of time
Roll on, just crush and grind
Roll on, wheel of time
Roll on, wheel of time!
Yeah

Roll on, wheel of time
Roll on, just crush and grind
Roll on, wheel of time
Roll on, wheel of time!

8. Lodbrok
Sacrifice
The only way to be sure
To rid the land
Of the plague that's been haunting us all
Restoring our faith
In the axe and the sword

Slaves for so long
Our minds filled up with their lies
Now the Christian cross
Forever erased from our eyes

Rejoice all free men
Betrayer, run if you can

Rejoice all free men
Betrayer, run if you can

Run if you can
Run if you can
Run if you can
RUN IF YOU CAN

9. Black Hole
All that I want, give me just what I need
What I've been told ain't exactly what I've seen
I'll just lay low here for the time being
Even though I risk falling in that Black Hole

Now that I have seen all that there is in this land
I've proven my worth to my fellow man
I'll just take a backseat to what's going on
Even though I risk falling in that Black Hole

Selling my soul
No remainder for the fools
Losing all control
All that is, is the wind of my soul
In that Black Hole
Black Hole
Black Hole
Black Hole

Now that I have seen all that there is in this land
I've proven my worth to my fellow man
I'll just take a backseat to what's going on
Even though I risk falling in... alright!

Selling my soul
No remainder for the fools
Losing all control
All that is, the wind of my soul, yeah
Black Hole
Black Hole

10. Mountain Of Power
Sure enough can't figure out
Why all that's good is sin
Why people choose to grovel at
The feet of some dreamed up king

Too scared to fight their own way
So easy to be sheep
Alive but dead inside
Holier than thou

Condemning all around them
They're the chosen ones
Now hypocrisy's king
Defiling everything
And at judgement's hour crumble, yeah
Crumble you mountain of power

Still signs of hope are many
Reason covers ground
Two thousand years of twisted lies
Soon just a burial mound

Too scared to fight their own way
So easy to be sheep
Alive but dead inside
Holier than thou

Condemning all around them
They're the chosen ones
Now hypocrisy's king
Defiling everything
And at judgement's hour crumble, yeah
Crumble you mountain of power

Now hypocrisy's king
Defiling everything
And at judgement's hour crumble, yeah
You mountain of power

Now hypocrisy's king
Defiling everything
And at judgement's hour crumble, yeah
You mountain of power
You mountain of power
Yeah
Mountain of power
Yeah, you mountain of...

1. Kingslayer
Leech of power wanting more as you feed - never satisfied
Crowned usurper wasting time and our wealth - you must go

And we'll see him falling now
Christian ruler die!
See you falling
Kingslayer rise

All false methods you're arrogant and vain - above the law
Your blood is feeble a failing line of heirs - down you go

And we'll see him falling now
Christian ruler die!
See you falling
Kingslayer rise

Kingslayer rise!

And we'll see him falling now
Christian ruler die!
See you falling
Kingslayer rise

2. Nine
Nine, nine days of pain
Been discovering
Nine, reborn again
Wisdom filling him

Wield the sword

Hanged, by free will doomed
Trusting just in strength
Hanged, rewarded soon
Growing tall again

Wield the sword

4. Wolf's Return
Wolf's return - Iron veined
We are joined - Scream my name

They believe - Man rules all
No regard - For grey one's call
Misguided hate - Caused by fear
Blame the hunter - But keep weapons near

He'll return - Standing proud
New blood coursing - Better now
Shadow fighter - Iron veined
Fill my soul - Scream his name

Life - A soulless kiss
We are joined - Scream my name

Wolf's return - Iron veined
We are joined - Scream my name

5. Blood Oath
Living on the edge of darkness
Gives a man a certain point of view
Never shared by you

Raven's hunger will be stilled
Giving back to nature what I hjad
Joy is the fact, I'm never turning back

Living on - Ever on
Blood Oath
Blood Oath
Living on

One for one and all still one
Honour has a price that must be paid
Time to choose your way
Not your fault that you've been blind
But the time to think is now at hand
Every woman, child and man

Blood Oath
Living on

Blood Oath
My oath of blood lives on

Screams - tear the night
No more holding on
Fear - taking flight
Searing sound is born

Piercing your mind
Repaying in kind

I've been released
I've been unleashed
I've called
Now I'm free

I've been released
I've been unleashed
Stealing your mind
Repay in kind

Storm - icy blasts
Ripping through your soul
Eyes - mirthless gaze
Crimson oath is sworn

Piercing your mind
Repaying in kind

I've been released
I've been unleashed
I've been called
Now I'm free

I've been released
I've been unleashed
Stealing your mind
Repay in kind

Laughter dies out - Honest and cold
Life drains away - My last will done

Sowing the seed
Filling the need
Taking the lead
Sowing the seed

Sun sinking down - Twilight sets in
Leaving the cage - My testament

Sowing the seed
Filling the need
Taking the lead
Sowing the seed

Send out the winds - Ashes fill the sky
No more in pain - Defiant as I die

Filling the need
Sowing the seed

Send out the winds - Ashes fill the sky
No more in pain - Defiant as I die

1. On Hooves Of Gold
They are masters of defiance - masters of the wind
Let us fly together - let the change begin
Mountains lie below us - the stars are getting near
All doubt has left my being - strength replacing fear
And they said it's too late - but the bastards will pay

As we ride the wind and fly
On hooves of gold we ride

Consuming without feeling - a hollow life of shame
The elders, well of knowledge - discarded, thrown away
New gods taking over - thievery and false pride
Burn the gifts of nature, laugh at the giver of life
With greed raping the land
They don't even know what they demand, no
And they say it's too late - but the bastards will pay

As we ride the wind and fly
On hooves of gold we ride

Ride the wind - change begin
And they say it's too late
But the bastards will pay

As we ride the wind and fly
On hooves of gold we ride

2. Steel Versus Steel
"I was a thousand times more evil than thou"

Drifting away into dreams of despair
Visions of doom and of dead eyes that stare
Will the end be what you thought - will you escape?
Across the plains you rode as you fled
The lord of chaos put a price on your head
And the black blade at your side won't let you rest

To slay became a trade
Your soul will have to pay
The final fate a clash between the blades

And in the end it's steel versus steel
The final lock and the final key
It's the steel versus steel
A thousand souls won't tame the need
Steel versus steel
The final lock and the final key
Steel versus steel

Skin as white as the full moon at night
Eyes that burn like a red fire light
But the body's still as weak as a newborn child
Tried to rule with mercy inside
Ignore tradition and the dragons will rise
The dreaming city falls - lost in time

To slay became a trade
Your soul will have to pay
The final fate a clash between the blades

'Cause in the end it's steel versus steel
The final lock and the final key
It's the steel versus steel
A thousand souls won't tame the need
Steel versus steel
The final lock and the final key
Steel versus steel

A thousand souls won't tame the need
To slay became a trade
You will travel on the seas of fate
The seas of fate - between the blades
The price to pay - the end of time
The final fate a clash between the blades

And in the end it's steel versus steel
The final lock and the final key
Steel versus steel
A thousand souls won't tame the need
Steel versus steel
The final lock and the final key
Steel versus steel
A thousand souls won't tame the need
It's the steel versus steel
The final lock and the final key - the steel

3. Fight
They forged an alliance - and legions attend
They steal and conspire - all means to an end
Soon they must fall - we'll rise from our crawl
And summon the strength from within

'Cause we will fight for the right to defend
Fight for the right till the end
Conquer and divide
Fight for the right to survive

Through ages of darkness, slavery and pain
The lie they call "progress" - an expanding domain
Soon they must fall - we'll rise from our crawl
And summon the strength from within

And we will fight for the right to defend
Fight for the right 'til the end
Conquer and divide
Fight for the right to survive

Fight with the power of rage
Fight to the end of our age
With fury burning inside
Fight for the right to survive

For too long did we relent
While they stole at our expense
Now the tide has turned
They must fall
and we will rise standing tall

[Solo]

Fight with the power of rage
Fight to the end of our age
With fury burning inside
Fight for the right to survive

Fight for the right to defend
Fight for the right 'til the end
Conquer and divide
Fight for the right to survive

4. Triumph And Power
Room to breathe
Fill my need
Give me space
Plant the seed

Born alone
Slowly grown
There's a strength
In my breed

Now my goal
Has been shown
As I march
'Til dawn

For the triumph and the power
Spoils of war
For the hunger and desire
A blood red throne
I ascend to the sky
By the dawn's early light
Fight for glory until death
Hail victory

Will of iron
Quiet soul
Empty words
Empty roles

Break their walls
Break their rules
Fiercely defiant
Damn the fools

Now my goal
Has been shown
As I march
'Til dawn

For the triumph and the power
Spoils of war
For the hunger and desire
A blood red throne
I ascend to the sky
By the dawn's early light
Fight for glory until death
Hail victory

At last there's a reason to believe
To rise from the depths of misery
My heart clad in iron
My soul clad in steel
The triumph and power achieved

As I march
'Til dawn

For the triumph and the power
Spoils of war
For the hunger and desire
A blood red throne
I ascend to the sky
By the dawn's early light
Fight for glory until death
Hail victory

For the triumph and the power
Spoils of war
For the hunger and desire
A blood red throne
I ascend to the sky
By the dawn's early light
Fight for glory until death
Hail victory

5. Dominator
He made a promise many years ago to break and scorch the land
He had a need for destruction and to bend us to the ground
He swore an oath: To bring us fear and pain
To never bend or rest until it's done - before he had become

The dominator - freedom hater - he will break us, crush our dreams
Amputator - lacerator - spreading madness, mindless hate - dominate

Bringing everlasting pain
So many tragedies and years ago for you to understand
The devastation that he brought will leave a mark until the end
He swore an oath - to bring us fear and pain
To never bend or rest until it's done - before he had become

The dominator - freedom hater - he will break us, crush our dreams
Amputator - lacerator - spreading madness, mindless hate - dominate

He walks alone
He'll put out our fire with scorn
He'll never rest - just enslave us
Destroyer of beasts and of man
Enforcer of madness and pain
He's sworn to break us - the dominator
Born of hate - Crush and break - Annihilate - Dominate
I swore an oath - I will reverse his plan
I will restore - bringing power to the land, but the price is that I am

The dominator - freedom hater - I will bleed you, crush your dreams
Amputator - lacerator - spreading madness, mindless hate - breathing pain

Born of hate - Crush and break - Annihilate – Dominate

7. Holmgång
You're awaiting your turn, jealousy burns - you know you had your chance
Wanting to lead, filling your greed - envy drives your plans
Stole what I made, all that I saved - never letting up
But in the end there can be only one - and justice will be done

Take your light
Got nowhere to run
Bring the fight
You know the time is now
Steal your life
Got nowhere to run
Take your light

Sun in the back when I attack - there is no return
Beckoning time, I know what is mine - only you will burn
In the light of the day you'll finally pay - this is what you learn
In the end there can be only one - and justice will be done

Take your light
Got nowhere to run
Bring the fight
Justice will be done
Steal your life
Got nowhere to run
Take your light
There can be only one
Take your light
Got nowhere to run
Bring the fight
You know the time is now
Steal your life
Got nowhere to run
Take your light

8. The Naked And The Dead
In a flash he turned to stone
Hesitated, lost control
Just a man a dying warrior
Battleground drenched in blood
Bodies flayed down in the mud
Mercy never came on this day

For the naked and the dead
There's no glory or reward to be had
If the spirit travels on it's by will power alone
'Cause the body's just a cell of flesh and blood

While the blood seeps to the ground
There are times you realise
How the pain can change your life
Bragging fools will surely pay the price
No set of rules will end the strife
You have to twist and bend in life
The mind is what defines a warrior

For the naked and the dead
There's no glory or reward to be had
If the spirit travels on it's by will power alone
'Cause the body's just a cell of flesh and blood

For the naked and the dead
There's no glory or reward to be had
And if the spirit travels on it's by will power alone
'Cause the body's just a cell of flesh and blood
While the blood seeps to the ground
Only the chosen one will rise

10. The Hammer Will Bite
The giant arrived, scheming to end Asa rule
Mean as a whip, hard as a rock but a fool
The battle will start at the first light of tomorrow
Jorunheim knew what the thunder would bring

The hammer will bite - no other choice than surrender
Bow to the might - a fiery death from above
The hammer will bite - shattering stone and offenders
Run for your lives - thunder and doom crack the sky
The hammer will bite - you will die

Colossal in size, they built him with magic and clay
Heart from a horse, a fatal mistake for this day
Protector of Asgard never lacked courage
The towering help to the giants will fail

The hammer will bite - no other choice than surrender
Bow to the might - a fiery death from above
The hammer will bite - shattering stone and offenders
Run for your lives - thunder and doom crack the sky
The hammer will bite - you will die

By morning light - the giants die
My death is guaranteed - unless I make him bleed
I can't face him on my own - it's sorcery I need
My help is gone - I'm on my own
My stone is thrown - all is lost

The hammer will bite - no other choice than surrender
Bow to the might - a fiery death from above
The hammer will bite - shattering stone and offenders
Run for your lives - thunder and doom crack the sky
The hammer will bite - you will die
By morning light - the giants die

1. Like The Oar Strikes The Water
Defile your life with religion
And sell your soul
You put all trust in your holy man

You may deny it's illusion
Just worthless rules
You turn away when you thin you can

Corrupting life with suppression
The safest way
You wash your hands in your piety

The winds have turned in your favour
Your time is here
A congregation on a massive scale

But when the night finally falls
And when the truth finally dawns

Just like the oar strikes the water

But when the night finally falls
Yeah when the truth finally dawns

Just like the oar strikes the water

2. Fear Is The Key
Hear crushing thunder
Electrifying storm
Winter is calling
Time to hold one's own

Fear is the weapon
To break the cage of man
Control lies inside me
The terror reveals the plan

Unbeliever, unbeliever
The mind will tell me how
Fear is the key

Last of the shadows
Screaming out my name
Strong determination
A guide through searing flame

Blind Beliver
Choose the easy way
Pray for absolution
You know you've gone astray

When blackest depths will face me
Ask no one's help, to break my fall
Born, dead and free forever
I know that fear is the key

3. Iron Will
Failure - reaching out to greet me
But I will never fall
Aversion - has filled my inner being
But I will never crawl

Obsession - I never fell the pain
Redemption - I will rise again

Again and again

Iron will
I'll never give in or surrender
Iron will
Remind me to always remember

Hatred - it used to feel so easy
Turn away when they call
Craving - driven by the strong need
Alone against them all

Aggression - fuelled by burning hate
Vengeance - I will rise again

Again and again

Iron will
I'll never give in or surrender
Iron will
Remind me to always remember

4. Hövding

5. Silver Into Steel
Time is at hand

Gathering hunger in the night
To feast and to burn
better look for the right of his hands
Summon a feeling of might
Caressed by the dark
The glow of the moon in the eye

Kissing the sweet taste in the air
Embraced by the stars
A home has been found in the end
Time is at hand
Of triumph and sense
A revenge for the times of despair

Silver into Steel

6. The Shadow Knows
The laugh will be the warning
He will break your mental wall
Pulverize resistance
Then sacrifice you all

His solemn promise given
To never be a slave
To stand among the fallen
And fight beyond the grave

The Shadow knows
The Shadow knows
The Shadow knows
The Shadow knows

Stare into the hearts of men
All Misery Treachery

Through Secrecy Mastery Alchemy
Perish in his fire

The wight of procreation
Will never bring him down
Survive humiliation
And laugh when time is gone

The powers of corruption
Will shiver at his gaze
The weed of crime may blossom
But will perish in his flame

The Shadow knows
The Shadow knows
The Shadow knows
The Shadow knows

Stare into the hearts of men
All Misery Treachery

Through Secrecy Mastery Alchemy
Perish in his fire

7. Self-Deceiver
Crowned by minions swearing loyalty
You are selling maps of life

Dar pretender - naked and alone
Self deceiver

Confront
Defeat
Never triumph

Bow down
Submit

Dar pretender - naked and alone

Faking evil, try the best you can

8. Beyond Good And Evil
You smile and claim purity of soul
I feel the need to rise above it all

A burning urge will guide me away
Your black and white will lose to the grey

As i walk - beyond good and evil

Your rules betray your need to make a stand
You fight the herd, still need security

There is no true or false in the world
You might be right but I'm not wrong

As i walk - beyond good and evil

beyond good and evil
good and evil
good and evil
beyond good and evil

9. I Am The North
Joined by the cry of ravens
A chase in the winter cold
First born son of storms
hated and scorned

Free from the cage of morals
Shadow of the ruling kind
The echoes of the savage call
Roll across the land

Truth and lie will join and die
Grey ruler show us how to fight

The Wolf will rise
The end of lies
Corruption dies
Free forever

Burn with the lord of sorrow
Claimed by the shit of nails
Life and death - final breath
Born into the grave

Storm of an ancient fury
Power beyond compare
Serpent's flood - brother's blood
End of times is here

Truth and lie will join and die
Grey ruler show us how to fight

1. I, The Jury
Damnation - their lies used to lead me away
Feeding my desperate heart - with merciless flames
I soon realized there's nothing to gain
And all the dreams that I had had got lost in my pain

I want to learn - I want to see
I'm gonna learn - gonna see - and I'm gonna turn

Because I'm the Law

Wisdom has sprung - and taken my heart
Nothing will stand in my way - I'll tear them apart
Revelation - no one can lead me astra
Follow my own burning path - away from all slaves

I want to learn - I want to see
I'm gonna learn - gonna see - and I'm gonna turn

Because I'm the Law

Riding the teeth of the wind - all barriers part

I want to learn - I want to see
I'm gonna learn - gonna see - and I'm gonna turn

Because I'm the Law

2. Hammer Of The North
Black fire
burns in the twilight
The forest glows
Free heart
passion and defiance
pine and hooded crow
Spring eve
glory of the raven
melt the last of the snow
Gold sparks - set the night afire

It's my joy

Hammer of the North

It's late - silver stars shining - a toast to future goals
Black sky - everlasting beauty - brothers by my side
We smile - nature's celebration - we're fierce yet calm
Gold sparks - set the night afire

It's my joy

We'll learn every secret, we'll trample the cross
We'll curse at the giants, we'll laugh as we toss

Hammer of the North
We believe it's our legacy
Masters of our fate - their logic won't dictate

Their gods will fail - then we rise

Hammer of the North

3. Black Sails
Whipping in the wind
Rule with fear and dreams that tear the light
Sleepless empty nights

A shiver of desperation
Black sails rippling in the wind
Will the dream provide liberation?
Or pain in the end

Haunting dreams of red
Bringing doom - Bringing death
Black sails charge ahead
Rule with dread

Simple life seems hard
Looming shadows
They stalk

A shiver of desperation
Black sails rippling in the wind
Will the dream provide liberation?
Or pain in the end

Haunting dreams of red
Bringing doom - Bringing death
Black sails charge ahead
Rule with dread

The sea turns red
Bringing doom - Bringing death
Black sails charge ahead
Rule with dread

4. Mountains Be My Throne
I'm coming don to the meeting
There's trouble all around
A final push for the silence
The symbol has been shown

Now if I can't wield the power
I'll find another way
Without your guide, will you make it?
Just sheep that go astray

Rising
Watch me climbing
Far away - where nothing binds me
I'm done with all your fighting
Make it known - let mountains be my throne

Rising
Watch me climbing
Far away - where nothing binds me
I'm done with all your fighting
Make it known - let mountains be my throne

Rising
Watch me climbing
Soaring high, the sun won't bind me
I'm done with all your fighting
Make it known - let mountains be my throne

5. Northern Star
Living in denial and never seeing straight or clear
Deep down in your senses you feel that fear
Fear of true alliance, nothing worth the fight
No use standing up when wrong rule what's right

When they bring you despair
Don't resort to prayer

Time for fast decisions
Now it's live or die
Strength is summoned from within
Northern star

Banish the false religions
Learn to stand alone
Nothing up above and no one below
Fear of new beginnings
Like a demon in your soul
You must turn your ear to the beckoning call

When they bring you despair
Don't resort to prayer

Time for fast decisions
Now it's live or die
Weakness spreading like a plague
Will you make the change or stay the same and fail
Strength is summoned from within
Northern star

6. The Lord Of Lies
The lord of lies
He'll steal your life away
And grasp the victor's prize - He's born of fire
He'll claim your soul as pray
The trickster of all time
The lord of lies

Take a deep breath
Watch the forest pull him in
Preparations - Soon the trials will begin

A sacrifice - to make it work he must endure the pain
A conjuring - free the magic, fan the flames again

The lord of lies
He'll steal your life away
And grasp the victor's prize
He's born of fire
He'll claim your soul as pray
The trickster of all time
The lord of lies

Son of giants
Lust and hate is his disguise
Purifier - Naked he'll escape the fires

A sacrifice - to make it work he must endure the pain
A conjuring - free the magic, fan the flames again

The lord of lies
He'll steal your life away
And grasp the victor's prize - He's born of fire
He'll claim your soul as pray
The trickster of all time
The lord of lies

7. At Midnight They'll Get Wise
The barren land lies empty, no enemies in sight
Though no one ever told them, at midnight they'll get wise
As shadow falls upon them,
no one even dares to speak your name

They'll be given the lesson of their lives
Blood and death will follow

As they get wise
To the lies they believed to be real
And they will pay the price by facing the truth and its deal
When they die
At midnight they'll get wise

A shape of hidden power, a presence of true might
Trust in feral knowledge, their fires will die out
Servants to a coward, no one even dares to stand alone

Eyes roll back in terror - the panic starts to rise
Blood and death will follow

As they get wise
To the lies they believed to be real
And they will pay the price by facing the truth and its deal
When they die
At midnight they'll get wise

Watch the hunt-god rise

8. Bond Of Blood
A never ending tale
You lose but never fail
You're going to be the last to learn
To see what's right and wrong
You waited much too long
The truth is somewhere in between
but you've never seen

Now as I burn in fire
You will recall - you will remember my name
Smouldering sea, smoke rises
You'll see the truth
you will be taught by the flames

Bond of blood

Suppose you change your ways
A simple choice to make
You'll be rewarded by yourself
Possessing all that skill
To use at your own will
You better find another way
Or you'll go astray

Now as I burn in fire
You will recall - you will remember my name
Smouldering sea, smoke rises
You'll see the truth
you will be taught by the flames

Bond of blood

9. Savage Tales
See the savage son arrive
striking terror on all sides
He's been waiting all this time
for his reign to come alive

Bite
he will do or die
Fight to hold on, aim for the throne
Bite
he will burn their pride
Rise northern child you've grown

See the iron sky descend
on a world that just pretends
It's a lonely path to walk
but an honor to defend

Those who walk against the wind
will always walk alone

10. Ravens Guide Our Way
We ride endless blackened waves
To  the land of our kin
Snow lords, kings of northern seas
Brought us home again
True hearts gathering up our will
Conquered what we chose
Black wings lead us to the fray
Gave us victory

Legions stood against us
They tried to make us pay
But never faltered or failed
We are cunning - Ravens guide our way

Crossfire lit the northern shore
Never stopped our return
Not force, driven by our fate
Gave us victory

Legions stood against us
They tried to make us pay
But never faltered or failed
We are cunning - Ravens guide our way

Black birds fly
Guide us home
Leave your throne

1. Freja's Choice
Truth in lying
Never can tell
Words that twist and betray
Lore of secrets
Casting her spell
Charms to lure you away

Sorceress
Master of the Sejd
She'll light the way

Her eyes will leave a mark
Her dreams will fill the heart
Her name brings out desire
Riddles in the dark

She'll light the spark

Falcon wings forever soaring
Goddess of the fallen warriors home

Fateful Beauty
Glowing and pure
Turn your gaze down in awe
Golden Mistress
Sowing the need
Sacrifice to receive

Maiden of the shield guides you ashore
The prize of war
Ride on silver wing
Let Valkyries take you home
Her gift is of love
A chance to be reborn

Falcon wings forever soaring
Goddess of the fallen warriors home

Falcon wings forever soaring
Goddess of the fallen warriors home

Freja's choice is always glory
Borne upon the blood-stained wings of war

Blood-stained wings of war

2. Varangian
Fire will guide us on perilous seas
Light in the black the sign that we need
Charge through the storm
Swords in our hands
Leave it to fate or fear takes command

Into the fray
We die and we slay
Our home up above
The hall of the brave

We are warriors – defenders of steel
Fight through the wars, hunger and need
Warriors – defenders of steel
Burn our way to Odin's hall
From all battlefields

Bravery, loyalty bound by the oath
Sworn to protect so far from our home
Guarding a throne, an emperor's reign
Honour is all to the god of the slain

Into the fray
We die and we slay
Our home up above
The hall of the brave

We are warriors – defenders of steel
Fight through the wars, hunger we feed
Warriors – defenders of steel
Burn our way to Odin's hall
From all battlefields

Into the fray
We die and we slay
Our home up above
The hall of the brave

We are warriors – defenders of steel
Fight through all wars, hunger we feed
Warriors – defenders of steel
Burn our way to Odin's hall
From all battlefields

Burn our way to Odin's hall

3. Forged In Iron - Crowned In Steel
All the prophets and deceivers
Try to lead us all astray
We're trusting only in the blade
And the path of destiny
Too proud to kneel
But not to bend
This sword will bring your end
The key to victory is ours
Wielding power in our hand

Bringing
Viking metal – bring you to your knees
Viking metal – a warrior's decree
Viking metal – death is victory
Forged in iron, crowned in steel – Viking metal

We will feed the eagle
We have the means we have the will
Break through your fortress
And your armour
Our edge is primed to kill
We live and die
Our fate is planned
No one fears his end
The key to victory is ours
Wielding power in our hand

Bringing
Viking metal – bring you to your knees
Viking metal – a warrior's decree
Viking metal – death is victory
Forged in iron, crowned in steel – Viking metal

My enemies they must fall down
Mud in the blood-stained ground

Odin grant me gold and glory
Key to victory
Sword of power

Viking metal – bring you to your knees
Viking metal – a warrior's decree
Viking metal – death is victory
Forged in iron, crowned in steel – Viking metal

Odin grant me gold and glory
Key to victory
Sword of power

4. Born For Battle (Black Dog Of Brocéliande)
You were just a child when the flame began to burn
You could not run you could not hide
No one told you there was so much more to learn
Just would not stop before you tried

You hear the calling
Inside you knew

Born for battle
I heard the calling
Hated and scorned
My sword was the warning
I'll defend when you call for

The king has justified the cruelty and pain
A crown and glory
To revel in
Short in stature but a savior to the land
Just let them burn and let me win

I heard the calling
Inside I knew

Born for battle
I heard the calling
Hated and scorned
My sword was the warning
I'll defend to the end

I'm the underdog
Never bark before I bite
Peace a word I never learned
In war my victories mean strife and loss of lives
Never cared if I'd return
Born for battle

My need was created at birth
For glory and blood I was born – burn

Never cared if I'd return

Born for battle
I heard the calling
I'll defend when you call for battle
My sword was the warning
I was born for battle

5. Master Of The Land
Light, the search goes on inside
Deep within my mind
A key that seems to hide
Torn, chained and bound with scorn
Let me be reborn
Into glory ride

Make me master of the land
Master of the land
Master of the land
Answer the call into the fire burn

Free, longing to reveal
A dream so long concealed
Destiny achieved
Burn, wisdom will be mine
Secrets I will learn
Into glory ride

Make me master of the land
Master of the land
Master of the land
Answer the call into the fire

Make me master of the land
Master of the land
Master of the land
Answer the call 

Make me master of the land
Master of the land
Master of the land
Answer the call into the fire burn

6. Last One To Fall
Facing the enemy fear and insanity
Fight with your back to the wall
Horses are falling no quarter is given
Ravens will feast on them all
Gather your strength and ride through the storm
No one will catch you alive
It weather of blades and as twilight sets in
This is the final goodbye

Marching on -
You'll be the last one to fall
Marching on -
You'll be the last one to fall

Bereft of all dignity, pain and depravity
No one will live through this day
The sound of the suffering left as an offering
Souls sent to Valhalla's gates
You stand in the rain as you fought through it all
Tomorrow will never appear
Embracing your fate as the dusk closes in
Blood is the prize of the brave

Marching on -
You'll be the last one to fall
Marching on -
You'll be the last one to fall

Bereft of all dignity
Blood is the prize of the brave
No one will live through this day
Souls sent to Valhalla's gates

Ride through the storm
Song of the sword

You'll be marching on
You'll be the last one to fall
Marching on -
You'll be the last one to fall

7. Frost And Fire
Burning hair
Bringer of despair
Mother of the one who takes the moon
Fierce and tall she will devour all
And her spawn will break the seal of runes

Winds that rage across the fields and lakes
She will ride out from the frozen realm
Screaming through the sky
Wreathed in fury

With frost and fire tame the land
She'll rule, take charge and command

Shadow steed will bring her fatal deeds
And a power never seen before
Serpent reins on a wolf from Hel
She descended on the funeral shore
The gathering didn't have her strength
And she proved that she could best them all
Daughter of the ironwood has come

With frost and fire tame the land
She'll rule, take charge and command

As the ring horn sails
She has won
And her sons will rise

Frost and fire tame the land
She'll rule, take charge and command

With frost and fire tame the land
She'll rule, take charge and command

8. Hugr
[Instrumental]
9. Every Day There's A Battle To Fight
All the walls around you
No one really knows how they were made
Who chose that way?
Conformity or safety
Questioning your sanity is brave
You're not a slave, no
Too many hearts grow stale and cold
Too many die inside and fold

Everyday there's a battle to fight
Never let yourself surrender to the pain
You've got to get up
Be strong and fight them all 
Never let the fear stand in your way

Find the key inside you
Shining through the madness and the hate

It's not too late
A path is always open
Reborn into the thunder and the rain
Free from all shame, yeah
The smallest creatures have it right
The truth is grey not black and white

Everyday there's a battle to fight
Never let yourself surrender to the pain
You've got to get up
Be strong and fight them all 
Never let the fear stand in your way

Stand in your way

10. In For The Kill
Born again as dusk approaches
I've been living far too long as a slave
To the laws of your world
Sound the howl of total freedom
Make the sky and earth my kingdom
There's a gleam and a flash in my eyes
By tomorrow all the sorrow will be gone

I am in for the kill
One with the moon and the wind
In for the kill
One with the moon and the wind

Now their walls give no protection
The grip of fear means no detection
Of the force set upon men and gods
No belief and no religion
Will protect your life from leaving
As the fear reaches out to your soul
It's a grasp that will never let its hold

I am in for the kill
One with the moon and the wind
In for the kill
One with the moon and the wind

You will die

1. Starlight Slaughter
Go on tell me 'bout the reason always turning wrong from right just try, explain your sad existence, why you seem to fear the night
Your answer will show - that dead is your king
I look in your eyes - confusion within
You lose all your pride, and scream as i bite
In a starlight slaughter - vengeance will be mine
Starlight slaughter - rise of wolf kind
Too late, I asked you and i listened and groveling won't save you now
Your tales betray your lack of freedom, struggling to face the light
My Hymn to the moon piercing your mind
Your science will fail
Your eyes turn blind
When red turns to black and the silver moon is full
They will drown in lakes of blood, and regret what they tried to pull
Starlight slaughter - vengeance will be mine
Starlight slaughter - rise of wolf kind

2. Sword Of The Ocean
The first was the last one
The last one to fall
He sounded the warning
And put out the call
Remorseless invaders or traders with gold?
Stand or run
Will flesh pay for metal or riches be shared - stand or run
We bring the fire and the flame
Agony and pain
Sword of the ocean carve me your name
The men on the shoreline
Guardians of old
They prayed for a warning
They ran from the wall
Remorseless invaders or traders with gold?
Stand or run
Will flesh pay for metal or riches be shared - stand or run
We bring the fire and the flame
Agony and pain
Sword of the ocean carve me your name

3. Valhalla Rising
Feel – take my hand
See – wasted lands

‘Cause I lost my fire, and it’s tearing up my soul
Got to fight if I want it
So tired of liars, they’re filling me with shame
Got to fight and get stronger

But the road is long and treachery awaits
To find what’s wrong I have to reach and reveal to see

Valhalla rising – I’m taking flight
Let Valkyries guide me to my destiny
Valhalla rising – I burn tonight
Let ravens fly and give my soul release
The fire is the seed

Take my hand!
No more wasted lands...

I restored my fire now it’s filling up my soul
Even though I was broken
And I fought the liars – the worst of all was me
All the false words I’d spoken

As I travelled on I realised my fate
It made me strong and now I finally see what's been revealed

Valhalla rising – I’m taking flight
Let Valkyries guide me to my destiny
Valhalla rising – I burn tonight
Let ravens fly and give my soul release
The fire was the seed

Take my hand!
No more wasted lands...

And now I finally see what's been revealed

Valhalla rising – I’m taking flight
Let Valkyries guide me to my destiny
Valhalla rising – I burn tonight
Let ravens fly and give my soul release
The fire was the seed

Take my hand!

4. Storm King
Time to reap all the violence they have sewn
Kept you down with their torture
Crushed your bones
From slavery your rebellion screams of fire
Too late 'cause you'll never be their pawn
You've grown too strong
You're the Storm King
Ride the lightning
Rule the thunder shake the ground
Two thousand years spent imprisoned
You were chained
Born a stallion but broken down - hurt and malmed
A fury and rage ignited in the tears
they'll pay and you'll never be their pawn
You've grown too strong
You're the Storm King
Ride the lightning
Rule the thunder, shake the ground

5. Silver Moon
Unleashed by my hate -
Flesh torn away from the bone
A fire that burns - a fever that never subsides
Surrender to fate - free from the shackles that bind
By the silvery sheen -
The moon will decide who will die
I've found the strength to live alone
I've left my kin I've left my home
By silver light I'll carve my own
To last and live my power's grown

Embers - burning runes
Sever the ties - destiny calls
Black sky - silver moon
I'm gonna rise - you're gonna fall

Summoning fire - men of the cross stand aside
A heathen belief - northern revenge is at hand
No masters or kings -
The cry for my freedom resounds
The passion is free -
The blood-covered snow is the sign

Embers - burning runes
Sever the ties - destiny calls
Black sky - silver moon
I'm gonna rise - you're gonna fall

6. The Hunt
He's alive -- the stories were right
And now there's a lesson to learn

Took his land and curse him as damned
But now he will make them all burn

Tonight the grey one's arrived
To reveal all the lies, the shadow's arrived
And he won't shed a tear for our emptiness and fear

Blood will spill
I follow the hunt
Chase and kill
Follow the hunt

Running free, the beast inside of me
Will join in his howl to the moon

Every sense come alive
And the passion ignites

'cause his beckoning call brings us doom

Tonight the grey one's arrived
To reveal all the lies, the shadow's arrived
And he won't shed a tear for our emptiness and fear

Blood will spill
I follow the hunt
Chase and kill
Follow the hunt

Blood will stain the land
As the hunt will take command

Tonight the grey one's arrived
To reveal all the lies,

Blood will spill
I follow the hunt
Chase and kill
Follow the hunt

Blood will spill
We follow the hunt
Chase and kill
We follow the hunt

7. Son Of The Last Breath: Part I -- Nattfödd, Part II -- Vedergällning
[Part I: Nattfödd]

One night in November my soul found a heart
In glistening frost by the light of the stars
One night in November my soul found its home
In the glow of the moon I was born
All my grief washed away
It's the end of my plight
No mourning was left
Only feral delight
All my grief washed away
By the blood that was shed
In the glow of the moon I was born

[Part II: Vedergällning]

Hide all trace
Count the days
Nine to reach my fate
Nine days t obring the change
Destiny fulfilled
Eight brings me sight
Seven gives me light
Six days and wounds are healed
Strength has returned
Bless the mighty Thor
Blood will stain your shores
Swear I will return
Prepare yourself for war
Praise the mighty Thor
Blood will stain your shores
Swear I will return
Prepare yourself for war
I will hide all trace
Count the days
Nine to reach my fate
Swear to return
Nine days to bring the change
Destiny fulfilled
Five proves me right
Four ends the fight
Three, two and one completes the change
Then I will rise

8. Iron Hand
You speak of hell and how you fell
Looking out for something new
You broke the law, you've seen it all
Really nothing more to tell
But you miss a vital piece - the key to everlasting power
Yes you lack the inner strength - a way to push them all aside
Steel will guide you right
Got to keep it locked inside you at all times - never let them see the way to climb
Rulel them all - feel the grip of an iron hand - take command
Rule them - to make it last and to remain, never let confusion reign
You speak of pain and always claim
You never really had a chance
But there's a call to break them all
Listen now or try in vain
There's a way to build the strength - a path to everlasting power
Summon up the right defense - and you'll break their will to fight
Steel will guide you right
Got to keep it locked inside you at all times, never let them see the way to climb
Rule them all - feel the grip of an iron hand - take command
Rule them - to make it last and to remain, never let confusion reign
Rule them all
Rule with an iron hand or you will fall

9. Draksådd
There's a lock inside the lonely cell, but we fail to find the key
There's a way to solve the riddles quick, but we always choose to leace
If the urge to hurt the weaker one gets stronger than before
Maybe wisdom leaves us all alone and we'll never break the door
If we refuse to take heed or learn - why would I stay or be concerned?
If the madness will spread like fire - why would I wish I could return?
There's a wall that separates us and divides
Hide the greed - put on a pleasant smile
Break the fall yet you're ashamed to be alive
Build a solid web of lies, web of lies
So we're pushing on for selfishness, while me march on forever blind
We develop as we sell our souls, and the connection is lost in time
If we refuse to take heed or learn - why would I stay or be concerned?
If the madness would spread like fire - why would I wish I could return?
There's a wall that separates us and divides
Hide the greed - put on a pleassant smile
Break the fall yet you're ashamed to be alive
Build a solid we b of lies, web of lies
No use in waiting for it - your kind will never understand
What separates us is a plan
There's a wall that separates us and divides
Hide the greed - put on a pleasant smile
Break the fall yet you're ashamed to be alive
Spin a solid web of lies, web of lies

GRAND MAGUS LYRICS


1. Ascension
[INSTRUMENTAL]

2. Heaven
[music: youngblood, lyrics: Warner]

Look towards the sea,
Tell me what do you see?
Will you know what it is when you've found it?

You searched high above and you searched far below
But it still seems so far and you know it

Time - It dwindles away
There's a clock on the wall
And it seems that is calling your name
But you can't run away
He'll be right there behind you
Reminding you it's not a game

I will conquer the beast and I'll swim the seven seas
And my heart will still beat and I'll never give up
I will walk desert plains and endure gruelling pain
And my heart will still beat and I'll never give up

Heaven is a heartbeat away for your dreams of
Tomorrow could end today
Heaven is a heartbeat away for your dreams of
Tomorrow could end today.

3. Rise Again
[music: youngblood, lyrics: Warner]

Heat from the ground feeds the fire
My desire to live with this rage
With thoughts of you filling my nights
And my days...

Sounds of the speaking of tongues
Visions of circles undone
Keeps this heart of mine beating
For the time of our meeting will come

Now, I turn to the gods
Whichever will listen
From below or above

Hear my cry,
Feel my pain
If I should fall,
I'll start over again

Hear my cry,
Feel my pain
If I should die,
I will rise again

I scream to the sky full of anger
My body increasingly weaker

[SOLO]

I won't die for you
I won't die for you
Heaven is a heartbeat away

Hear my cry,
Feel my pain
If I should fall,
I'll start over again

Hear my cry,
Feel my pain
If I should Die,
I will rise again.

4. One Day I'll Win
[music: youngblood, lyrics: Warner]

ONE DAY I'LL WIN
ONE DAY I'LL WIN
ONE DAY YOU WILL SEE
ONE DAY I'LL WIN
ONE DAY I'LL WIN
FOR I WISH IT TO BE
AND THEN YOU WILL SEE
ONE DAY I'LL WIN
LOOK IN MY EYES
YOU'LL SEE A DIFFERENT PART OF ME
HEAR MY WORDS SPEAK
YOU'LL HEAR A DIFFERENT PART OF ME
YES I KNOW I'M A SIMPLE MAN
YES I KNOW IT'S A COMPLEX LAND
IF I TELL MYSELF I CAN IF I DREAM
THEREFORE I AM
OH LORD, PLEASE HEAR ME OH LORD,
PLEASE HEAR MY SONG
IT'S ALL I OWN, IT'S ALL I OWN
LOOK IN MY EYES
YOU'LL SEE A DIFFERENT PART OF ME
HEAR MY WORDS SPEAK
YOU'LL HEAR A DIFFERENT PART OF ME

5. We Are Not Separate
[music: youngblood, lyrics: Warner]

LAUNCH THE SILVER SPEAR
THE WORLD WILL CRY A TEAR
IN THE HEAVENS WILL APPEAR ANOTHER ANGEL
HEAR THE ELDERS CRY
WAITING FOR THEIR TIME
AS THEY LOOK TOWARDS THE HEAVENS
WHY WON'T THEY ANSWER?
WE ARE PLAYING WITH NATURE
SPLITTING THE ATOM
CONFUSING RELIGIONS
KILLING THE MASSES
WE ARE NOT SEPARATE FROM WHAT WE DESTROY
TIME HAS COME FOR US TO MAKE THE ONLY CHOICE
WE ARE NOT SEPARATE FROM WHAT WE DESTROY
TIME HAS COME FOR US TO MAKE THE ONLY CHOICE
WE RAPE FOR OUR POWER
NOT CARING FOR LIFE
WE TARNISH OUR WATERS
'TIL THEY ARE AS BLACK AS NIGHT
WE VISUALIZE THE FUTURE
WITH THE EYES OF THE BLIND
WE HEAR NATURE CALLING
BUT WE STILL DENY
WE ARE NOT SEPARATE FROM WHAT WE DESTROY
TIME HAS COME FOR US TO MAKE THE ONLY CHOICE

6. Birth Of A Hero
[music: youngblood, lyrics: Warner]

HE WAS A YOUNG BOY
ABOUT TO BE A MAN
SHE LOVED HIM SO
OH PLEASE DON'T GO
DOWN ON HIS KNEES
THE BLADE PASSED WITH EASE
SHOULDER TO SHOULDER
AS IT PIERCES HER HEART
OUT IN THE FIELDS
THE BOY BECOMES A MAN
TASTE OF BLOOD IN HIS THROAT
FEEL OF DEATH ON HIS HANDS
HE SHALL FALL ON THIS DARK, MISTY NIGHT
AS HE FALLS HE HEARS HIS LOVED ONE CRY
BIRTH OF A HERO
DEATH OF A MAN
SHE'LL NEVER UNDERSTAND
WHY HE LEFT HER HAND
HE WAS A YOUNG BOY
SHE LOVED HIM SO
SHE WATCHED THE SUN SET
AND LONGED FOR HIS JOURNEY HOME
FLAGS FLY LOW
THE BLADE CUT DEEP
NOW SHE MUST BEAR THE WOUNDS
THAT MEMORIES BLEED

7. Creation
[INSTRUMENTAL]

8. Sin
[music: youngblood lyrics: Warner]

BLACK IS THE NIGHT THAT CALLS ME
SINNER FROM A SIN
THE WATERS THAT ONCE DID BLESS ME
NOW BURN MY SKIN FEARING THE FIELDS OF FIRE
AND THE WAR THAT'S WITHIN
I'LL DRAW MY SWORD FOR THE LAST TIME
IT'S HERE THIS WILL END
BLACK IS THE NIGHT THAT CALLS ME
A VOICE FROM WITHIN
PLAYING WITH MY EMOTIONS
WHEN WILL IT END?
PROMISING PURE DESIRE
OF THE PLEASURES OF SIN
I'LL DRAW MY SWORD FOR THE LAST TIME
IT'S HERE THIS WILL END
YOU MAY TRY TO FIND ME
I'LL HIDE DEEP IN YOUR HEAD
YOU MAY TRY TO FIGHT ME
I'M A SEED FROM DEEP WITHIN
YOU MAY NOT RECALL INVITING ME
BUT I WAS THERE THE FIRST TIME YOU SINNED
YOU MAY NOT RECALL INVITING ME
BUT I WILL BE HERE UNTIL THE END
(AND HERE IT WILL END)

9. Song Of Roland
[music: youngblood, lyrics: Warner]

AS CRUSADERS RAVAGE THE EARTH
AT NIGHT THEIR SWORDS AND SHIELDS HANG TO THEIR SIDE
FOR THE BATTLE THEY HAD FORSAKEN
FOR THE GLORY THEY HAD FORTAKEN
THE KING RIDES AHEAD OF THE GROUP
HOMEWARD BOUND HE MARCHES HIS TROOPS
FOR FAIR LAND FRANCE LIES IN THE BALANCE
FOR FOE MAN FRANCE HOME OF THE GALLANT
SONG OF ROLAND
NEVER KNIGHT BE SO WORTHY
SONG OF ROLAND
NEVER KNIGHT BE SO WORTHY
THE KING HOLDS GRIEF IN HIS EYES
FOR HIS NEPHEW HE'S LEFT BEHIND
TO ENSURE THE BACKGROUND IS STABLE
TO ENSURE THEM AGAINST ATTACK
THE KING KNEELS TO HIS NEPHEW,
BRAVE KNIGHT PRINCE ROLAND
HE HOLDS TEARS IN HIS EYES
AND PAIN IN HIS HEART
'FOR OUR GOD'S WE TEAR OUR WORLD'S APART
AND WITH THIS DEATH I LEAVE YOU
ONE LAST THOUGHT
NEVER KNIGHT BE SO WORTHY
TILL FRANCE BE NO MORE'
AS LANCES DRAW UPON THE ENEMY
A SEA OF WAVING BANNERS SURROUND,
THE MOORS FALL FROM THE HILLSIDE
LIKE THE RAIN IN THE DARK FOREST
AS THE BATTLE ROLLS ON
THE MEN FALL TO GROUND
THEIR EARS ACHE FOR THE SHRILL OF THE HORN,
BUT ROLAND PERSISTS ON HOLDING HIS GROUND,
'LET US STRIKE A MIGHTY BLOW
FOR OUR LORD AND OUR GOD!'
SONG OF ROLAND
NEVER KNIGHT BE SO WORTHY
SONG OF ROLAND
NEVER KNIGHT BE SO WORTHY

10. Crossing Two Rivers
[music: youngblood, lyrics: Warner]

CROSSING TWO RIVERS
AND FIELDS IN THE DARK
HE IS IN LOVE ENSLAVED BY THE HEART
SHE WAITS BY THE WINDOW FOR
THE FIRST SIGHT OF HER LOVE
SHE HOPES AND PRAYS
THAT NOTHING WILL KEEP THEIR LOVE APART
TWO SEPARATE KINGDOMS
TWO SEPARATE LIVES THROWN APART
BY THE HATE AND LIES
SHE WAITS BY THE WINDOW
FOR THE LOVE THAT LEFT HER ARMS
SHE HOPES AND PRAYS
THAT ONE DAY THEIR HEARTS WILL BEAT AS ONE
EVEN THOUGH THEIR WORLD'S AT WAR
LOVE GROWS STRONGER THAN BEFORE
THE MOATS BETWEEN THEIR LOVE GROW SHALLOW
CROSSING TWO RIVERS
AND FIELDS IN THE DARK
HE IS IN LOVE ENSLAVED BY THE HEART
SHE WAITS BY THE WINDOW
FOR THE LOVE THAT LEFT HER ARMS
SHE HOPES AND PRAYS
THAT ONE DAY THEIR HEARTS WILL BEAT AS ONE
EVEN THOUGH THEIR WORLD'S AT WAR
LOVE GROWS STRONGER THAN BEFORE
THE MOATS BETWEEN THEIR LOVE GROW SHALLOW

11. Troubled Mind
[music: youngblood, pavlicko, lyrics: Warner]

CLOSING MY EYES AGAIN
TO FORGET ABOUT THE DAY
I'VE SEEN IT ALL BEFORE
AND I'LL SEE IT ALL AGAIN
BUT I'LL NEVER KNOW JUST WHY
OH LORD, HELP ME TO SEE A WAY
TO LIVE THIS DREAM
FOR MY TIME IS RUNNING SHORT
AND MY PATIENCE WEARING THIN
BY MORNING I'LL NEVER KNOW
WHAT SHAPE I'LL BE IN
A BROKEN RAINBOW FALLS FROM THE SKY
THE TEARS OF SORROW FILL A YOUNG MAN'S EYES
THERE'S A DARK CRY FROM DEEP INSIDE
FROM A SPLINTERING HEART
THIS RIVER I RIDE ON ALWAYS
SEEMS TO FLOW MY WAY
AND THE STARS I LOOK TO GUIDE ME
SHINE BRIGHTER THAN THE DAY
THE SILENCE OF THE NIGHT
CALMS A TROUBLED MIND
THE WORRIES OF THE DAY
JUST SEEM TO FADE AWAY
(FADE AWAY)
A BROKEN RAINBOW FALLS FROM THE SKY
THE TEARS OF SORROW FILL A YOUNG MAN'S EYES
THERE'S A DARK CRY
FROM DEEP INSIDE FROM A SPLINTERING HEART

1. Eternity
As I sit upon these rocks above
I feel the waves crash upon the shore
As the sea sprays on my glowing face
I wish I could embrace the sea 
for evermore
As I lay my head to sleep at night
I dream the sea and me we flow as one
But I'm a prisoner of the sands and
no one understands these childish dreams

An old man approaches me
His feeble mind confusing to thee
He speaks in riddles and rhymes
Tales of an old witch that cast him
from the sea
But wait my eyes full of splendor
or could this be some crazy old tale 
I look to his eyes for the answer

I will my soul to the sea
for Eternity
I will my soul to the sea
for Eternity

And so the journey begins
The pain and suffering
Are your dreams worth this torment?
You can deal Another hand
But the light in the distance
promises this the journeys end
Great gods of olympus
Great god Poseidon
Accept this mortal never let 
Him return, For He's willed
His soul to the sea
For Eternity

I will my soul to the sea
for Eternity
I will my soul to the sea
for Eternity

2. Black Tower
O Black Tower what is your power?
What makes men run and hide
I've foreseen the evil in the
Dead of the night
As the demons they dance in my mind

Telling tales of horror
And the splendor of their torture
Burning flames reach for the sky
The gates of Hell are open wide

O Black Tower
Black Tower

O Black Tower
Why do you devour?
The souls they sleep in the night
Casting evil shadows signs of no tomorrows
Why must I fear for my life?

Telling tales of horror
And the splendor of their torture
Burning flames reach for the sky
The gates of Hell are open wide
Why must the demons dance in my mind?

O Black Tower
Black Tower

Now I know it's the truth
All the evil men do
They shall pay their dues
Nightmares tell the truth

O Black Tower
Black Tower

Why must the demons dance in my mind?

3. Call Of The Sea
Endless alone lost at sea
It's a never ending chore to
Keep my head above these waters
I've never feared before

The sun has taken its toll
The salt runs in my veins
I've never feared before these
Waters I've grown to hate
Will I live to see tomorrow?
Or will I die in this watery depth?
The sea is calling me
My will to live is stronger than
These tides could ever be
The sea is calling me
Why won't I let these waters
Claim me victory?

I long for the place where the 
Winds and the tide tear at the shore
But in the twilights of my dreams
The fire rages on

Endless alone lost at sea
It's a never ending chore to
Keep my head above these waters
I've never feared before

I long for the place where the 
Winds and the tide tear at the shore
But in the twilights of my dreams
The fire rages on

The sea is calling me
My will to live is stronger than
These tides could ever be
The sea is calling
Why won't I let these waters
Claim me victory?

4. Proud Nomad
Now I tell you an ancient tale
Of an ancient man
From not such a distant land
Chivalry rode forth on his mighty horse 
The crest of the church 
Engraved upon his chest 

Winding down this dizzy path 
Towards the dragon's lair
The howl of the wind screams beware 
Your pulse starts to quicken
Your blood runs with fear
You feel the heat now rising
It tells the dragon's near

Proud nomad of the past
Beware of yourself for
Your life won't last
Proud Nomad of the past
Pride has killed a thousand 
Men before you 
Proud Nomad of the past
Beware of yourself for
Your life won't last

Proud Nomad of the past
So let not this foolishness 
Hold you in it's grasp
Stop, beware, run for your life
Fear for your life
While there's still time to choose
Halt don't go near
Don't you realize you have only one life 
So don't be a fool

But time and time again
I see it in their eyes
It's the weakness of mortal men
They live by this creed
Though it will find them dead

Proud Nomad of the past
Beware of yourself for
Your life won't last

5. Red Sands
SHRILL OF THE HORN SCREAMS MY NAME
POUNDING THE GROUND
THE GAMES BEGIN
THE CROWD THEY ROAR
THE BLOOD IT BOILS INSIDE ME
I FEAR NOT YOU YOU FEAR NOT ME
THE SWORDS ARE DRAWN
AND SHIMMERING
THE TIME HAS COME AGAIN 
TO HONOR OUR KING

THE GODS HAVE BLESSED
THIS WICKED GAME
FIGHT WE MUST AND SHOW NO SHAME 
FOR THE TIME HAS COME AGAIN 
TO FEED OUR BLOOD THIRSTY KING

I LOOK INTO YOUR EYES
REFLECTIONS OF THE SKY
A WHISPER ON THE WIND 
AS YOUR SOUL SAYS GOODBYE

REDS SANDS UNDERNEATH MY FEET
STAINED BY THE BLOOD
I DRAW FROM THEE
RED SANDS AS FAR AS I CAN SEE
TAINTED THESE LANDS
STAINED BY HISTORY

WHAT ONCE WAS A WHISPER
NOW IS AN ECHO IN MY HEAD
THE LOOK ON THEIR FACES
AS I STAND IN THIS SEA OF RED
I FEEL THE EVIL RISING
HEAR THE MESMERIZING 
VOICE FROM HELL
FEEL THE EVIL RISING
HEAR THE MESMERIZING
VOICE FROM HELL

6. One Of The Hunted
I feel the distant stare
Of a watching eye
Watching eyes of THE woodsman
Quivers of death await me here
I'm blind to their illusion - confusion

Fletching of fowl Slips
Through the wind
Releasing their death with
Their fingers
My fate lies on a tensel line
I must escape but there's
Nowhere to hide

The now exchanging roles
In this theater of ill HUMOR
The understudy steals
The stage with an encore performance

One of the hunted - 
The tables have turned
One of the hunted -
There's nowhere to run
One of the hun ted -
The tables have turned
One of the hunted - 
There's nowhere to run

In the temples of nature 
I hear the laughter
Just another victim on 
This lonely trail
They show no emotion for
This loss of life
It reminds me of myself not long ago
And the cries for life that 
I'd seem to ignore
The cries for life are now
My very own

One of the hunted
The tables have turned
One of the hunted
There's nowhere to run
One of the hunted
The tables have turned
One of the hunted
There's nowhere to run

7. Fire Within
Take a look into the crystal
Take a look at what the
Future may bring
All around you is darkness 
As your shattered soul screams
As I stand before the crystal
See my life pass before me 
Stand up straight look into my
Eyes tell me what do you see?

Is there no gold at the end 
Of this rainbow?
Is there no hope at the end
Of the road?
Will there be strength for 
The dreams that I've lived for 
Or will I just let go?

Many years have passed me by
Many trials of life i've survived
stills the head wind blows my way
It's getting harder everyday

Is there no gold at the end
Of this rainbow?
Is there no hope at the end
Of the road?
Will there be strength for 
The dreams that I've lived for 
Or will I just let go?

The fire within is smoldering
The waters of life are raging In
Once there was passion
Desire to win

8. Warbird
Taking time out to create 
His own war
It an aerial assault
It's the war of the bird
Strapped to his forearm
Awaiting flight,
He's blind as the night
Set his mask free
Piercing eyes point towards the sea

A waiting white gull 
So swift in flight
Flowing like the sea
Shadowed by his wing spread
As the bird takes to flight
He is bound in ecstacy

As the claws sink in deep
He hears the bird start to scream
As his life is taken from him
Another trophy retrieved

Warbird Champion your King
Warriors on wings
Warbird Champion your King
Warriors on wings

Sheltered eyes hide the deep blue sky
Shackles hold the arching wings
Until tomorrow imprisoned
For tomorrow he will be free

Taking time out to create
His own war
It an aerial assault
It's the war of the bird
Strapped to his forearm
Awaiting flight
He's blind as the night
Set his mask free
Piercing eyes point 
Towards the sea

9. What About Me
It was just another night
She held me in
Her arms so tight
We were dreaming with the
Stars in our eyes
But I never realized

Like The wild in a cage
Waiting to be free
A bird on the ground
With a broken wing
You wanted to fly
You had to be free
But what about me?

It was just another day
You had so much to say
Our love was still strong
But you had to be free

Like the wild in a cage
Waiting to be free
A bird on the ground
With a broken wing
You wanted to fly
You had to be free
But what about me?

Now the sands of time 
Have buried the heartbreak
You walked in with the wind
Uncovered the memories
You're holding your arms out to me
Temptation is all I see
I have to be strong
You had to be free
Cause it's all about me

Like The wild in a cage
Waiting to be free
A bird on the ground
With a broken wing
You wanted to fly
You had to be free
But what about me?

10. Etude Jongleur
[INSTRUMENTAL]

11. The Gleeman
My entrance purely pleasure
For your riches I ask you not
For I am the gleeman
Who loves to sing
And strike upon my golden harp

So I bow before you o mighty king
In the hopes you hear my song
These feet have traveled far and wide
In a life lived FOR THE song

I claim no land my home
For I know not where I'm from
Traveled mountain peaks 
And valleys low
In a life for the son of a bard

Raise your harp my friend
For the song that burns
In your heart
Sing of the heroes
And the days that time forgot
Sing of the days of the Earls and 
The Kings and the Knights 
That conquered great feats
For these are the things 
That we all dream
But only your eyes have seen 

A life for a lyric
I've traveled these war lands deep
Raging the knights in shining armor
Surely death awaits the weak
I've sailed the viking vessels
Plunging the northern seas
Crossing the blue horizon
No land for the eye to see
For the eye to see
Raise your harp my friend
For the song that burns 
In your heart
Sing of the heroes
And the days that time forgot
Sing of the days of the Earls 
And the Kings and the Knights
That conquered great feats
For these are the things

KAMELOT LYRICS


1. New Allegiance
[INSTRUMENTAL]

2. The Fourth Legacy
settle for the journey
sail across the seven seas
carried by the spirit of the brave
join the New Allegiance now
and pledge your sacred heart
a history that no one can forsake

flying like an eagle from oblivion
guided by the rising morning star
[Live version:] rising in the mirror of the sky

you will find the New Allegiance
like a beacon in the night
if you're searching for salvation
reach inside
there's a new world approaching
a fire to be seen
in following The Fourth Legacy

once you find the passage
to another promised land
don't forget the ones you left behind

flying like an eagle from oblivion
rising in the mirror of the sky
[Live version:] guided by the rising morning star

you will find the New Allegiance
like a beacon in the night
if you're searching for salvation
reach inside
there's a new world approaching
a fire to be seen
in following The Fourth Legacy

there's glory in the distance
for the one's that pay the price
ignorance creates a subtle mind

keep the fighting spirit
never close your eyes
don't forget the ones you left behind

flying like an eagle from oblivion
rising in the mirror of the sky

you will find the New Allegiance
like a beacon in the night
if you're searching for salvation
reach inside
there's a new world approaching
a fire to be seen
in following The Fourth Legacy

3. Silent Goddess
I rest my eyes
on the open field
a silver line
to heavens gate
my mind is blank
it's a state I know
a sacred place
where all I see is hate

I raise my head
to retain my wrath
the savage force
that lives inside of me
foe to foe
one will die and one will be

and I pray she holds my soul
can you hear me calling?

silent goddess won't you
conduct my fear away
silent goddess won't you be
closer when I hate

the battle cries
and the sound of steel
another quest
for holy land
some true belief
in each open wound
in Luna's light the lonely victor stands
and I pray she holds my soul
can you hear me calling?

silent goddess won't you
conduct my fear away
silent goddess won't you be
closer when I hate
silent goddess will you
forever be the same
silent goddess can you
feel this heart pulsate

you know that I die for belief
I swear by the sword in my hand
the sum of the pain and the grief
is nothing compared to the
wealth I obtain
and the spirit of god can expand

4. Desert Reign

5. Nights Of Arabia
came across
the waters
a kingdom in the sands
unfaithful to the sultan
a killing was at hand
challenged to survival
a legacy of fear
eternal mystic legends
one for every tear

nights of Arabia
the queen has lost her right to life
nights of Arabia
her destiny in story lines
nights of Arabia
a thousand tales and one for life
these are nights of Arabia

whispers in the moonlight
a gathering of vales
circled round the fire
to hear this evenings tale
standing on the threshold
the crest of darkened nights
seduction of the hunter
the slave regains her might

"lost inside a shadow
erase the sins I've made
heavenly reward me
with mercy on my fate"

nights of Arabia
the queen has lost her right to life
nights of Arabia
her destiny in story lines
nights of Arabia
a thousand tales and one for life
these are nights of Arabia
Scheherazade will never die

the sultan relents his feeble heart
his love for the queen is greater than he'll ever know
"it's easy to let you feed my nights
someone to touch, someone to hold,
someone to feel, someone to love"

"here I am to die alone
voices from heaven above
hear my call awaken my soul
forgive me for what I have done"

challenged to survival
a legacy of fear
eternal mystic legends
one for every tear

6. The Shadow Of Uther
due to the legend
a new king will come
rise in the morning horizon
brave and believing
for wars to be won
born with the heart of a lion
he will fight for a country unite
till the last drop of blood confines the oath
till all will respect him wherever he roams

deep in the woods
he can hear she's alive
lost in the dark
of a dragons lament
searching the highlands
in trying to find
trace of Morgana
the Princess of Hate

he will be holding
the sword in the stone
knights of the kingdom will join him
bring back the honor
of Pendragons name
from where the cauldron is boiling

but the shadow of Uther restrains
all the efforts to reunite the realm
a witch of his own blood from heaven expelled

deep in the woods
there are prints in the sand
leading towards
where the angels repent
king of the ocean
king of the land
nothing can save him
from Merlin's consent

coming of storms
battles of war
knights of thunder are fearless
thus goes the legend
the tale I was told
now we await his appearance
but the shadow of Uther remains
there is no way the king can break the oath
the shadow will follow wherever he roams

7. A Sailorman's Hymn
can you hear the sirens resound?
from the coastline of Ireland tonight
it's the song of a promising heart
of the souls that the ocean unite

and she stands by the window alone
staring into the rain
she is trying to guide his way home
from the waters that keep them apart

so she lights up a candle for hope to be found
captive and blind by the darkness around
firm as a mountain, she never will mourn
timeless awaiting the break of dawn

can you hear the sailorman's hymn?
as it comes with the rise of the tide
it is sung where the rainbow begins
as a comfort for tears she has cried

she remains by the window alone
staring into the rain
she is trying to guide his way home
keeps on praying for god to protect him

she lights up a candle for hope to be found
captive and blind by the darkness around
each wave a promise, a new hope reborn
sunrise consoles at the break of dawn

8. Alexandria
far across the sea
a piece of history
in Egypt's land
I'll build a city
beautiful and strong
beyond belief
a new metropolis
to redefine my destiny

rise and shine Alexandria
under protection of my name
pure, divine, and imperial

a place to watch the stars
the center of the earth
I see it all... my worlds converging
and to guide a king's armada through the night
I raise the seventh wonder to delight Poseidon

rise and shine Alexandria
under protection of my name
pure, divine, and imperial

make me the city of a living angel
casting shades all over Babylon
hailing me, a holy son of god
as a monument of time
and the goals that I achieved
make a sculpture of my mind

9. The Inquisitor
I am a cleric serving god the king and queen
I claim confession
and true belief by any means
purification heal heretics
burn the demons out

and god's behind me
watch my each and every move
you know I'll find you
in the shadow of a shattered moon
come all you witches
my procedures are approved

won't you let me ease your sorrow
let me guide you through the night
all my methods clean and thorough
don't you fear the light

I reassemble
broken souls and wasted lives
I raise my head and see
my father through the blood red skies
and in my dreams I know he holds my sanctuary

so all you witches bow to the auto-de-fe
just close your eyes and listen to my holy say
you disbelievers
little do you know

won't you let me ease your sorrow
purify your poisoned veins
there is yet a new tomorrow
I will ease your pain

ease your pain
the fire's burning wild
ease your pain
the inquisition
has drained the demons
like I said it would

10. Glory
sworn by the crown
I lead a crusade
fight for belief to be one

out in the field
fearless and cold
building the road to my Calvary

strong is my steel
dark is my mind
carmine the ground that I tread

faith in my god
keeps me alive
but when does my faith turn to doubt

silently watching the rain
carving the earth on my grave
lord you know that I prayed
one for the glory
and one for the souls that I've slain

how will I know
how could I tell
where would I find some serenity

sowing the seed
unwounded I bleed
lord won't you show me the way

Christ is the cross that I bear
god is the will of my war
faint are the voices I hear
whispers of glory...

Christ is the cry of despair
cursing the day I was born
this is the faith that we share
left with the glory
and suffering of souls that we've torn

11. Until Kingdom Come
in the black of the night she appears
I can see that she's trying
to relocate the source of my fears
I've been searching her high and low

in this dream she will show me the door
to a new revelation
and I know that I've seen her before
that she'll bring me salvation

I remember when she was still alive
always there by my side
every day is a fight to survive
every minute a shattered memory

like the sun shining down on me
like the breeze on the ocean
you're the path of my destiny
I know you will follow me until Kingdom Come

when I watch from the tower at night
into fading horizons
I can see her shade in the twilight
dressed in silver she's dancing

I recall as if it was today
always there by my side
you are reason, and relief to my pain
and one day we will reunite

like the sun shining down on me
like the breeze on the ocean
you're the path of my destiny
I know you will follow me until Kingdom Come
like the sun shining down on me
like the breeze on the ocean
you're the path of my destiny
I'll follow my heart until Kingdom Come

12. Lunar Sanctum
little do I know
little do I care
little would it help
if knew and was aware
aim beyond the stars
catch a glimpse of gold
a planetary chart
where the stories are untold

there's a piece of truth for everyone
give me something to die for
like a sacrifice for days bygone
in my solitude

there's a place where I want to hide
with a view to a shallow moon
there's a star in my cosmic mind
that reminds me of you

a gathering of wolfs
under Luna's light
fear of the unknown
make us worshippers at night

there's a compromise for everyone
but I need something to die for
like a sacrifice for days bygone
in my solitude

there's a place where I want to hide
with a view to a shallow moon
there's a star in my cosmic mind
that reminds me of you

tokens of the afterlife
feeding on the blood of Christ
chasing for an alibi
searching for the holyland
following the masterplan
does it matter in end?

souls unwoken
hearts unbroken
lunar rites
seize tonight

13. Can You Remember
[Bonus track]

"Hey! Woo! Thank you! Okay, we're gonna slow it down for a bit now.
This is a song about a girl that might have forgotten me by now.
But I hope we will meet again some time in the future."

A flame within my heart has died
This a song, it's song with no reprise
Today I just don't know why
What we had and what we shared, so divine

Sunrise in Osaka, but I'm cold tonight
The northern lights are shining, and my dreams take flight

Can you remember? Tell me how far I have to go
Can you remember lust in the eastern skies?
Can you remember when you told me sayonara?
Can you remember me? 'Cause I will never say goodbye

A flame within my heart has died
Too far away, it's too far for me to say
I wish I could turn back time
Is there anyone to blame? Show me the way

Sunrise in Osaka, but I'm cold tonight
The northern lights are shining, and my dreams take flight
Memories are forever, and I see your face
Crying in the distance, 'til we fall from grace

Can you remember? Tell me how far I have to go?
Can you remember lust in the eastern skies?
Can you remember when you told me sayonara?
Can you remember me? 'Cause I will never say goodbye

Can you remember? Tell me how far I have to go
Can you remember lust in the eastern skies?
Can you remember when you told me sayonara?
Can you remember me? 'Cause I will never say goodbye

"Thank you."


Track comments to "The Fourth Legacy"

"New Allegiance"
Intro music to the CD, we wanted to do something different this time for
our intro. The past had the typical epic intro that a lot of bands seem to
do these days. We liked the feel of this melody and it's a perfect
beginning to a diverse and powerful record.

"The Fourth Legacy"
We wanted to have a song that is an anthem to the past, present and future
of Kamelot. The words all refer to just that. We also wanted to torture
the drummer with a speedy, uptempo song like this one delivers.
Audentis Fortuna iuvat. (Fortune assists the bold)

"Silent Goddess"
This record has a few references to God and war. The irony of wars in the
name of God. The story of this song starts on the battlefield and the
warrior in the heat of battle. He is praying to Mother Mary for
forgiveness. The question, is it right to kill in the name of religion?
"Faith, like a jackal, feeds among the tombs, and even
from these dead doubts she gathers her most vital hope."

"Desert Reign"
Intro song to Arabia. Sascha and I wanted to make this as authentic as
possible. We hired an Arabian musician for percussion and other strange
instruments I've never seen or heard before. The result is a trance like
song that sets the mood perfect for what's to come.

"Nights of Arabia"
This is based on the tales "Arabian Nights" written 100's of years ago.
Out of this tale spawned Sindbad, Ali Baba and many more. Queen Scheherazade
is kept captive and sentenced to die for adultery. The song was my
favorite to record and also the lush strings we added make it very Epic.
"The art of being a slave is to rule one's master".

"The Shadow Of Uther"
We based this song on Uther Pendragon. Father to Arthur of the fabled
Camelot tales. Based in Ireland, the song captures the melodies that
emanate from that region.
"Desire, mans ultimate friend or foe"

"A Sailorman's Hymn"
The album's ballad. This song started out while Khan was visiting me in
America. We were in the middle of writing Alexandria and the electricity
went out in my house. So we lit some candles I started plucking the
acoustic guitar with the main melody of the song. "Bright are the Candles
that shineth tonight" was the original chorus. That inspired the
connection between a Sailorman's loved one back home waiting for his
return from the sea. Backup vocals by Icelander Rannveig Sif
Sigurdardottir add the finishing touches to my favorite Kamelot
ballad to date.
"Hope springs eternal life"

"Alexandria"
Based on Alexander the Great. His conquest and triumphs that led to his
eventual immortality in history.
"The future belongs to those who believe in the beauty of their dreams."

"The Inquisitor"
This is another song that touches on the subject of faith and religion.
In the past and still the present, people were persecuted for their
beliefs. The Inquisitor had the distinction of judging those who were
deemed sinners or witches. We wanted to capture that feel with the
hypnotic chorus.
"Fear of things invisible is the natural seed
of that which everyone in himself calleth religion"

"Glory"
This song was originally meant as a small piece to complement the record.
After a few rehearsals it turned into a very Baroque and moving piece. We
envisioned a String Quartet to complement the arrangements and that just
what we did. The final result for us was beautiful.
"The paths of glory lead but to the grave."

"Until Kingdom Come"
A man's soul mate has died and he is struggling with reality with out her.
Her ghost appears to him in dreams to comfort his fears and one day they
will reunite. Another fast uptempo tune that we will be incorporating more
with the new drummer.
"Death is more universal than life; everyone dies but not everyone lives"

"Lunar Sanctum"
This is more of an experimental song for us. Different than any on the
record, the lyrics are very ambiguous. We want to see what the fans read
into the meaning. Overall the song caps off a CD full of energy and
dedication to staying true to ourselves and our fans.
"There is something haunting in the light of the moon; it has all
the dispassionateness of a disembodied soul, and something of its
inconceivable mystery".

1. Prologue
"All that you see or seem, is but a dream within a dream"
[Edgar Allan Poe]

2. Center Of The Universe
Move slowly
Beyond the colors of my eyes
Move slowly
Into the corners of my mind
Rising like the Pegasus
Each and every one of us
Released
Islands in the sea of dreams
Always searching harmony
And peace

All we find
Reject our mind
Don't you wonder why

If the war by heavens gate released desire
In the line of fire someone must have known
That a human heart demands to be admired
Cause in the Center of the Universe
We are all alone

Show me sign of paradise
A place we all would like to go to
Tell me what to sacrifice
So there's a chance for me to want you

All I find
Reject my mind
And I wonder why

If the war by heavens gate released desire
In the line of fire someone must have known
That a human heart demands to be admired
Cause in the Center of the Universe
We are all alone

I have a tale to be told won't you listen tonight
Follow me into the core of the fountain of light
Try to imagine that hope is our ship for the soul
(Over the ocean the quest of your life lies ahead)
Maybe together we'll find there's a place for us all
(Follow the star in your mind, sail along sail along)

3. Farewell
Winter's close...and the mountain high
I'll start my journey now
On this planet we call Earth we belong
I want to know
Why did God make me feel
There is more to be answered
Maybe God cannot remedy
Our souls if he tried
I seek peace of mind at least
And to know I did my best
I will pray for those I have loved

I must take your farewell
Carried by destiny
Bound to obey

I must take your farewell
Trails of discovery
Lead me an ocean away

No one holds the only truth in his hand
So who am I
To defy even God
In quest for a reason
There's no time to waste I'm afraid

I must take your farewell
Carried by destiny
Bound to obey

I must take your farewell
Trails of discovery
Lead me an ocean away
So far away

When the tide is high
I won't dwell or wait no longer

4. Interlude I (Opiate Soul)
Dulcissimae... oh Fortuna... Venit Meos..
[English translation: "Oh sweet fortune... Mine has come"]

5. The Edge Of Paradise
Sleepless
Not really quite awake
Where the soul conforms
To deeper needs
Free within frames of custody
I revolve my spirit and exhale

On the edge of paradise
Poison burning
In my veins
Unavailing...compromised
My dreams remain the same

Soothing but yet so violent
In this world within the other world
Moonlight...in visions...heaven sent
I see demon eyes and wings unfurled

On the edge of paradise
Poison burning
In my veins
Unavailing...compromised
My dreams remain the same

On the edge of paradise
Powerless
I sail on by
Undermining life itself
My will to wonder why

6. Wander
I recall one summer's night
Within the month of June
Flowers in mahogany hair
And smell of earth in bloom
Only such a melody
Comes without a sound
More than faintly heard by those
Who know what they have found
Now it's just a memory

Silently we wander
Into this void of consequence
My shade will always haunt her
But she will be my guiding light

Silently we wander
In search of truth and confidence
So many hopes were lost here
Along the way
From morning to night

Meet me by the wishing well
In cover of the moon
Whisper to me tenderly
That I will see you soon
Sing that song from long ago
So I remember you
Flowers in mahogany hair
And mellow days in June
Only for the memory

Silently we wander
Into this void of consequence
My shade will always haunt her
But she will be my guiding light

Silently we wander
In search of truth and confidence
So many hopes were lost here
Along the way
From morning to night

From ashes we were born
In silence we unite

7. Interlude II (Omen)

8. Descent Of The Archangel
[MEPHISTO:]
Speak my friend
You look surprised
I thought you knew
I'd come disguised
On angel wings...in white
I can make
Your dreams come true
What a couple...
Me and you
On journey through the night

I will show you everything so vividly
You can't deny me

Bathed in moonlight
I'm proclaimed by angels cry
Think well
Do take your time
Because your soul
Will be mine the day you die

Name a pleasure
One...a few
Any form
Of lust in you
Will tremble at my touch
I come down from heaven's light
I have all the perfect alibis
There's so much...

I will show you everything so vividly
You won't deny me

Bathed in moonlight
I'm proclaimed by angels cry
Think well
Do take your time
Because your soul
Will be mine the day you die

Call my name or carry on
Till that last resistance' gone
I'm sure we'll meet again

I'm your true disciple
When the flesh desires
You won't deny me

9. Interlude III (At The Banquet)
[ARIEL:]
His invitation was clear
I shut my eyes...and now I'm here

[MASTER OF CEREMONIES:]
Please make way,
our host is making his entree

10. A Feast For The Vain
[MEPHISTO:]
Everyone is here
The feast can soon begin
Vanity we celebrate
My favourite of sins

[ARIEL:]
Chandeliers so grand
That heaven sees the shine
And my friend declares
Everything I look at could be mine
It's a miracle
Life till now has been a waste
You have proved to me
By your hand I'm truly graced
Unbelievable
Gold and glitter blinding me
So adorable
All these women from my fantasies

[MEPHISTO:]
Come with me my little ones
Let's revel for the free
Raise your glass and praise the fact
How easy life can be

[ARIEL/EVERYBODY:]
In the splendour of the night
I've found company
Once again I feel that life's begun
All the wrongs seem to be right
Drowned in ecstasy
Every star is like a newborn sun

May the life I knew be gone
I accept the deed
But one point we have to modify
If I wish to linger on
In a state of still
Only then I'm yours the day I die

11. On The Coldest Winter Night
I am breathless,
Need I say
How could you find me here?
You, of all, have crossed my way
Unexpectedly...from where?
I feel like I am dreaming
Hold me close,
Tomorrow may be gone

This is a moment of belief
This is a moment made of dreams
You found me here today
On the coldest winter night
This moment is our right

Now, Helena tell me all
The years we've been apart...
Did you hear the mountain fall?
...my broken heart
Don't wake me if I'm dreaming
Hush, my dear
Because tomorrow may be gone

Lost in the present, I am sure
This is the moment, say no more
You found me here today
On the coldest winter night
This moment is our right

This is a moment of belief
This is a moment made of dreams
You found me here today
On the coldest winter night
This moment is our right

12. Lost & Damned
Helena you came to me
When seemingly life had begun
Little did I know then
Where this would go
When this begun
Once I was free to fly...
I never promised anything
This may well be goodbye

Don't ask why
Don't be sad
Sometimes we all
Must alter paths we planned
Only try understand
I want to save you
From the lost and damned

Although you hold me close
I feel retention arise
Just as a hint of fear
Like subtle clouds
In summer skies
Once in the moonlight...
I can't explain
And I don't know
Somehow we may reunite

Don't ask why
Don't be sad
Sometimes we all
Must alter paths we planned
Don't forget what we had
But let me save you
From the lost and damned

Love means nothing to me
If there is a higher place to be

Helena don't you cry
Believe me; I do this for you
Heed my decision now
I will be gone tomorrow noon
My tale has just begun
Nothing can take my faith away
In my quest for the sun

Don't ask why
Don't be sad
Sometimes we all
Must alter paths we planned
Only try understand
I try to save you
From the lost and damned

Don't ask why
Don't be sad
Sometimes we all
Must alter paths we planned
Leave me behind, don't look back
Because deep within you know
I'm lost and damned

13. Helena's Theme
[HELENA:]
I remember a song
From long ago
Some of the pieces
They remind me of you
How could I know
You were to leave me
I thought that I was that melody
Oh so wrong
I'm but a whisper tonight

And if this is goodbye
I will leave
But I'll love you
Until the end

[RIVER SPIRIT:]
If the grace of God is real
And the word of Christ can heal
Bring their souls to heaven's light
Bless the unborn child tonight

14. Interlude IV (Dawn)
[TOWN CRIER:]
Hear ye hear ye! The lady
Helena has committed a sin.
Now death lies on her, like an
untimely frost upon the
sweetest flower of all the field...

15. The Mourning After (Carry On)
I just had a dream
She was by the riverside
Alone and dressed in white
Paling in the cold
Walking on the icy face
On memories of glory days

Carry on
Carry on
Meet me on the other side
Once the mourning after turns to day

Carry on
Carry on
Keep on to the other side
The mourning after slowly fades

How could I have known
Just the thought is simply wild
In her womb...a little child
I am left to roam
On the surface of a dream
In a world that can't be seen

Carry on
Carry on
Meet me on the other side
Once the mourning after turns to day

Carry on
Carry on
Keep on to the other side
The mourning after slowly fades

Carry on
Carry on
Just you carry on
Till the mourning is over

Carry on
Carry on
Just you carry on
Till the mourning after leaves

Carry on
Carry on
Meet me on the other side
Once the mourning after turns to day

Carry on
Carry on
Keep on to the other side
The mourning after slowly fades

16. III Ways To Epica
[MEPHISTO:]
When you play with fire
You must anticipate some burns
Chasing for desire...
It's just a different way to learn

[ARIEL:]
I am defected from God
[HELENA:]
God had seized my soul
[ARIEL:]
So low redemptions too far
[HELENA:]
I am heaven's sheen
[ARIEL:]
She's the one that I loved
[HELENA:]
Love is all we know
[ARIEL:]
And she tore me apart
[HELENA:]
The dark can never win

[MEPHISTO:]
All that I require
Is some trust as the pages turn
I can take you higher
Cause your will is my concern

[ARIEL:]
I am defected from God
[HELENA:]
God had seized my soul
[ARIEL:]
So low redemptions too far
[HELENA:]
I am heaven's sheen
[ARIEL:]
She's the one that I loved
[HELENA:]
Love is all we know
[ARIEL:]
And she tore me apart
[HELENA:]
The dark can never win

[ARIEL:]
So long...maybe forever
I must carry on
Why did God take away
That one thing I wanted
Maybe God is the melody
We all serenade

[MEPHISTO:]
You would not feel sadness
If you never tasted joy
That's the curse of humans
Born in passion you destroy

17. Snow
I never count on yesterday
Because the past can also change
I'll never give myself away
Life is worthwhile on the edge
Words sound so hollow in the cold
Maybe she's forgotten all

I don't remember how
I felt the night she came
Memories spin around
They flow
Don't want to let her down
Moments disappear like shame...like snow

Signs never told me anything
Nothing I could know for sure
I never knew what she would bring
Or what I am to her today
My words...
Almost swallowed by the snow
Maybe she's forgotten all

I don't remember how
I felt the night she came
Memories spin around
They flow
Don't want to let her down
Moments disappear like shame...like snow

She is the poison in my mind
The thorns in my head
She has no mountain to be climbed
No faults to regret

I never count on yesterday
Because the past may not exist
I'll never give myself away
When there's reason to resist
Words draped in crystals melt away

I don't remember how
I felt the night she came
Memories spin around
They flow
Don't want to let her down
Moments disappear like shame...like snow

18. Like The Shadows
[Japan Bonus Track]

Like the shadows cover me
Rising from my ecstasy...

In a glimpse from a quiet childhood
I recall a mother's smile
Nothing needs to be understood,
I am free

In the deep of a distant forest
I'll lose my sense of time
Where the words of the wind is honest,
I can breathe

Someone told me there's a higher mountain
But I'll wait here for a while
Only led by the deepest hunger,
I'll flee from exile

[Chorus]
Like the shadows cover me
You're behind me once again
Rising from my ecstasy
Rising from my pain

Like the shadows follow me
You can wash my steps away
Not the one I want to be
But still somehow the same

1. Regalis Apertura
[Instrumental]

2. Forever
there's a pain within
that I can't define
there's an empty space
where your love used to shine
from the night we met
till the day you died
do you think I wished
do you still believe I tried
all too soon we were divided
and life had just begun

will you revive
from the chaos in my mind
where we still are bound together
will you be there
waiting by the gates of dawn
when I close my eyes forever

I belong to you
you belong to me
it's the way things are
always meant to be

like the morning star
and the rising sun

you convey my life
and forgive me what I've done

all too soon we were divided
into darkness and light

will you revive
from the chaos in my mind
where we still are bound together
will you be there
waiting by the gates of dawn
when I close my eyes forever

save me
reverse how I'm thinking of you
every breath I take
brings me closer
closer to forever, to you
I'm waiting for the day that I'm gone

3. Wings Of Despair
sometimes my visions
are distant and vague
down at the base
of the mountain
once in a while I am
weak and afraid
tired and sick of it all
I don't believe
that my story is set
nothing is destined
or blatant
bound to this body
a world full of hate
no one will heed if I fall

no one can see it
but you know that it's there
guiding the steps of your soul
holding the truth
in the cross that you bear
die with a heart that is bold

fly on the wings of despair
no one is holding you back
the call of the wild is internal
conquer the silence you fear
tomorrow will not fade to black
a new day is dawning
remember
no one can save you today

the questions are more
than the answers I know
that doesn't mean you are lonely
searching for more
consecutive goal's
making it worth to go on

no one can see it
but you know that it's there
guiding the steps of your soul
holding the truth
in the cross that you bear
die with a heart that is bold

fly on the wings of despair
no one is holding you back
the call of the wild is internal
conquer the silence you fear
tomorrow will not fade to black
a new day is dawning
remember
no one can save you today

you, and you alone
is forging the path
leave your sorrows with the past

never believe
that the story is set
nothing is destined
or blatant
bound to this body
a world full of hate
no one will heed if you fall

4. The Spell
where has all the magic gone
lost behind or lost along
a victim of the pulse of our society
don't you miss the ancient times
the riddles and the subtle signs
a relative perspective on reality
I get stronger in the splendor
of a lucid moon
only creatures of the night

all my demons cast a spell
the souls of dusk rising from the ashes
so the book of shadows tell
the weak will always obey the master

heading for the dragons lair
another time and a different sphere
I leave the nothingness behind
and when the sense of logic yields
I'll escape the outer shields
into the universal mind

I get stronger in the splendor
of a lucid moon
only creatures of the night
can heal my wounds

5. Don't You Cry
[Dedicated to the memory of Thomas Youngblood Sr.]

little by little
I've come to this point
on my own I've been searching my way
I lost you so early
the days went so fast
you don't know how I prayed every day

a song to remember
a song to forget
you'll never know how I tried
to make you proud
and to honor your name but
you never told me goodbye

now that your are gone
casting shadows from the past
you and all the memories will last

don't you cry
or suffer over me
I will be waiting for you
don't you cry
angels never fade away
I'll be watching over you
see you through

now I'm a man and
I'm feeling you still
could it be you were there all along
a time to surrender
a time to forgive
with solace I give you this song

now that you are gone
casting shadows from the past
in my dreams I hear your voice at last

don't you cry
or suffer over me
I will be waiting for you
don't you cry
angels never fade away
I'll be watching over you
see you through

I can see you tonight
in the pale winter light
father and son again
the bond of blood will never end

6. Karma
I am a king of honor
gold and glory
but every king must also die
have I been just and righteous
what is glory
I know I've torn and taken life
and here I stand
a small and simple man

who will trade his karma for my kingdom
a sacrificial rite to render truth
the fire in my soul rejects my wisdom
cause all you do in life comes back to you

I am a king in crisis
counting minutes
there is an ending to my reign
my sins have come to face me
I can feel it
that I have lived my life in vain
and now I know I'll reap
the seeds I've sown

who will trade his karma for my kingdom
a sacrificial rite to render truth
the fire in my soul rejects my wisdom
cause all you do in life comes back to you

am I mad
I feel so void and cold
who can tell
who holds the stories untold
tired and trembling
I am descending
will I have to stay here
and live this life again

7. The Light I Shine On You
yet a day is dawning
I am sad but also strong
this gift that I've been given
tells me where I do belong
falling I'm falling down
and you recall my strength
time will slowly pull me under
but you will catch my breath

this is a praise to all of you

cause the light I shine on you
is what you gave to me
I'm a crystal clear and true
I'm your cairn and creed

you think that I'm a mountain
but there's a price I have to pay
for the love I have forsaken
can never be replaced

crying I'm crying out
be careful with my soul
unbounded I'm like water
but so fragile in the cold
and this is a praise to all of you

cause the light I shine on you
is what you gave to me
I'm a crystal clear and true
I'm your cairn and creed

the mysteries of life
take us high and low
the road can be long
it seems
someone is lost
but no one is free

falling I'm falling down
into your open arms
each and every gathered glow
maintains my shining star

this is a praise to all of you...

8. Temples Of Gold
I see you when it snows
in crystals dancing down
from a sultry sky
when silence is pure and unbreakable
I can see you smiling
in every frozen tear
I can hear you whisper "You and I?

little did we know
that they were life itself
the days passing by
we both had our share in the sacrifice

once upon a time
we had something beautiful
once upon a time
I thought "you and I?

take me wherever
the answer lingers in the sand
show me the way as the story unfolds
love is remote
in this wailing winter wonderland
show me the way to the temples of gold

bless me with a kiss
across the universe
when day and night converge
and whisper my name till I fall asleep

tell me tales from days bygone
tell me little lies
tell me once again it's just "you and I?

9. Across The Highlands
I've been witness to so many wars
that I'm blind to affliction
no ability left to remorse
it's my faith and conviction
wide awake
in this world
full of hate
I unfurl

but I am damned
if life itself is condemnation
I am immortal
thus my freedom is captivity
flying all across the highlands
searching for a way
to finalize my history
rising high above the mountains
reaching for the sky
closer to my sanctuary

all my life I've been trying to die
reach complete segregation
I am ready to open my eyes
to a new revelation

lost in time
there's no place
for my soul
in his embrace

for I am damned
if life itself is condemnation
I am immortal
thus my freedom is captivity
bound to live eternally

However; the line thus my freedom is captivity is incorrect.
the correct line for the second and third time they sing this
bridge is:

I am immortal
and I can't escape my destiny.
Bound to live eternally

10. Elizabeth: I. Mirror Mirror
mirror can you tell me
how to stay forever young
let me know the secret
I will hold my twisted tongue
please protect my beauty
velvet skin so pure and white
hear my name resounding
like a hymn at dead of night

once I struck a servant
she's a virgin free from sin
drops of blood caressed me
and refined my aging skin

could this be the answer
uncorrupted carmine red
voices keep resounding
in my dazed bewildered head

have I found myself eternity
someone has heard my prayers
now I'll become divine

have I found myself divinity
I'm no longer a slave
to the vicious hands of time

11. Elizabeth: II. Requiem For The Innocent
mother can you hold me
one more time again
whisper "I still love you? in my ear
mother did you lie
would you tell me why
there is something deeper that I fear
justify the malice I portray
daggers in the darkness find your way
when the moon is full and piercing bright
drench me with your innocence tonight

don't you want to die
walk beside me evermore
don't you feel alive
like you've never felt before

visions of the future
unprofound and blurred
I have passed the point of no return

justify the malice I portray
let me keep my beauty one more day
when the moon is full and piercing bright
drench me with your innocence tonight
don't you want to die
walk beside me evermore
don't you feel alive
like you've never felt before

don't you want to die
souls transcending, silver shine
don't you feel alive
your blood preserves my place in time

12. Elizabeth: III. Fall From Grace
breathe in deep
smell these halls of hate
carve your name into these walls
before it is too late
cold and twisted
they resisted
what was I to do
all I ever wanted was
a fraction of the truth

walking in the shadows
of my blackened mind
lost inside this shallow
vanity of time

what if there's a God a hell and heaven
fire is the torment I must face
dying by the souls I have forsaken
no one's going to catch my fall from grace

(bleed on me)
watch me from your cage
as I rejoin my painful prime
(suffer and exhale)
you and I are relics
we provoke and we recline

walking in the shadows
of my blackened mind
angels crave my sorrow
sorrow they will find

what if there's a God a hell and heaven
fire is the torment I must face
dying by the souls I have forsaken
no one's going to catch my fall from grace

walking in the shadows
of my blackened mind
angels crave my sorrow
sorrow they will find

13. Ne Pleure Pas
[French Bonus]
[dédié à la mémoire de Thomas Youngblood sén.]

si lentement
arrivé à ce point
sans personne
j'ai tracé mon chemin
toi sorti de ma vie
le temps passe si vite
tu n'sais pas mes prières chaque jour

chanson aux mémoires
chanson à l'oubli
sans adieu tu partais
tous mes efforts
pour te rendre si fier
jamais tu ne les voyais

toi parti d'ici
oh, les ombres du passé
ton souvenir me consolait

ne pleure pas
ni souffre pour moi
un jour on se trouvera
ne pleure pas
les anges nous protégeront
je te garde dans mon coeur
à jamais

homme maintenant
je te sens près de moi
étais-tu avec moi malgré tout
le temps de se rendre
le temps du pardon
consolé je te donne ma chanson

toi parti d'ici
oh, les ombres du passé
dans mes rêves enfin il y a ta voix

ne pleure pas
ni souffre pour moi
un jour on se trouvera
ne pleure pas
les anges nous protégeront
je te garde dans mon coeur

je te revois ce soir
dans la pâleur d'hiver
père et fils ensemble
les liens du sang
tiendront toujours

14. Once And Future King
[Japan Bonus]

long time ago
the seed was sown
a child born in Uther's name
concieved in sin
the future King
a new realm of truth proclaimed

they came from far
to meet this man
they saw he was just and wise
the flags unfold
the fires rise
reflecting the hate in his eyes

fighting for the crown
pride and honor to be found

born from sin
into Merlin's hand
once and future king
vowed to return again

in moonlit haze
among the hills
Sir Mordred, Morgana's shade
would slay his king
forever cling
to darkness his powers fade

fighting for the crown
pride and honor to be found

born from sin
into Merlin's hand
once and future king
vowed to return again

Bedivere, my best of knights
this sword I beg you take
to the place where it belongs
and throw it in the lake

into the war
forever more
the nation follow the chosen one
as when alive
his will survives
to rest on the island of Avalon

2. The Black Halo
Come wind come snow come winter land
I have resigned myself to death
Come will to show the heathen hand
So I can draw my final breath

You could take me higher
So you said I trusted you
I may be a liar
But betrayal lies on you

I could feel where the journey ends
Final cough of a last defense

Darkness come tonight
I have no fear of what you hold
Darkness come alive
You are the stories I've been told

I possess a power
Of survival in the cold
Life is like a flower
As it stumbles out of fold

We all know when the time has come
This is where I will linger on

Darkness come tonight
I have no fear of what you hold
Darkness come alive
You are the stories I've been told

Darkness come tonight
Nothing can take my faith away
Darkness come alive
Life turns to black from silver gray

Darkness come tonight
I have no fear of what you hold
Darkness come alive
You are the stories I've been told

Darkness come tonight
Nothing can take my faith away
Darkness come alive
Life turns to black from silver gray

3. Soul Society
If my soul could revive
From my carnal remains
What does it matter to me
If it all fades to black
If I'm born once again
Then no one really is free

How could I be condemned
For the things I have done
If my intentions were good
I guess I'll never know
Some things under the sun
Can never be understood

How can we believe in heaven
Human reason counters all
My tears are soul society
My life is just a fragment
Of the universe and more
There must be more than I can see

In the dark we're the same
In the concept of time
We're like a grain in the sand
And we sprout from the flame
As if death was a rain
'Cause we can not understand

How I wish there was a heaven
All for one and one for all
A flawless soul society
Our lives are just a fragment
Of the universe and more
There may be more than we can see

How I could I be condemned
For the things that I've done
If my intentions were good
I guess I'll never know
Some things under the sun
Can never be understood

How can we believe in heaven
All for one and one for all
My tears are soul society
Our lives are just a fragment
Of the universe and more
And maybe more than we can see

4. The Edge Of Paradise
Sleepless...
Not really quite awake
Where the soul conforms
To deeper needs
Free within frames of custody
I revolve my spirit and exhale

On the edge of paradise
Poison burning
In my veins
Unavailing...compromised
My dreams remain the same

Soothing but yet so violent
In this world within the other world
Moonlight...in visions...heaven sent
I see demon eyes and wings unfurled

On the edge of paradise
Poison burning
In my veins
Unavailing...compromised
My dreams remain the same

On the edge of paradise
Powerless
I sail on by
Undermining life itself
My will to wonder why

5. Center Of The Universe
Move slowly
Beyond the colors of my eyes
Move slowly
Into the corners of my mind
Rising like the Pegazus
Each and every one of us
Released
Islands in the sea of dreams
Always searching harmony
And peace

All we find
Reject our mind
Don't you wonder why

If the war by heavens gate released desire
In the line of fire someone must have known
That a human heart demands to be admired
But in the Center of the Universe
We are all alone

Show me the sign of paradise
A place we all would like to go to
Tell me what to sacrifice
So there's a chance for me to want you

All we find
Reject our mind
Don't you wonder why

If the war by heavens gate released desire
In the line of fire someone must have known
That a human heart demands to be admired
But in the Center of the Universe
We are all alone

I have a tale to be told won't you listen tonight
Follow me into the core of the fountain of light
Try to imagine that hope is our ship for the soul
(Over the ocean the quest of your life lies ahead)
Maybe together we'll find there's a place for us all
(Follow the star in your mind, sail along sail along)

6. Nights Of Arabia
Came across
The waters
A kingdom in the sands
Unfaithful to the sultan
A killing was at hand
Challenged to survival
A legacy of fear
Eternal mystic legends
One for every tear

Nights of Arabia
The queen has lost her right to life
Nights of Arabia
Her destiny in story lines
Nights of Arabia
A thousand tales and one for life
These are nights of Arabia

Whispers in the moonlight
A gathering of vales
Circled round the fire
To hear this evenings tale
Standing on the threshold
The crest of darkened nights
Seduction of the hunter
The slave regains her might

"Lost inside a shadow
Erase the sins I've made
Heavenly reward me
With mercy on my fate"

Nights of Arabia
The queen has lost her right to life
Nights of Arabia
Her destiny in story lines
Nights of Arabia
A thousand tales and one for life
These are nights of Arabia
Scheherazade will never die

The sultan relents his feeble heart
His love for the queen is greater than he'll ever know
"It's easy to let you feed my nights
Someone to touch, someone to hold,
Someone to feel, someone to love"

"Here I am to die alone
Voices from heaven above
Hear my call awaken my soul
Forgive me for what I have done"

Challenged to survival
A legacy of fear
Eternal mystic legends
One for every tear

7. Abandoned
Once my life was plain and clear
I recall once my ignorance was bliss
Nightfall came like a serpent's kiss
To my troubled mind

Why, oh why, my god
Have you abandoned me
In my sobriety
Behind the old facade
I'm your bewildered child
So take me across the river wide

Binding promises were made on my soul
Grand illusions led astray
Ice cold winds swept my heart away
Bring me back to you

Why, oh why, my god above
Have you abandoned me
In my sobriety
Behind the old facade
I'm your bewildered child
So take me across the river wide

8. Forever
There's a pain within
That I can't define
There's an empty space
Where your love used to shine
From the night we met
Till the day you died
Do you think I wished
Do you still believe I tried

All too soon we were divided
And life had just begun

Will you revive
From the chaos in my mind
Where we still are bound together
Will you be there
Waiting by the gates of dawn
When I close my eyes forever

I belong to you
You belong to me
It's the way things are
Always meant to be

Like the morning star
And the rising sun

You convey my life
And forgive me what I've done

All too soon we were divided
In darkness and light

Will you revive
From the chaos in my mind
Where we still are bound together
Will you be there
Waiting by the gates of dawn
When I close my eyes forever

Save me
Reverse how I'm thinking of you
Every breath I take
Brings me closer
Closer to forever, to you
I'm waiting for the day that I'm gone

9. Keyboard Solo

10. The Haunting (Somewhere In Time)
Maybe the sound of your voice
Made me believe that that you were her
Just like the river disturbs
My inner peace

Once I believed I could find
Just a trace of her beloved soul
Once I believed she was all
Then she smothered my beliefs

One cold winter's night
I may follow her voice to the river
Leave me for now and forever
Leave what you can

Somewhere in time I will find you and haunt you again
Like the wind sweeps the earth
Somewhere in time when no virtues are left to defend
You've fallen deep

I was a liar in every debate
I drew the forces that fueled your hate
When the cold in my heart leaves it comes to an end
Quietly now go to sleep

How could that first time recur
When memories linger on and on
What made me think you were her
Helena is dead to all dead to all

Nothing can bring her to life
Don't pretend that I've been loving you
Once I believed she was gone
I corrupted from within

Leave leave me for now and forever
Leave what you can

Somewhere in time I will find you and haunt you again
Like the wind sweeps the earth
Somewhere in time when no virtues are left to defend
You've fallen deep

I was a liar in every debate
I drew the forces that fueled your hate
When the cold in my heart leaves it comes to an end
Quietly now go to sleep

Follow me into the light
Dance on a lake of tears
I'll take you through
Or leave me tonight
I've gone too far to begin all anew
With someone like you

Somewhere in time I will find you and love you again
Like the wind sweeps the earth
Somewhere in time when no virtues are left to defend
You've fallen deep

I was a liar in every debate
I drew the forces that fueled your hate
When the cold in my heart leaves it comes to an end
Quietly I'll go to sleep

11. Moonlight
I have never craved the system's sympathy
I get restless over pity smiles
Some precaution wouldn't harm my history
If I had the will to wait a little while

You cut the silence like a knife
You know I can't repent for

Moonlight falling over me
Sail on where the shadows hide
Moonlight crawling down on me
Just like you could not compete with my pride

Compensation for a misconducted life
Is it way too much to ask
Hard to wake up with your heart and soul deprived
When the morning comes to second to your last

You cut the silence like a knife
Like the edge of my last defenses
You cut the silence like a knife
You know I won't repent for

Moonlight falling over me
Sail on where the shadows hide
Moonlight crawling down on me
Just like you could not compete with my pride

Shine on silver
From the sky into the night
Guide on shivers
And I need your bleeding light

Moonlight falling over me
Sail on where the shadows hide
Moonlight crawling down on me
Just like you could not compete with my pride

Moonlight falling over me
Sail on where the shadows hide
Moonlight crawling down on me
Just like you could not compete with the pride

12. When The Lights Are Down
Rules without exceptions last eternally
Every move you make creates your destiny

I've come to soak my sorrow
In hate as black
As black as the seed of my soul

'Cause when the lights are down
There's no more to say
Love is the real pain
An eternal revolution in my heart
And when the lights are down
You're so far away
Tell me your real name
In the silence of the darkness we unite

Rules without exceptions last eternally
Every move you make creates your destiny

What can protect me from the past
And all the things that I have done
She told me
And then she went out

But when the lights are down
There's no more to say
Deep in the shadows
Where the last of my delusions
Make their stand
'Cause when the lights are down
She'll take me away
Tell me her real name
In death we'll live the love
We never had

Wellcome all you faithful
Meet the moon
Meet the moon
Into the body as one
Marching on

'Cause when the lights are down
There's no more to say
Love is the real pain
An eternal revolution in my heart
'Cause when the lights are down
She'll take me away
Tell me her real name
In death we'll live the love
We never had

13. Elizabeth (Part I, II & III)
[Part I: Mirror Mirror]

Mirror can you tell me
How to stay forever young
Let me know the secret
I will hold my twisted tongue

Please protect my beauty
Velvet skin so pure and white
Hear my name resounding
Like a hymn at dead of night

Once I struck a servant
She's a virgin free from sin
Drops of blood caressed me
And refined my aging skin

Could this be the answer
Uncorrupted carmine red
Voices keep resounding
In my dazed bewildered head

Have I found myself eternity
Someone has heard my prayers
Now I'll become divine

Have I found myself divinity
I'm no longer a slave
To the vicious hands of time

[Part II: Requiem Of The Innocent]

Mother can you hold me
One more time again
Whisper "I still love you" in my ear
Mother did you lie
Would you tell me why
There is something deeper that I fear

Justify the evil I portray
Daggers in the darkness find your way
When the moon is full and piercing bright
Drench me with your innocence tonight

Don't you want to die
Walk beside me evermore
Don't you feel alive
Like you've never felt before
Visions of the future
Unprofound and blurred
I have passed the point of no return

Justify the evil I portray
Let me keep my beauty one more day
When the moon is full and piercing bright
Drench me with your innocence tonight
Don't you want to die
Walk beside me evermore
Don't you feel alive
Like you've never felt before

Don't you want to die
Souls transcending, silver shine
Don't you feel alive
Your blood preserves my place in time

[Part III: Fall From Grace]

Breathe in deep
Smell these halls of hate
Carve your name into these walls
Before it is too late

Cold and twisted
They resisted
What was I to do
All I ever wanted was
A fraction of the truth

Walking in the shadows
Of my blackened mind
Lost inside this shallow
Vanity of time

What if there's a God a hell and heaven
Fire is the torment I must face
Dying by the souls I have forsaken
No one's going to catch my fall from grace

[Bleed on me]
Watch me from your cage
As I rejoin my painful prime
[Suffer and exhale]
You and I are relics
We provoke and we recline

Walking in the shadows
Of my blackened mind
Angels crave my sorrow
Sorrow they will find

What if there's a God a hell and heaven
Fire is the torment I must face
Dying by the souls I have forsaken
No one's going to catch my fall from grace

Walking in the shadows
Of my blackened mind
Angels crave my sorrow
Sorrow they will find

14. March Of Mephisto
You know just who I am
Don't be so distant
Cause when you're lost
I am solely there to share your grief

Wailing in you're sorrow
Is only my way to comfort you
Reminders of innocent youth
Waiting for morrow you're lonely
I name your solitude
I speak the truth

Now tell me all about you're pain
Down to the detail
Don't say it's love
Your frail heart feeds my contempt

Wailing in you're sorrow
Is only my way to comfort you
Reminders of innocent youth
Waiting for morrow you're lonely
I name your solitude
I speak the truth

Chase the heathen call
We belong... You and I
Unison in all you deny

I am the thorn in your side
That seeks accomplishment
Reminding the mortal of death
I am the spore of your pride
An angel heavensent
The master of all
I am the urge of the flesh...

15. Karma
I am a king of honor
Gold and glory
But every king must also die
Have I been just and righteous
What is glory
I know I've torn and taken life

And here I stand
A small and simple man

Who will trade his karma for my kingdom
A sacrificial rite to render truth
The fire in my soul rejects my wisdom
Cause all you do in life comes back to you

I am a king in crisis
Counting minutes
There is an ending to my reign
My sins have come to face me
I can feel it
That I have lived my life in vain
And now I know I'll reap
The seeds I've sown

Who will trade his karma for my kingdom
A sacrificial rite to render truth
The fire in my soul rejects my wisdom
Cause all you do in life comes back to you

Am I mad
I feel so void and cold
Who can tell
Who holds the stories untold
Tired and trembling
I am descending
Will I have to stay here
And live this life again

16. Drum Solo

17. Farewell
Winter's close...and the mountain high
I'll start my journey now
On this planet we call Earth we belong
I want to know
Why did god make me feel
There is more to be answered
Maybe god cannot remedy
Our souls is he tried
I seek piece of mind at least
And to know I did my best
I will pray for those I have loved

I must take your farewell
Carried by destiny
Bound to obey

I must take your farewell
Trails of discovery
Lead me an ocean away

No one holds the only truth in his hand
So who am I
To defy even god
In quest for a reason
There's no time to waste I'm afraid

I must take your farewell
Carried by destiny
Bound to obey

I must take your farewell
Trails of discovery
Lead me an ocean away
So far away

When the tide is high
I won't dwell or wait no longer

18. Outro

19. Epilogue
[Japanese Bonus Track]

One other year has left my life
One year bygone so soon
These were the days I sacrificed
These days were lived for you

Some came with winter in white
Some days were blown away
Some came with sultry summer nights
Some with October rain

Oh, how I long for utter silence
But who am I to know
When rain will turn to snow?
If life brings another day

1. Solitaire
[Instrumental]
2. Rule The World
When a new day reaches dawn
I feel it's worth the wait
But I tumble and I fall
When up against my fate

When the barricades come down
I build them up again
When I'm just about to drown
I still don't know the end

[Chorus:]
Sometimes I tremble
Like a little child
That faces morning
With a broken smile
Sometimes I crumble
When the shades unfurl
Sometimes I feel that
I could rule the world

[Solo]

When the morning comes alive
Release your love brigade
At the end of day it's night
To suck it up with hate

[Chorus x2]

(That faces morning
With a broken smile
Sometimes I crumble
When the shades unfurl
Sometimes I feel that
I could rule the world)

3. Ghost Opera
Walls so white
Where your sorrows have a name
And day is dark as night
There's no remorse and no redemption

Close the door
Can you hear the crowd is waiting?
For a last encore
Screaming out for my attention

Chanting my name

[Chorus:]
Welcome all to curtain call
At the opera
Raging voices in my mind
Rise above the orchestra
Like a crescendo of gratitude
This is my song

Like the dead
I am on the other side
They're howling in my head
There's no remorse and no redemption

Hush my dear
Let the music fill the night
And soon it's all we hear
Screaming out for my attention

Chanting my name
Chanting my name

[Chorus:]
Welcome all to curtain call
At the opera
Raging voices in my mind
Rise above the orchestra
Like a crescendo of gratitude

Don't wake me
Until it's over
I, I may be dreaming
And awake

[Solo]

Chanting my name
Chanting my name

[Chorus:]
Welcome all to curtain call
At the opera
Raging voices in my mind
Rise above the orchestra

Welcome all to curtain call
At the opera
Raging voices in my mind
Rise above the orchestra

4. The Human Stain
See the cemetery sky
Carmine red and deep
Watch the oceans rising high
It's the human stain

Talk about the growing hunger
Ask why with deep concerned
Don't you think the human races
Is ceaselessly vain

[Chorus:]
But it hurts to be
Alive my friend
In this silent tide
We're driftwood passing by

Don't you wish you
Were a child again
Just for a minute
Just for a minute more

Hear the ticking of a clock
The sound of life itself
No one really wants to die
To save the world

Tell me that you're torn asunder
From how we fail to learn
And tell me if the Earth goes under
Where's your anger now

[Chorus:]
So it hurts to
Be alive, my friend
In this masquerade where
All one day must die

Don't you wish you
Were unborn again
Just for a minute
Just for a minute more

[Solo]

Tic-Toc
The ticking at the tear asunder
The beating from a heart of stone
The loss of your divine prosperity

[Chorus:]
'Cause it costs to
Be alive, my friend
And this life that someone
Merely gave to you

That's the price you take
Minute by minute
You beg for a minute more

5. Blücher
Dim is the light of a war day
In the land of the undying sun
Hollow the silence around me
Distant the sound of a gun

Port side is close to the shore
I wonder where she is
Incoming shot cross the bow
Will she remember me

Wail my April moon
God forsaken soul
I remember you
Come with me tonight

Damned is the dawn of a new day
Revelations of death and despair
Frost misty waters around me
Frantic and naked the fear

Port side is close to the shore
Incoming shot cross the bow

Wail my April moon
God forsaken soul
I remember you
Come with me tonight

Say your prayers
Loud and clearly
All who still believe in god

6. Love You To Death
When they met she was fifteen
Like a black rose blooming wild
And she already knew she was gonna die

"What's tomorrow without you?
Is this our last goodbye"

She got weaker every day
As the autumn leaves flew by
Until one day, she told him,
"This is when I die"

"What was summer like for you?"
She asked him with a smile
"What's tomorrow without you?"
He silently replied

She said,

"I will always be with you
I'm the anchor of your sorrow
There's no end to what I'll do
'Cause I love you, I love you to death"

But the sorrow went too deep
The mountain fell too steep
And the wounds would never heal
'Cause the pain of the loss
was more than he could feel

He said,

"I will always be with you
By the anchor of my sorrow
All I know, or ever knew,
Is I love you, I love you to death"

"What's tomorrow without you?
Is this our last goodbye?"

[Solo]

"I will always be with you
I'm the anchor of your sorrow
There's no end to what I'll do
'Cause I love you"

7. Up Through The Ashes
So you can heal
They claim with conviction
You've got a crowd

So what's your appeal
Your voice, your predictions
They're getting loud

But if I let you die, you must forgive me

Raise me up, up through the ashes
(welcome the paradise you made)
Take me on, into the light

You want to die
Create a sensation
Be makin' the news

An eye for an eye
my king of creation
king of the Jews

Before I let you die, you must forgive me

Raise me up, up through the ashes
(welcome the paradise you made)
Take me on, into the light

[Solo]

Give me a sign of remorse
(I don't need your blood)
You will hang on the cross
For playing god

You the people must decide
The self-proclaimed prophet, or the novice murderer
The king or the convict, it's up to you
So tell me who's free to go

Raise me up, up through the ashes
(forgive my every sin)
Take me on, into the light
Raise me up, up through the ashes
Take me on, into the light

8. Mourning Star
On the fields you restore your beliefs,
Like an old man in church on a Sunday.
crawl the dirt on your elbows and knees,
Any minute you know you could die.

So come save us, turn water to wine,
Give me words of unfathomable wisdom
As I'm crossing the enemy's line,
Where the wounded and dead show the way.

(Show me the way)

Tell me when the night is gone,
Like washed away,
Make a wish beneath the mourning star.

How can there be a reason for war?
For the life of a human that suffers
I remember, I heard it before,
Tell me all when the new day begins.

(The new day begins)

Tell me when the night is gone,
Like washed away,
Make a wish beneath the mourning star.
When the victory is won,
The old cliché,
Underneath the same old mourning star.

[rest in peace all that be good]
why please tell me why
[rest in piece thy fatherhood]
You gave the world all this pain

Tell me when the man is gone,
Like washed away,
Make a wish beneath the mourning star.
When the victory is won,
The old cliché,
Underneath the same old mourning star.

9. Silence Of The Darkness
I don't dare to take it slowly,
Cause time may pass me by.
Restless like a newborn morning,
I am hard to satisfy.
Will you take me away?

In the silence of the darkness,
I can't pretend I'm wide awake,
Afraid I could go under.
In the silence of the darkness,
I stumble for the light of day,
But the journey never ends.

I can paint the world with flowers,
grown by heaven's gate.
and reckless like the stormy ocean,
I could cover them with hate.
But it all sounds the same.

In the silence of the darkness,
I can't pretend I'm wide awake,
Afraid I could go under.
In the silence of the darkness,
I stumble for the light of day,
But the journey never ends.

In the silence of the darkness,
I can't pretend I'm wide awake,
Afraid I could go under.
In the silence of the darkness,
I stumble for the light of day,
But the journey never ends.

10. Anthem
What's the miracle, if life itself is not?
Who am I to praise it's worth
With a hymn??
I may stumble over words that I forgot,
Just as life itself will slowly begin.

Sing me a song for the mountains to move,
Sing me the anthem of life,
Sing me the anthem of life.

I'm sceptical, I like my glass of wine,
I don't know your name, or what I am to do.
One day you'll wonder why I read between the lines,
And you will sing for me, the way I sang for you.

Sing me a song for the ocean to part,
Sing me the anthem of life,
Sing me the anthem of life,
Sing me the anthem of life.

So another page is turned,
Pray I understand what's happening,
But if anything, I do know this,
I'll be the best I can.

Sing me a song like the angels rejoice,
Sing me an anthem of life,
Sing me the anthem,
Sing me the anthem of life.

11. EdenEcho
First you said that you would never leave me
Merry were my days
Then you told me life is never easy
And left without a trace

But how come I want you
Like the soil yearns for the rain

Won't you light up
Won't you light up my life
Let my soul breathe
Tell me wrong tell me right
You're my mind cage
Like a mountain far away
You were always there
Dressed in summer white

You will never know how much I miss you
Or open to my fear
Find a maze I make my way through
and enter if you dare

How come I want you
Like the soil yearns for the rain

Won't you light up
Won't you light up my life
Let my soul breathe
Tell me wrong tell me right
You're my mind cage
Like a mountain far away
You were always there
Dressed in summer white

Remember my name
And paint the darkness with your light
Go sing your song for all the broken hearted
Like Eden echoes in my head
The unforgiven gave you all

Won't you light up
Won't you light up my life
Let my soul breathe
Tell me wrong tell me right
You're my mind cage
Like a mountain far away
You were always there
Dressed in summer white

12. The Pendulous Fall
[Limited Edition Bonus Track]

In a garden in a hand
Lies a key to shadow land
You're far from feeling strong
The worst begins

In the sediments of life
In the comfort of a knife
You hold your breath
And pray to god it won't take long

And you wonder where the rainbow ends
With its autumn setting sun

[Chorus:]
There's a way from it all
Though the chances are small
We'll come back again
Won't you think it over

Life is a pendulous fall
But maybe worth the pain
And soon enough we'll go
Where nobody can touch us

Like a mother you were aimed
And you gave her what she claimed
Just like a good old friend
In the abyss of the mind
You found all there is to find
Bet we all have broken hearts to mend

So you wonder where the rainbow ends
Where the world must have begun

[Chorus:]
There's a way from it all
Though the chances are small
We'll come back again
Won't you think it over

Life is a pendulous fall
But maybe worth the pain
And soon enough we'll go
Where nobody can touch us

[Solo]

[Chorus:]
There's a way from it all
Though the chances are small
We'll come back again
Won't you think it over

Life is a pendulous fall
But maybe worth the pain
And soon enough we'll go

Life is a pendulous fall
But maybe worth the pain
(So you wonder where the rainbow ends)
Where nobody can touch us

13. Season's End
[Japanese bonus track]

Once in my life
A second of eternity
Seems long in my mind
What used to be
Keep changing over time
Don't go
Please don't say it's over 'til it is

Don't say goodbye
Like we'd never meet again
Leave me a lie
At the season's end

Moments in time
Seems to be so long
In my old mind
My images of may
You gave me a sign
I took the chance
Of never looking back
I hope you understand

Don't say goodbye
Like we'd never meet again
Leave me a lie
At the season's end
Come lift the light
Into heaven with a song
Don't say goodbye
'Cause it's been so long

It's been so long
It's been so long

You gave me a sign
I took a chance
By never looking back
I hope you understand

I hope you don't say goodbye
Like we'd never meet again (Say goodbye...)
Leave me a lie
At the season's end (Season's end)
Come lift the light
Into heaven with a song (With a song...)
Don't say goodbye
'Cause it's been so long

It's been so long
So long

The fortune is smiling at our first effort,
let me lead you and you will be safe,
the voice of people, voice of god
for bigger glory of the god
to the infinity.

You know just who I am
Don't be so distant
Cause when you're lost
I am solely there to share your grief

Wailing for your sorrow
Is only my way to comfort you
Reminders of innocent youth
Waiting for morrow you're lonely
I name your solitude
I speaketh the truth

Now tell me all about your pain
Down to the detail
Don't say it's love
Your fragile heart feeds my contempt

Wailing for your sorrow
Is only my way to comfort you
Reminders of innocent youth
Waiting for morrow you're lonely
I name your solitude
I speaketh the truth

Chase the heathen call
We belong... you and I
Unison in all you deny

Wailing for your sorrow
Is only my way to comfort you
Reminders of innocent youth
Waiting for morrow you're lonely
I name your solitude
I speaketh the truth

I am the thorn in your side
That seeks accomplishment
Reminding the mortal of death
I am the spore of your pride
An angel heaven sent
The master of all
I am the urge of the flesh

2. When The Lights Are Down
Rules without exceptions last eternally
Every move you make creates your destiny
I've come to soak my sorrow in halo black
As black as the seal on my soul

Cause when the lights are down
There's no more to say
Love is the real pain
An internal revolution in our minds
And when the lights are down
You're so far away
Tell me your real name
In the silence of the darkness we unite

(Rules without exceptions last eternally
Every move you make creates your destiny)
What can protect me from the past
And all the things that I have done
She told me and then she was gone

But when the lights are down
There's no more to say
Deep in the shadows
Where the last of my delusions made a stand
Cause when the lights are down
She'll take me away
Tell me her real name
And in death we'll live the love we never had

Come all ye faithful beneath the moon
Into the void as one
Marching on

3. The Haunting (Somewhere In Time)
[with Simone Simons from EPICA]

Merely the sound of your voice
Made me believe that
that you were her
Just like the river disturbs
...my inner peace
Once I believed I could find
Just a trace of her beloved soul
Once I believed she was all
Then she smothered my beliefs

One cold winter's night
I may follow her voice to the river
Leave me for now and forever
Leave while you can

[Chorus:]
Somewhere in time
I will find you and haunt you again
Like the wind sweeps the earth
Somewhere in time
When no virtues are left to defend
You fall in deep

[Post chorus:]
I was a liar in every debate
I rule the forces that fueled your hate
When the cold in my heart leaves
It comes to an end
And quietly I'll go to sleep

How could that first time recur
When memories linger on and on
What made me think you were her
Helena is dead to all
dead to all
Nothing can bring her to life
Don't pretend that I'll be loving you
Once I believed she was gone
I'm corrupted from within
Leave me for now and forever
Leave while you can

[Chorus]

[Post chorus]

[Ariel]
Follow me into the light
Leave me tonight
I've gone too far to begin all anew
With someone like you

[Marguerite]
Like ice on a lake of tears
I'll take you through
Life fades in anew
With someone like you

[Chorus]

[Post chorus]

4. Soul Society
If my soul could revive
From my carnal remains
What does it matter to me
If it all fades to black
If I'm born once again
Then no one really is free
How could I be condemned
For the things that I've done
If my intentions were good
I guess I'll never know
Some things under the sun
Can never be understood

How can we believe in heaven
Human reason counters all
Ideas of a soul society
My life is just a fragment
Of the universe and all
There must be more than I can see

In the dark we're the same
In the concept of time
We're like a grain in the sand
And we strive for the flame
As if death was our aim
Cause we cannot understand

How I wish there was heaven
All for one and one for all
A flawless soul society
Our lives are just a fragment
Of the universe and all
There may be more than we can see

5. Interlude I: Dei Gratia
Sub sole nihil novi est
Ad aspera per aspera
Quærite prime regnum Dei
Ante bellum, memento mori

[English translation:]
Nothing new under the sun
to the stars through the thorns
At first seek the kingdom of the god
Remember the death before war.

6. Abandoned
Once my life was plain and clear
I recall
Once my ignorance was bliss
Nightfall came
Like a serpent's kiss
To my troubled mind

Why my God
Have you abandoned me
In my sobriety
Behind the old facade
I'm your bewildered child
So take me cross the river wide

Binding promises were made
On my soul
Grand illusions lead astray
Ice cold winds swept my heart away
Bring me back to you

[Helena]
I remember a song
Like in a dream
Where September was long
And winter unreal

Why my God above
Have you abandoned me
In my sobriety
Behind the old facade
I'm your bewildered child
So take me cross the river wide

7. This Pain
Pushing for the limit of sanity
Pushing for the surface
...so I can breathe
Dark is the night for us all, but some days
I feel the light crawling down from these jagged walls
Blessed sunlight

Some of this pain is sole subjected
But what was I to do
Some of this pain will always stay
Deep and true

I left her with a warning... without protection
'Cause the human nature has its ways with lust
With her back against the wall she crumbled
Just a minute more would have saved her life
And even so... part of me
Blessed sunlight

Some of this pain is sole subjected
But what was I to do
Some of this pain will always stay
Deep and true

I see her shame in my desire
It all took place too soon
Some of these wounds will always bleed
Over you

8. Moonlight
I have never craved the system's sympathy
I get restless over pity smiles
Some precaution wouldn't harm my history
If I had the will to wait a little while

You cut the silence like a knife
You know I can't repent for all

Moonlight falling over me
Sail on where the shadows hide
Moonlight crawling down on me
Just like you could not compete with my pride

Compensation for a misconducted life
Is it way too much to ask
Hard to wake up
With your heart and soul deprived
When the morning comes
The second to your last

You cut the silence like a knife
At the edge of my last defenses
You cut the silence like a knife
You know I won't repent for all

Moonlight falling over me
Sail on where the shadows hide
Moonlight crawling down on me
Just like you could not compete with my pride

Shine on silver from the sky into the night
Gaia shivers and I need your leading light

Moonlight falling over me
Sail on where the shadows hide
Moonlight crawling down on me
Just like you could not compete with my pride

9. Interlude II: Un Assassinio Molto Silenzioso
[Female Voice singing]

C'era una volta un uomo
Con gli occhi verso la luna
E si chiedeva:
"Verra presto l'amore?"
E che altro esiste
In un cuore gelato?
Tranne il pensiero
Di un assassinio molto silenzioso

[TRANSLATION]

[Once upon a time there was a man
With his eyes towards the moon
And he wonder to himself:
"Will love come soon?"
And does something else exist
In a frozen heart?
Except the thought of a
Very silent murder]

10. The Black Halo
Come wind
Come snow
Come winterland
I have resigned myself to death
Come will to show the hidden hand
So I can draw my final breath
You could take me higher
So you said and I trusted you
I may be a liar, but betrayal lies on you

I can feel when the journey ends
Final call for a last defense

Darkness come tonight
I have no fear of what you hold
Darkness come alive
You are the stories I've been told

I possess the power
Of survival in the cold
Life is like a flower
As it stumbles out of fall

We all know when our time has come
This is where I will linger on

Darkness come tonight
I have no fear of what you hold
Darkness come alive
You are the stories I've been told

Darkness come tonight
Nothing can take my faith away
Darkness come alive
Life fades to black from silver grey

11. Nothing Ever Dies
Here we are
Under the same old sun
All alone yet somehow bound and unified
Dust to dust...
Ashes to ashes won't take long
We search for a harbour
Somewhere to belong

They say that faith is all you need
To stay forever young
What you've sown is what you reap
Our sins can't be undone

There is a god in each society
So right is wrong where wrong is right
No one could be sure
Still we are certain
That what we know is truth
The only truth
We're building our temples taller

They say that faith is all you need
To stay forever young
What you've sown is what you reap
Our sins can't be undone

How can we trust them once again
They used to tell us lies
Their voices will sustain
Cause nothing ever dies

Love is the only truth
Pure as the well of youth
Until it breaks your heart
You took me higher
Than the mountains I have climbed
You waited all your life for me
You left me all alone behind
But we'll meet again
We will meet again

12. Memento Mori
Who wants to separate
The world we know from our beliefs
And who sees only black and white
Distinguish loss from sacrifice
Some day we may come to peace
With the world within ourselves
And I will await you
Until I close my eyes

When your time has come
You know you'll be lonely once again
And the final winter comes to us all
Life is treacherous
But you're not the only who must pretend

We're a second in time
We're the last in the line
Of the prey that walks the earth
Good and evil combined

I am the god in my own history
The master of the game
I may believe if she would come to me
And whisper out my name
Sometimes I wonder where the wind has gone
If life has ever been
Sometimes I wonder how belief alone
Can cut me free from sin

When you close your eyes
Mementos of summer retrieves your mind
Like a drizzle afternoon cleans the air
When the winter blows
You're glad you remember you really tried

And it comes to an end
Even winter... life fall
And we all have our beliefs
Pray for mercy for all

I am a man without a mystery
The deal is done within
I will embrace the coldest winter breeze
And pay for every sin

[Helena]
VICTORIA, NON PRAEDA
MEMENTO MORI

[Mephisto]
UNA VOCE... VOLO, NON VALEO
DULCE ET DECORUM EST
PRO PATRIA MORI
MEMENTO MORI

[Ariel]
So subservant in your embrace
No more denial
No run away
This is the final
My last recall
And that's the price for what we learn
The more we know the more we yearn
Cause we're so alone

I am a man without a mystery
The deal is done within
I will embrace the coldest winter breeze
The journey can begin
I'm still the god in my own history
I still believe that she will come to me
And whisper out my name

Some day we will come to peace
And reach beyond behind the lies
And I will await you
Until I close my eyes

13. Interlude III: Midnight - Twelve Tolls For A New Day
Life has never been better than it is right now (Happy new year)
And finally while I still have your attention
I want to wish you all a happy new year (Yahoo!)

Happy new year

14. Serenade
Songs of pain and soothing lullabies
Songs of happiness and some that make us cry
One song we share
The cross we all bear
One that segregates
One that unifies

All we wonder
No one ever denies
If once given life we must die

So bow down with me
Where summer fades into fall
And leave your hatchets of hate
Bow down with me
And sing the saddest of all
The song we all serenade

The more we know
The less we understand
Life... eternity
The savagery of man
We want it all
Aimed at the fall
What is destiny with the masterplan

All we wonder
No one ever denies
If once given life we must die

So bow down with me
Where summer fades into fall
And leave your hatchets of hate
Bow down with me
And sing the saddest of all
The song we all serenade

Hold on now
Don't leave don't let it go
Dance away the waltz of life
Right or wrong
The seed we never sow
That's our loss
Our sacrifice

What does the winter bring
If not yet another spring

15. Epilogue
[Bonus track]

One other year has left my life
One year bygone so soon
These were the days I sacrificed
These days were lived for you

Some came with winter in white
Some days were blown away
Some came with sultry summer nights
Some with October rain

Oh, how I long for utter silence
But who am I to know
When rain will turn to snow?
If life brings another day

1. Providence
[music - Kamelot, lyrics - Pavlicko]

Here - I stand before you all
This body's been beaten and battered
But I will not fall
Time - It may change me
As I look back upon this cold life
I see nothing but misery
Push me: Pull me:
I will not turn away
All this: Pain will:
Prove fruitful one day
You'll see
As I stand I see legions before me
They drink and they dance
In the night
Without thinking I unsheathe my sword
My body is ready to fight
I Walk into the fire
They say that I've sunk so low
But my goal lies much higher
I will, Not lie
Down in the grave
If they, Want me
I am not afraid
Tempting Providence once again
I fall to my knees and my hands
Tempting providence
When will this madness end
You made me the man that I am...
Now
That I am old and wise
The fire has dimmed to a wisp
But I'm still alive
Oh-
The end is much closer
I never thought I'd see the day
When it would be over
Hold me, Tell me today is the day
All this, Pain will soon go away
Tempting Providence once again
I fall to my knees and my hands
When will this nightmare end
Tempting providence once again
This nightmare will soon reach its' end

2. Millennium
[music - Kamelot, lyrics - Khan]

I look into the black horizon
The more I see the more I know
I try to justify the wars won
But that won't satisfy my soul
I hold the future in my hand
But I could easily destroy
I see the footprints in the sand
They seem to vanish in the void
Can I walk away
Can I choose to stay
Feel I'm getting near
Voices that I hear
Sail away, follow the sacred heart
Chase the sun, one with the moon and stars
Sail away, You'll find the promised land
In your hand, there is a New Millennium
I wish wouldn't have to worry
About the life that lies ahead
But when the present turns tomorrow
I shall remember what they said
Feel I'm getting near
Voices that I hear
Sail away, follow the sacred heart
Chase the sun, one with the moon and stars
Sail away, you'll find the promised land
In your hand, there is a New Millennium

3. King's Eyes
[music - Kamelot, lyrics - Youngblood / Barry]

Seize this regal day
Your time has come
Reach for the crown
Take all that you can
Its your time to become the King
Its time to take
All that life has to give to you
Look towards the heavens search you soul
It will tell you the truth that I'm told
Brave men will fight
Weak men will always die
Never to reach the the top of the mountainside
Look through these King's Eyes
What do you see?
Fortune and glory and triumphs to be
Look through these King's Eyes
What do they tell?
Your desire will never be killed
There's a certain feeling you get
At the moment you know you're the one
That sets the course of your own destiny
Controlled by you alone feel it rise
Inside your heart
The winning force at hand reach for the crown
Take all that you can
You can do anything
You can be king
Don't be controlled
Master your own destiny
Brave men will fight
Weak men will always die
Never to reach the the top of the mountainside
Look through these King's Eyes
What do you see?
Fortune and glory and triumphs to be
Look through these King's Eyes
What do they tell?
Your desire will never be killed
Look through these eyes...

4. Expedition
[music - Kamelot, lyrics - Youngblood / Barry]

Freedom fires burning
Mighty kingdoms shall rise
Crystal ships have returned
Like pawns on a distant shore
There's a cold empty place inside
Where you know there's no end
Mighty storm mighty storm
Stirs from the skies above
Like a cold chill rushed upon my face
Searching - for what awaits us
Set a course for a new shore
For what tomorrow will bring
Plunging the northern seas
Winds fill the sails
As we approach another world
That time has forgotten me
The sun blinds and circles me
No man is an island
No footsteps have walked these shores
Discoveries on virgin soil
Let the Expedition begin
Searching - for what awaits us
Set a course for a new shore
For what tomorrow will bring

5. Where I Reign
[music - Kamelot, lyrics - Pavlicko]

Spinning twisting in my hand
I hold the key to this wasteland
I've been searching it for you
Don't try to run
Don't hide away
There is no hope you can't escape
I see your smile fade away
Your bright blue sky has turned to gray
Tonight
Unlock the door
Close your eyes
I'll set you free
Here, in this spiralling darkness
Where my pleasure is your pain
Fear wraps it's arms around you
Here: is where I reign
It feels so good
This feels so right
That you should be my sacrifice
Don't try to run
Don't hide away
There is no hope you can't be saved
Here, in this spiralling darkness
Where my pleasure is your pain
Fear wraps it's arms around you

6. Rhydin
[music - Kamelot, lyrics - Youngblood]

In a time in a place
Long ago today
I can see it there in the distance
In the air on line
On the corner of the mind
Rhydin is rising against the sun
Rhydin is rising
Join us a new world is open
Rhydin is rising
Don't you know its a new kingdom
Its new kingdom
In the sea its a birth
On the corner of this earth
Somewhere in the dark horizon
These are the days
Endless wars
In the fields and on our shores
Where the minute last a day
Rhydin is rising
Join us a new world is open
Rhydin is rising
Don't you know its a new kingdom
Its all there, its all there in your mind

7. Parting Visions
[music - Kamelot, lyrics - Youngblood / Khan]

Remembering that day
I see my body below me
Sighs rend the air
Night will it find the day
Or will I slumber for Eternity
There's a knocking at the gates
The darkness is calling me
How will I know what awaits?
Pulled through these hollowed halls
The light in the distance
As my spirit falls
I must not leave this world
But I lost my resistance
Heaven held before me
I can see The fires are churning
Is this really how it has to be?
Parting Visions in my head
Calling out your name
It screams to be heard
Voices in my head
Parting Visions in my head
Calling out your name
It screams to be heard
Voices in my head

8. Once A Dream
[music - Kamelot, lyrics - Youngblood]

I saw your shadow disappear
Outside my door today
Now I'm left here lost and alone
I light a candle in your name
An eternal burning flame
Shining like the sun to find your way home
Cold tide tower my way
And now I know
Warm skies shower my face
Find your way home
I knew this day would come
But I feared it anyway
Now my castles cold and dark
What was once a dream now becomes our destiny
And I can't wait another day
What was once a dream now means everything
To me.To me.
No country can divide
No seas can separate
Our souls tonight
We are one
What was once a dream now becomes our destiny
And I can't wait another day
What was once a dream now means everything
To me. To me

9. Irea
[music - Kamelot, lyrics - Khan]

I had to climb the highest mountain
I was on my own
And I had to walk through fire and rain
In my search for you
I will search for you
I had to sail the seven seas
Into no mans land
And I found my place in history
Found out who I am
Who am I?
Irea
I close my eyes and call your name
Irea
I pretend you're mine again
I fall into you once again
Chasing memories
And I will live in Cardinal Sin
When you set me free
Wont you set me free?
Irea
I close my eyes and call your name
Irea
I pretend you're mine again
Irea
I need you here
Irea
Once you are gone I go insane

10. Siége
[Instrumental]
11. One Day
[Bonus Track]Can you remember the morning I told you goodbye,
Just when a new was dawning a piece of me died...

somehow I have to try to
getting used to being alone
If I could only hold you once again
I'd never let go

save me a prayer
when day turns to night

lord won't you
show me the light
one day - I'll find back to my heart and soul again
one day - I swear swear by your name

memories keep me awake
and you're there by my side
I wonder if its only in my mind
that I am alive

save me a prayer
when day turns to night
lord won't you
tell me I'm right

one day - I'll find back to my heart and soul again
one day - I swear swear by your name

1. The Great Pandemonium
War, war, war, war, war, war, war...
On a silent shore
I spoke to God
The sun is down
Assemble the great pandemonium
War

One more down by the brook of Babylon
One more down in accordance with my fate
One long drift across the lake of Avalon
One more trip that I must create

And my eyes sweep a shore
that was always there
A blood red line
Through the sonisphere
I can't resolve where it's coming from
I sense it's the great pandemonium

One more, just one more
Just one, just one more day
One more day by the pits of hell
Just one more when even yesterday was too late
One more thought that I had to sell
One last trick that you can't debate

War

On a silent shore
I confronted fear
I spoke to God
But he wasn't there
The sun is down
And the war begun
Assemble the great pandemonium

[Growls:]
Red light
Put the breaks down
Red light
Put the breaks down

And my eyes sweep a shore
That was always there
A blood red line
Through the sonisphere
I can't resolve where it's coming from
I sense it's the great pandemonium

On a silent shore
I confronted fear
I spoke to God
But he wasn't there
The sun is down
And the war begun
Assemble the great pandemonium

Just one, just one, just one more day
Just one, just one, just one more day
Just one, just one more
War

2. If Tomorrow Came
I'm not sure
If she could ease your pain
You've been gone for awhile
Crushed you heart and soul
And teased your bane
Hush your mouth
Here she comes
Watch out

She can see you
Like the hounds of Hell
Smell your fear when you flee
Here she comes
Velvet ocean paradise
The power sorceress
At your fingertips
God made flesh
Perfect Alibi

You saw her walking
Over poison ivy leaves
Nobody knows her name
But something must have
Opened your eyes it seems
Cause nothing is quite the same

I'm not sure about a thing
You know
Days are long in the haze
Here she comes
Velvet ocean paradise
the power sorceress
Get a glimpse of God
Here she comes
With her good advice

You wanted every single moment
You've resigned
Knowing there's none to blame
You might as well
I swear on my life you tried
As if tomorrow came

Searching in the deepest forest
Merging with belief you saw her
All you've seen and all you've known
Tells you that she kept you warm

3. Dear Editor
"Dear Editor,
This is the Zodiac speaking.
I am back with you.
Tell Herb Caen I am here.
I have always been here.
That city pig, Toschi, is good, but I am both smarter and better.
He will get tired then leave me alone.
I am waiting for a good movie about me.
Who will play me?
I am now in control of all things.
Yours truly..."

4. The Zodiac
She was so kind to me
She sang her little shadow song
And I could not resist it
Bitter blood, come sing along

With your hand upon the bible
Would you swear that is the truth?
(The whole truth and the truth alone)

If she had only shut her mouth

Shattered memories of quiet cold rejection
A careful devil's irony in pure perfection
In pure deceit

You ask me
Was it all I had to tell?
Was it all I could recall?

Know that I broke her neck
A twisted china white visage
I may seem unaffected
But don't we all want to be god?

Is it all you can remember?
Would you swear it on your life?

You will never really know my name without reflection
A careful devil's irony in pure perfection
In pure deceit

But in the moment it's so beautiful
Flow along with a hunger
With the nature of the beast

These are shattered memories of quiet cold rejection
A careful devil's irony in pure perfection
You will never really know my name without reflection
A careful devil's irony in pure perfection
In pure deceit

5. Hunter's Season
Someone to protect and be protected by
When that certain fury would come
Someone to respect and be respected by
When deprivation took its toll on you
No more to defend, fading away

'Cause we were always alone,
We were born in the hunter's season
All I really ever wanted was for you
You to die in the arms of someone

Someone to remember only to the ground
When the sudden glory is gone
Mother would you send a sign, a message down
Consolidation with your only son
No more to defend, but someone to love

'Cause we were always alone,
We were born in the hunter's season
All I really ever wanted was for you
You to die in the arms of someone

This destiny falls upon you
'Cause nothing remains, so long
Only a miracle could have killed the pain
You see, now you go

In silent custody, you meet my eyes
Though life is long I know you'll wait for me
Know it too

'Cause we were always alone,
We were born in the hunter's season
All I really ever wanted was for you
You to die in the arms of someone

6. House On A Hill
Call me a liar, a king or a fool
But sing me a song of prosperity
Higher and higher the further we fall
Hard to remember

I will surrender and I'll always wait
Wait as in all of eternity

Hard to remember, and hard to forget
The shadow that hangs over me

Take me home, to a house on a hill, in oblivion
And take away the shadow over me

Cry me a river but once you run dry
Say there's a reason you do

Godless endeavors, smothered and broken
All that I wanted was you.

Take me home, to a house on a hill, in oblivion
Where souls never die all alone
You're longing for love, not for sympathy
So take away the shadow over me

Under the starlight you shine in solitude
Eyes on the ocean and far beyond west of the moon

Take me home, to a house on a hill, in oblivion
Where souls never die all alone
You're longing for love, not for sympathy
Over the hills

Home, to your house on a hill, to oblivion
Where souls never die all alone
You're longing for love, not for sympathy
So take away the shadow over me!

7. Necropolis
Sunshine
Swell life
Soak in another day
All that I need
Is a reason to go
You and I
Could fly away
We'd go up
And never come back down
From Heaven you know

Wake me
Revolve
In my wounds
Lay down your enemy
On the altar of refined deception
Hate me
I'm all over you
Reset the harmony
Like a fire in the night

Pushing closer
East side silence
One last warning
West side
Let all be friends
Every nation
Thank you
For putting down your arms

This was the war
To end all wars
This was the war to save democracy

Wake me
Like nails in my spine
Let's play the tragedy
In the fire of
A last temptation
Hate me for wasting my time
On commonalities
In the name of self-respect

Don't wait too long
Don't harvest too late
May I wish you won't
Believe in your fate

Wake me
Revolve
In my wounds
Lay down your enemy
In the fire of a last temptation 
Hate me for wasting my time
On commonalities
In this city of the dead

8. My Train Of Thoughts
In the shadow of my doubt
This life is dust on naked walls
In the ruins of defeat
The spotlights fade
There's a clown without a crowd
His sorrow smiles relentlessly
Welcome winter bittersweet
Of final fall

My train of thoughts
Keep on hauling me over a low again
Easy to see for a someone
Whose soul can bleed

Who am I to overrule
Believers at the wonder wall
Some illusions come undone
And violently

My train of thoughts
Keep on hauling me over a low again
Easy to see for a someone
Whose soul can bleed

So far astray
When all comes to all
You'll never be satisfied
You might as well let go

9. Seal Of Woven Years
Pull the trigger now
If you're craving a hero
Or say life after death
Was it you or was it me
Who had to fake
Implementation
Of a lonely heart
So warm and oh so weak

My fractured eyes
In the mold below
The fattest lies
Hold your needs

Wait for the morning
Come a different day
Carry the weight of all
You say is wrong
We would both deny
There is a secret fate
A seal of woven years
Of waiting flying by

Rush my head
Into your wall of complaints
And crush me softly
Like you crushed yourself asunder
You better leave me be

Now go
My soul was sold
For a rainy day
But it's not too late
For a full retreat
 
Wait for the morning
Come a different day
Carry the weight of all
You say is wrong
We would both deny
There is a secret fate
A seal of woven years
Of waiting flying by
 

10. Poetry For The Poisoned - Incubus
There was a time when I was young
A boy with bold ambitions
There was a time when I could tell the crooked from the wicked one

There was a song that someone sung
A hint of recognition
There was a time I knew you well enough to know you won't be gone

[Chorus:] Come with me tonight

Tell me how it feels to be alive

There was a time I had respect
A name of reputation
There was a time when I could watch myself without being disgraced

[Chorus:] Come with me tonight

Let us find a place where we can hide

[Chorus:] Come into the light

Let me show you how we stay alive

[Instrumental]

[Spoken:]
The word "incubus" means "to lie on", and it was believed that any feeling in bed, such as a weight pressing down on your chest, especially accompanied by nightmares, was a sure sign that an incubus had attempted to have a nocturnal intercourse with you.
Given the religious fervour of the Middle Ages, it is not altogether surprising that the idea of a demon lover was believed to account of this phenomenon.

11. Poetry For The Poisoned Pt. 2 - So Long
A minute more
'Til the light of day is seen
Lay down
I know you must be nearly there
A bloody kiss
And the vision of a dream
For the last of your days in the sun

In the white light I am calm
Yet peculiarly cold
Silent slumber
And wide awake
Lord have mercy on my soul

So long
Your sorrow be gone
(Show me how it feels to be alive)
No more denial
So long
(Let us find a place where we can hide)

You fed me long
And by God you fed me well
Sleep tight
This day belongs to you my dear
And I am bound
Like a beast onto its prey
We are one of a kind you and I

Pale moon wander
I'm wide awake
Lord have mercy on my soul

So long
Your sorrow be gone
(Show me how it feels to be alive)
No more denial
So long
(Show me all the splendors of the night)

So long
The little last of your attention
Sorrow
This flood to wash your mind
See me
The God of your imagination
Feel me
Come with me tonight

So long
Your sorrow be gone
Show me how it feels to be alive
No more denial
So long

12. Poetry For The Poisoned Pt. 3 - All Is Over
I am the hole in your broken heart
I am the reason we all depart
What if all is over

13. Poetry For The Poisoned Pt. 4 - Dissection
Life in slow review
I see it with my eye
Deeper down and further back
The storm reveals a hidden track
The sun is coming through

Down by a lake
As a child
Without a fear
When a mother's warm embrace
Made a haven in the maze
Those were the moments
And these were my days

14. Once Upon A Time
I am scorn in this heavenly scheme
With a stench of destruction
I'm a reaper of beautiful dreams
And she knows
I'm on the edge
Sacrilege

Push me over

Tell me once upon a time
I close my eyes
And see myself reborn
Righting the wrong
I won't stay to stand in line
Or wait for God to shine all over me
I wait for the storm

I am you
And know that you heard
You and I are the last
At the end of the world
Then we talk
And we run
And we hide
Then so what
The human race
Suffocates

Leave me breathless

Tell me once upon a time
I close my eyes
And see myself reborn
Righting the wrong
I won't stay to stand in line
Or wait for God to shine all over me
I wait for the storm

Move along
Through the ashes of a dream
Move along
And see myself anew again

1. Manus Dei
Give me a sign
Sing the words of innocence and broken pride
Make my conclusions fail
Send me a sign
Heal this broken melody
'Cause each day
A dying Hell

2. Sacrimony (Angel Of Afterlife)
A passing life each day, a carving on the wall
It's like a night without awakening
The truth is lost and maybe never to be found
Like the shadows of my pantomime

When all the world is gathered for the final feast
Will there be someone to believe in me?
Voices echoing in my distorted mind
Is this for real or just a dream?
(Am I losing my mind? I am not afraid, my dear)

[Chorus:]
Sing for me angel of afterlife calming me down
Chaos inside my nebula
And make the wrong turn to right in a celestial light
Forgive my sacrimony

Tell me what they say that I'm supposed to know
Tell me every little detail
Make truth appear for me as distant memories
Like pictures on a silver screen

It all becomes clear
The truth will appear
Forever I'm there for you and sing.

[Chorus]

And now leave me alone
Erase my memory
Don't want to hear, don't want to see
Don't want to think about the lie that follows me

All becomes clear
But no one will hear my testimony 

I am your angel of afterlife calming you down
Silence inside your nebula
And when the wrong turns to right in a celestial light
I'll heed your testimony

[Chorus]

(Ring around a rosie,
A pocketful of posies,
Ashes, ashes
We all fall down)

3. Ashes To Ashes
Ravished from our paradise
A crack in the mirror
I know who's to blame
So full of life but paralyzed
Etched on my iris
But I try not to think of it all...

We swore to god in veritas
And burned our skin like it burned our souls
One dealt with grief by causing pain
She hid behind maple and built her own fortress of sound

Hear this melody almost forgotten

Hush
I've been waiting a lifetime to show you
You're returning to heaven
Like dust to dust
I've been waiting forever to witness your fading
Like ashes to ashes.

Forbidden dance on fragile skin
Why do you shine as I suffer in pain?
The greatest scars remain within
Leaving you now with a heart black as cardinal sin.

Fear this melody almost forgotten

Hush
I've been waiting a lifetime to show you
You're returning to heaven
Like dust to dust
I've been waiting forever to witness your fading
Like ashes to ashes!

Hate... My solution...
Fate... An illusion.

[Chorus x2]

4. Torn
Like a pendant on the neck of a queen
Ten thousand scars, an embrace of the stone
As we dance on a steady canopy
Accuse me, fool me, take all my pain away
My friend singing my final song of honor
Betrayed but still I never came around to open my mind

[Chorus:]
I was torn by the storms in my head
Like a victim of fate
Born to regret
Still denied by the spirits of hell
A call to repent
'Til the visions still stand in silence like a shadow

Like a martyr that is nowhere to be seen
Ten thousand stars I've prayed for (have prayed for the calm)
As we drift on this neverending sea
Clear me, keep me, take all my pain away, my friend
Singing my final song of glory
Betrayed but still I finally came around and opened my eyes

[Chorus:]
I was torn by the storms in my head
Like a victim of fate
Born to regret
Still denied by the spirits of hell
A call to repent
'Til the visions still stand in silence like a shadow
Like a shadow

[Solo]

Torn by the thorns in my head
Like a victim of violence
A call to repent
Denied by the spirits of heaven
Take me up again to the music of dawn

[Chorus:]
I was torn by the storms in my head
Like a victim of fate
Born to regret
Still denied by the spirits of hell
A call to repent
'Til the visions still stand like a shadow

5. Song For Jolee
There's a shadow in the cold white light of day
I hope that someday you'll forgive and set me free

While standing in the pale white light, Jolee is lost
I wrote a letter to the angels to follow me into the light again.

Underneath the velvet letters of my heart
Always will remind me that I'm hurt and sad

[Chorus:]
I'm sorry but I can't stop the bleeding
Crying and it's all because of you.
One look in the mirror to see
What's real and fake, Jolee.

There's a princess captured in a wooden frame.
I'd trade eternity for one last look at you.

Not playing by the rules
We played the game of loss.
I'll keep on writing to the angels so you're safe 'til the moment we meet again.

Underneath the make-up the scars that sear my heart,
Unspeakable reminder that I'm hurt and sad

[Chorus]
I'm sorry but I can't stop the bleeding
Crying and it's all because of you.
One look in the mirror to see,
What's real and fake, Jolee.

I'm sorry but I can't stop the bleeding
Crying and it's all because of you.
One look in the mirror to see,  what's real and fake,
 
Jolee.

Oh.
One look in the mirror to see, what's real and fake, Jolee.

6. Veritas
In the mirror my reflection lies to me
That is not the man I want to see
But every harvest takes me closer to my aim
I will be there as soon as darkness falls
My life is but a heartbeat away
And all you've ever had will soon belong to me

[Chorus:]
(In morte ultima veritas)
You will kneel before me
And you will confess that I'm god
(Vincit veritas in omni re)
Send me your prayers
But death is the answer to life

While you're weeping, feed my anger I stay calm
'Cause I'm sure that you won't let me down
Fading gently to the sound I can't forget
And don't you know that when the music dies
My life is but a heartbeat away
And all you've ever had will soon belong to me

[Chorus]

(So short but innocent
It always will remain
And all I know is
It was good
My childhood memories
And I was blessed to live)

(Please, please let it die
Or brother this is my last goodbye
I'm begging you)

[Chorus]

7. My Confession
Give me a sign
Sing the words of innocence
And broken pride
Make my conclusions fail

Send me a sign
Hear this broken melody
'Cause each night i die
In hell

[CHORUS:]
My god has shown his sympathy
For all the spirits lost
I'll pray for salvation
And peace for ages
Standing in the summer breeze
Inhaling life again
A new day has come
A chance to relive
Forget and forgive

Somehow I wasted all
They sealed my voice and wisdom
But my soul was born
On the battleground

Justice and blood
Long awaited fix of me
And tonight you die
In hell

[CHORUS]

I bind my eyes
Inside my mind
We're bound together
This is my confession
So may your enemy
Alone in my religion
Release my heart
Unfold my tongue

Save a place for me in heaven
We'll meet another day
I found forgiveness
And the meaning of it all
My fear is gone
Gone

[CHORUS]

Forget and forgive

8. Silverthorn
Curse or repayment?
Truth or illusion?
In my noble asylum
When dark hours linger
The sinister silence
Is bowed into millions of tears

The sweetness of sound
Turns to raging thunder
A deadly serenade

In the moonlight, the bringer of pain
Like fear on a silver plate
I am frozen, betrayed by myself
When will this end?

Same old pavilion
A different appearance
Is playing messiah
All good was taken
A thorn made of silver
Abandoned my will to go on

The sweetness of sound
Turns to raging thunder
A deadly serenade

In the moonlight, the bringer of pain
Like fear on a silver plate
I am frozen, betrayed by myself
When will this end?

Life is a flower, fading away
We are not destined to stay
Love is forever, the spirit is free
Time is a borrowed gift for you and me

The sweetness of sound
Turns to raging thunder

A deadly serenade

In the moonlight, the bringer of pain
Like fear on a silver plate
I am frozen, betrayed by myself
A deadly serenade

In the moonlight, the bringer of pain
Like fear on a silver plate
I am frozen, betrayed by myself
Everything comes to an end

9. Falling Like The Fahrenheit
Let me play a melody for you
While searching for the light
And a way to live forever

Your flaws make sure you never contemplate
And see the consequence
Of trying to survive

[BRIDGE:]
Like the shadows in my head
You will play that ghost again
(Do you think salvation waits for you?)
As I lay you down to sleep
All your tears are mine to keep

[CHORUS:]
Falling like the Fahrenheit
Someone will always lose
You will never see another sunrise
My cyanide in paradise
That someone's always there
And I will never see another sundown in your eyes

Let me share a memory with you
Imprisoned in the sound
Let us dream away together
Every single note is bound to send
A flower from this world to whither with a smile

[BRIDGE]

[CHORUS]

Give me a sign
To take what is righteously mine

Give me the secrets that you keep
I'll save them for no one else to see

[CHORUS]

10. Solitaire
On a dim December morning
A glass of "I forgot the name"
I can't turn wine to water
I won't come back again

And the minutes turn to hours
I keep spinning cards that look the same
And I so await the moment...
To talk to you

Please shine oh night my dear, embrace me

It's time again,
All light is banned
My soul is free
And blessed to see

[CHORUS:]
Sometimes when I'm out of reach
And sometimes when I'm there
That is when our souls agree and join in solitaire
Sometimes when my will to love has gone away
That is when I hear your name

Now the pale sunlight is blinding
It's here to claim my sanity
And I just can't stand the waiting...
To revive ecstasy

Please shine oh night my dear, embrace me

It's time again
All light is banned
My soul is free
And blessed to see

[CHORUS]

I won't sustain another day
My love, my darkness
Daylight reflects my starving soul
And open wounds for everyone to see

[CHORUS 2x]

I want to hear your name
Hear your name

11. Prodigal Son
[Part I: Funerale]

Essence of beauty
Taken to soon
Princess of hope
Deep in our hearts you live on

Essence of goodness
Goddess of light
Give us the power
God gave us strength to live on

Essence of beauty
Taken too soon
Princess of hope
Deep in our hearts you live on

Essence of goodness
Goddess of light
Give us the power
God gave us strength
Give us the strength to live on

[Part II: Burden of Guilt]

(How could this happen
What have we done)

How could this happen?
Oh, what have we done?
Will our tears ever pay for our sin?
Mother forgive us
We need all your love
To fight and to carry the burden of shame

Hereby we swear that for as long as we live
We will not soil our name
The truth made of iron
Will see it with pain until death
Our secret remains
Until death our love remains
And in death our love re-framed

I need a way
But worlds unwind
Lovers in blood
Now divided in heart

[Part III: The Journey]

My grief and sorrow always trying
To repay
Behind the palisade
This is destined life
Music and the tears I hear you say
Through the walls
Turns to nightmares and there's no escape at all

Oh joyful childhood
You died so young

Every child follows blind
On the journey we call life
Learn it every day
Given love or given name
Determines everybody's fate in life
Be careful what you give

Stranger to love and affection
On the run
In search of shelter in the solitude of sin
A drifter in the dark
A soldier of the pain
A constant slave under the belt of misery

Oh joyful childhood
You died so young

Every child follows blind
On the journey we call life
Learn it every day
Given love or given name
Determines everybody's fate in life
Be careful what you give

12. Continuum
[Instrumental]
13. Grace
[Limited Box Edition Bonus Track]Watch me passing through
Your odd dimension
You’re standing there
Carrying the cross that I gave

I’m a northern light
The stars above you
I whisper your name
Oh, feeling strange

You’re falling down from grace
And feeling kinda strange
It’s not over
You’re falling down from grace
And feeling kinda strange
It’s not over

Come and breathe inside
My celestial sphere
Feel the rush in your fragile flesh

I can feel your anxiety
Restless mind
Searching for love to embrace

You’re falling down from grace
And feeling kinda strange
It’s not over
You’re falling down from grace
And feeling kinda strange
It’s not over

Don’t despise me
I am the truth
Don’t be indifferent
You won’t be condemned
Will I ever reach you
If I open my arms
You lose, you die
Turning my heart into stone

You’re falling down from grace
You’re feeling kinda strange
It’s not over
You’re falling down from grace
And feeling kinda strange
It’s not over

14. Leaving Too Soon
[Japanese/Korean Bonus Track]Close your eyes and count to ten
I dare you
I will catch your fall
It takes a dreamer to believe

Make a wish and take a stand
I promise the world to you
The sun will paint your face with gold

Saying you don't have to live afraid

Because we're all leaving too soon
In a moment of sobriety we learn to see
We are not meant to stay for eternity
Don't use the time you have to dream away

Weigh the future in your hand
Tomorrow, today has gone to sleep
Only to wake up yesterday

Cross the borders of your land
The soil beneath will crumble
The sun will light the fire in your eyes again

Saying you don't have to die afraid

Because we're all leaving too soon
In a moment of sobriety we learn to see
We are not meant to stay for eternity
Don't use the time you have to dream away

Because we're all leaving too soon
In a moment of sobriety we learn
We are not meant to stay for eternity
So use the life you have to live your dream

1. Fallen Star
You are my reason to stay
Even if daylight’s a lifetime away
May the kings and the queens of the dawn
Remember my name
As dark as the fallen star
My song for the children unforgiven

Sometimes the weight of the world’s
Coming over me
A feeling I can’t forget
Sometimes I find myself caught in a storm
And my future’s a nightmare away
When I’m dreaming

Sometimes I fear
I am losing your sympathies
A liar demands respect
Sometimes I fell I am losing control
And feed on the absence of love

Walking this world like animals
And into the light we’re fading

You are my reason to stay
Even if daylight’s a lifetime away
May the kings and the queens of the dawn
Remember my name
As dark as the fallen star
My song for the children unforgiven

Sometimes I’m lost in the silence of empathy
A moment I can’t reflect
Sometimes I feel like I’m loosing control
And feed on the essence of hate

Walking this world like animals
And into the dark we’re wading

You are my reason to stay
Even if daylight’s a lifetime away
May the kings and the queens of the dawn
Remember my name
As dark as the fallen star
My song for the children unforgiven

Somewhere in time
A story seldom told
Somewhere in history
Our destiny behold…

In the dead of the night I’m just a corpse
Awoken the enemy sleeping inside
In the eye of the storm we’re just the same

'cause you are my reason to stay
Even if daylight’s a lifetime away
May the kings and the queens of the dawn
Remember my name
As dark as the fallen star
My song for the children unforgiven
My song for the lost
My song for the children unforgiven

2. Insomnia
When the darkness brings the cold
To draw me under
I am caught between
The chapters of a dream
Something is reaching out and
My entire world is crumbling
And it whispers that I am
The chosen one…
Can you hear me…?

When the night begins to fall
I watch the shadows growing tall
Feeding my insomnia
Like a fly on the wall

I’m asleep but wide awake
A nightmare on repeat
In the haze I sense
The purpose of my soul
We are all born to leave a
Scar deep in the hearts of many
But can I really trust that I’m
The chosen one
Can you hear me…?

When the night begins to fall
I watch the shadows growing tall
Feeding my insomnia
Like a fly on the wall
When the night begins to fall
I hear a thousand voices call
Chasing my insanity
Like a fly on the wall

My wide eyed confidence
Still echoes in mind
A bright white prophecy
Protector of the light

When the night begins to fall
I watch the shadows growing tall
Feeding my insomnia
Like a fly on the wall
When the night begins to fall
I hear a thousand voices call
Chasing my insanity
Like a fly on the wall

3. Citizen Zero
I wait to surface
Above these bellowed growls
To sweep the shallows of utopia
I am the anchor
And the rope around your feet
In a river deep I hold you down

I’ve come to stage your abdication
I’m the creation of your sins
Embrace me

When the hounds are out
Feeding me a lie
When the hounds are out
My sickness is released
When the cards are down
For all the world to see
When the cards are down
And the strings are cut
These mannequins will sleep

In the center
Of your greed infected wounds
I am a thorn of endless sorrow
Just one of thousands
In your self selected crown
A king to wallow in the mire
And roll in defeat…

I will protect the incubation
I am your bottomless decease
Embrace me

When the hounds are out
Feeding me a lie
When the hounds are out
My sickness is released
When the cards are down
For all the world to see
When the cards are down
And the strings are cut
These mannequins will sleep

Pater noster
Invidia
Ira gula
Superbia acedia
Luxuria
Avaritia
Pater parce meis peccatis

All I see
Is mine to take
To have and to hold…
To suffocate
All I want
Is mine to keep
And I want it all
So father forgive me…

When the hounds are out
Feeding me a lie
When the hounds are out
My sickness is released
When the cards are down
For all the world to see
When the cards are down
And the strings are cut
These mannequins will sleep

4. Veil Of Elysium
Hear my promise of blistering light
Sowing a rose of obsidian
My dear I promise
Death comes to all
In a heartbeat only silence
Let's play with the fire that runs in our veins
Trust in the might of a miracle
Now winter has come and I'll stand in the snow
I don't feel the cold
And it's all that I will ever need to believe

One day I know we will meet again
In the shade of a life to die for
Watching the world through the eyes of a child in Elysium
Will I know you then?
(Will I know you then?)

Now bring down your fortress and swallow your pride
Don't break in your moments of ignorance
Existence will capture a spark of life
Just a fragment, but it's all that I will ever need to revive

One day I know we will meet again
In the shade of a life to die for
Watching the world through the eyes of a child in Elysium
Will I find you there in that darkness
Of the shadow that comes over all?
Dear friend will I know you then?
Will I know you then at all?

One day we'll meet
(One day we will meet in the shade of a life)
In the shade of a life to die for
(Watching the world)
Watching the world through the eyes of a child
Will I know you then?

One day I know we will meet again
In the shade of a life to die for
Watching the world through the eyes of a child in Elysium
Will I know you then?
Will I know you then?

5. Under Grey Skies
In the ruins of madness
A ghost of a chance
There is new hope reborn in every tragedy
And the world I see bares
A mystery waiting to be revealed

And don’t you know that
Every cloud has a silver lining

You may call me a dreamer
Call me a fool
Just a blue eyed believer in you

In the age of confusion
Tears and despair
Let me sell you a dream of prosperity
In this great illusion
Our humble intentions are well concealed

'Cause don’t you know that
Every cloud has a silver lining

You may call me a dreamer
Call me a fool
Just a blue eyed believer in you
But I’ll die for that someone
In the blink of an eye
So tell me… please tell me
Just what kind of fool am I...

When I drown in my fears
In the darkness of sorrow
There’s a promise of grace
Under silver grey skies
And I’m drying my tears
In the blaze of the sunlight
A reviere sealed with a kiss

You may call me a dreamer
Call me a fool
Just a blue eyed believer in you
But I’ll die for that someone
In the blink of an eye
So tell me… please tell me
Just what kind of fool am I...

You may call me a dreamer
Call me a fool
Just a blue eyed believer in you
But I’ll die for that someone
In the blink of an eye
So tell me… please tell me
Just what kind of fool am I…
What kind of fool am I….?

6. My Therapy
When the bliss of salvation has come
I don’t mind silence and my fear is gone
It’s the chemical way to serenity
It’s faith versus science

Who fears the ticking of the clock
When centuries are passing in seconds
Black is the color of my past
A product of society’s abuse

Come and take me off my daily dose of pain
Take me off and shelter me
From this static nothing
You’re the antidote
For solitude injected in my veins
May the touch of your hand
forever be my therapy

I need your voice to fill the void
A lullaby to sooth my rejection
Pure disinfection of the heart
Before this silence tears my soul apart

Come and take me off my daily dose of pain
Take me off and shelter me
From this static nothing
You’re the antidote
For solitude injected in my veins
May the touch of your hand
forever be my therapy

I walk alone
On the path of self-extinction
With all these chains to pull me down
Come at night
Luminate my inner chambers
And leave the light on when you go
Please don’t go…

Come and take me off my daily dose of pain
Take me off and shelter me
From this static nothing
You’re the antidote
For solitude injected in my veins
May the touch of your hand
forever be my therapy

Come and take me off my daily dose of pain
Take me off and shelter me
From this static nothing
You’re the antidote
For solitude injected in my veins
May the touch of your hand
forever be my therapy

7. Ecclesia
[Instrumental]
8. End Of Innocence
Tell me do you remember
The games and the laughter
Far from the choices we’d have to make
A kiss on the lips
Turned the toad to a prince
And the end was a lifetime away

I pour myself onto this page
I am writing a swan song for ages
I will leave it behind
And just maybe you will
Remember me…

It’s the end of an innocent era
The beauty we know will be lost
We are building a bridge
Between heaven and hell
To return again
And why must a hero die young
Not to be gone and forgotten
So I pray for the broken
This is not the end of innocence

Now it’s me and my knife
And the will is my temple
Numb from the choices I have to make
Slowly we all took a bite of the apple
And laughter’s a lifetime away
Remember me…

I pour myself onto this page
I am writing a swan song for ages
I will leave it behind
And just maybe you will
Remember me…

It’s the end of an innocent era
The beauty we know will be lost
We are building a bridge
Between heaven and hell
To return again
And why must a hero die young
Not to be gone and forgotten
So I pray for the broken
This is not the end of innocence

Of innocence…
Where do we go from here…?

It’s the end of an innocent era
The beauty we know will be lost
We are building a bridge
Between heaven and hell
To return again
And why must a hero die young
Not to be gone and forgotten
So I pray for the broken
This is not the end of innocence

9. Beautiful Apocalypse
Gravity is pulling me
And I don’t really wanna be
A child of desolation anymore
My inner world is quaking
So tired of my trivial self
A paradise corrupted to the core
Standing on the edge…
 
Something old and
Something new
Something borrowed
Something blue
It’s time for us to celebrate
Our beautiful apocalypse
 
Always know that you are not alone…
Take my hand
My gutter child adventure
I’ll take you where the lovers go to sleep
My borderline affection
Now close your eyes, don’t be afraid
You’re not alone…
 
Tumbling in the multitude
On our way to new horizons
Drowning in a mass of refugees
Liberation in demise
Revolution in disguise
Failing to survive these battlefields
We’re standing on the edge

Something old and
Something new
Something borrowed
Something blue
It’s time for us to celebrate
Our beautiful apocalypse
 
Always know that you are not alone…
Take my hand
My gutter child adventure
I’ll take you where the lovers go to sleep
My borderline affection
Now close your eyes, don’t be afraid
You’re not alone…

You are not alone…
My gutter child adventure
You are not alone
I’ll take you where the lovers go to sleep
My borderline affection
Cause you are not alone
 
Take my hand
My gutter child adventure
I’ll take you to a place where lovers leap
Now close your eyes, don’t be afraid
You’re not alone…

10. Liar Liar (Wasteland Monarchy)
Would you pray if I said you were dying
Would you be a little stronger
Or fall down on your knees
Would you stay with me
If you knew that I was lying
Would you walk away
Or turn the other cheek

I tremble where I stand
My wish is your command
The nature of a truly desperate heart
Give me something real
That I can truly feel
Liar liar on the wall

Whisper whisper in the dark
Tell me what you see
Poisoned by your fly infested poetry
Liar liar on the wall
Give the world to me
A wasteland or a monarchy
Liar liar
Tell me what you see…

Now I’m here and my pain is my companion
Now I know it wasn’t meant to heal… the cut
Is way too deep
No more wasted years of sacrificial bleeding
I’m the master of the war inside me

But still… I tremble where I stand
My wish is your command
The yearning of an undiscovered soul
Give me something real
So that I can truly feel
Liar liar on the wall

Whisper whisper in the dark
Tell me what you see
Poisoned by your fly infested poetry
Liar liar on the wall
Give the world to me
A wasteland or a Monarchy
Liar liar…
Tell me what you see…

I shine when the sun is down
And carry this heavy crown
I won’t compromise
Release me
What we’re looking for
Liar liar on the wall

Mirror mirror in the dark
Tell us what we are looking for
Make us see the truth
Liar liar on the wall

Whisper whisper in the dark
Tell me what you see
Poisoned by your fly infested poetry
Liar liar on the wall
Give the world to me
A wasteland or a monarchy
Liar liar…
Tell me what you see…

11. Here's To The Fall
I am your god
Tell me what’s on your mind
My demons are haunting me
Eating me alive
I fear the unknown
The darkness before me
Will we ever start anew
Wait and you will see…
 
Here’s to the fall
The fall of us all
Are we nothing but leaves in the wind?
Here’s to the fall
Here’s to the darkness to come for us all
Turning day into night
 
When I’m weak in my faith
Will you still believe in me?
My cynical imagery
Feeds my disbelief
And when I’m lost in the dark
Will you still save me?
God why won’t you answer me…
What is left to see?
 
Here’s to the fall
The fall of us all
Are we nothing but leaves in the wind?
Here’s to the fall
Here’s to the darkness to come for us all
Turning day into night
 
Help me to see
Through your masquerade like
Perfect disguise
Open my eyes
Help me to see
Here’s to the coming fall…
 
Here’s to the fall
The fall of us all
Are we nothing but leaves in the wind?
Here’s to the fall
Here’s to the darkness to come for us all
Turning day into night
May our souls survive…

12. Revolution
I stand before you blood of mine
A simple man of simple words
I expect no songs of praise when I am dead
Let my lament of endless gray
Light a fire in your hands
To forge a future we can call our own

So rise to the sound of revolution

Revolution
Elevation to a higher ground
Revolution
The last solution for our kind

I speak to you
The chosen ones
With all our strength we stand aligned
The pending birth of war will break the silence
A second chance will wait for us
To redeem us from our craving
And the thirst for what was once forbidden

We are breaking the walls from inside
So rise to the sound of revolution

Revolution
Elevation to a higher ground
Revolution
The last solution for our kind

Citizen zero…
Are you ready for the war…
Crows… cluster… riot!
Burn… the cage… down… riot!

Stand in the ashes
The echoes of our past
The smoke has cleared
There are shards of broken mirrors
Everywhere
We are standing at the crossroads
Afraid but not alone
A thousand missing faces
A story of a rose
In honor of their sacrifice
A new life can be born
I’m grateful and I leave this world
With no regrets at all
As life is pouring out of me
With all the power left in me
I raise my voice…

Revolution
Elevation to a higher ground
Revolution
Retribution
In the sound
Revolution for the human mind
Revolution
The last solution for our kind

13. Haven
[Instrumental]
14. The Ties That Bind
[Japanese Bonus Track]Resurrection in a life beyond the black
I am not afraid
I know what I must do
Preparation for the harvest of my deeds
There is no looking back
Salvation isn’t free

Before my eyes a world benign
I stand to protect what is mine

Word by word and line by line
I follow your voice through the fire
And nothing will disarm my mind
To cut the ties that bind

Jurisdiction to enforce the only truth
And when I say your name
Forgiveness is for me…

Appear before my feverish eyes
I trust you to lead when I’m blind

Word by word and line by line
I follow your voice through the fire
And nothing will disarm my mind
To cut the ties that bind

I have sold my soul
Hesitation’s for the weak
I’m your faithful tool
Dispose of me as you wish
I say your name again and put my blame aside
And I tell myself the end
Will justify my selfish means…

Word by word and line by line
I follow your voice through the fire
And nothing will disarm my mind
To cut the ties that bind
Cause no one can disarm my mind
To cut the ties that bind

15. At First Light
[Vinyl Bonus Track]Breathe...
Help me breathe
I'm shoulder deep in water

Use...
Use me like you want
'Cause I just wanna feel

Another drop
As time goes by
I wait for you

If we lose this moment
How will we ever know
If someone can define our pain?
If we stay in silence
And wait another night
This chance will be forever lost
At first light

If we only had a minute more
Would you waste it here beside me
Or keep it to yourself?

I throw myself down at your feet
And every day I die a little more
For I just wanna feel!

Another drop
As time goes by
I wait for you

If we lose this moment
How will we ever know
If someone can define our pain?
If we stay in silence
And wait another night
This chance will be forever lost
At first light

1. Save Me
Ready to sin for the pride of my king
ready to leave for his love
What a stranger world, where a kingdom may fall
for a "caprice" of a lord
In my hall there's a reek of sin that flows
lost in the darkness i can feel your presence
my shame won't be cleansed anymore

Save me, oh my God
'cause i've got to sell my soul
won't you save me once again?
Won't you hear my silent pray?

Slave to a portrait, the king fell in love
"bring me that girl", his final word
Should ever a poor man, as i really am
live by his faith, or obedience

[Magnani C., Cantarelli A.]

2. Out Of Memory
Come to the city where madness takes over
come to the land where the nightmare comes true

Open your mind to a fantasy-travel
where no more rules dominate out this world

I know and i remember the silences
I've seen and i don't relate of death

All i've seen and all i wanted
i wasted my time, now i flow with the sand

I've never begun, i haven't finished, yet ...
I am a step out of memory

[Magnani C.]

3. In The Shade
Livin' in a wasteland
without any shadows
what's left for me to see?
I wonder with my soul
Your Angel-eyes are shining bright
I wanna take your hand
All I know is I can't live with you

In the shade, I will remember
In the shade, I will remember

Fear lives inside your mind
(but) my dream is still alive
and I'm never looking back
I'm dreaming peace and love

Find you lost in any place
I'm miles away
I'll be searching high and low

In the shade, I will remember
In the shade, I will remember

In the shade, I will remember
In the shade, I will remember

[Music: Mangnani, Tordiglione, Cantini]
[Lyrics: Tordiglione]

4. Falling Rain
Deep in my heart i would like find
A place for love ...
It's not so easy as i'd like ...

And all this time, all this time we lost
just to follow a dream ...
Nothing will remain ...

The rain is falling down onto me
falling down as a silent cry

Now i'm staring at the mirror and
inside my heart
i can find my inner soul ...
now i'm staring at the mirror and
inside my eyes
nothing but a little tear ...

It's not our way and i think
you gotta find one
(a little angel starts to cry

This falling rain is telling now
a love is dying
but it will live into your heart

The rain is falling down to me
falling down as a silent cry
Now i'm staring at the mirror and
inside my heart
i can find my inner soul ...
now i'm staring at the mirror and
inside my eyes
nothing but a little tear ...

Deep in my heart i would like find
A place for love ...
and all this time
all the time we lost
just to follow a dream ...

Now i'm staring at the mirror and
inside my heart
I can find my inner soul ...
now i'm staring at the mirror and
inside my eyes
nothing but a little tear ...

Now i'm staring at the mirror and
inside my heart
I can find my inner soul ...
now i'm staring in the mirror and
all around
nothing but falling rain ...

[Magnani C., Cantarelli A., Tiranti R.]

LABYRINTH LYRICS


1. Midnight Resistance
Staying behind the stars
I look at the world and I listen to reason...
I hear an innocent voice, it whisper me a new law
whispers me the way
and I'm sleeping with my dreams

And other crimes and violation
political mistake
everything went according to plan
I made the mistake to trust in them

Ride the sky one more time
ride the sky tonight

Look another way
when moonlight takes the sky
I see the shadows of nighttime
spinning around me...
A mirage in the night
It's a magic for my heart
a drop stolen from the Sea of Eternity

And other crimes and violation
political mistake
everything went according to plan
I made the mistake to trust in them

Ride the sky one more time
ride the sky tonight

I feel a new sensation when I close my eyes
I'm dancing with the clouds
I feel a new temptation run away with my mind
chasing drops of moonlight...

I feel a new sensation when I close my eyes
I'm dancing with the clouds
I feel a new temptation run away with my mind
chasing drops of moonlight...

2. Rad Zone
I've walked in the street of yesterday
I've talked with your eyes as blue the sky

And we learned the hard way
we wanted to live forever
every way together

walking to red zone to the silence of night
I've looked at the city of yesterday

And we've paid with our lives
we'd wanted to live forever
every way together

I've broken everything I've made...
...we've wanted to live forever
every way together...

3. I'm On Fire
Electric madness take the night
frontal collision with your mind
a psycho incident you smell insane
her sweet corruption your adrenalin.

Breaking an entering...silence your enemy
I'm on fire...
...I will show now mercy...
I'm on fire...
Breaking an entering...silence your enemy

4. Out Of Memory
A wasteland tells the history
mental travels of memory
eternal dark for my eyes
eternal silence for my hearing.

Moonlight is all I need
Fading into my dreams
walking through the land of time
(with) memories by my side...

5. Virtual Vortex

6. Gates Of Madness
In my life, in my soul
In my memory I live my dream

(you) take my life, take my soul
take my memory, we lost an year.

This confusion is my agony
My life is lonely but I'm born to need no one

Oh my god you know I'm out of my head
...my heart is sad

Living in dreams trough your eyes
...I drop to the sky
...What's up in my mind?

Imagination makes dreams reality
I walk with my shadow
searching for the truth
I live and learn by my mistakes

LABYRINTH LYRICS


1. Mortal Sin
Eleven masters, eleven lights
eleven fires burning bright
A fall of tears flows the night
She takes my hands and closes her eyes

Refuse to be the God they want
refuse to leave the girl I love
The cheeky deed defied their pride
no mercy inside their eyes

They will remember the time
When i did the mortal sin
Can't I love a mortal woman?
And never the gods in the sky
will forgive my mortal sin
Wasted with a mortal woman

A goldian flash divides my hands
a sudden night and now she's lost
Lost in time in the land of dreams
Wasted wall (of) celestial maze

The Guardian Angel is calling now
gates of pain unclose for me
Lost in maze i'll look for her
She'll guide me along to find the way

They will remember the time
When i did the mortal sin
Can't I love a mortal woman?
And never the gods in the sky
will forgive my mortal sin
Wasted with a mortal woman

We shall remember the time
When we did the mortal sin
Can't I love a mortal woman?
And never the gods in the sky
will forgive my mortal sin
Wasted with a mortal woman

[Music: Tordiglione, Magnani, Rubulotta]
[Lyrics: Tordiglione, Magnani]

2. Midnight Resistance
Staying behind the stars
I look at the world and I listen to reason ...
I hear an innocent voice, it whispers me
a new law
it whispers me the way
and i'm sleeping with my dreams

Unholy love's my violation
a theological mistake
Everything went according to plan
you made the mistake to trust in me

Ride the sky one more time
ride the sky tonight

Look another way
Where moonlight takes the sky
I see the shadows of nighttime
spinning around me ...
A mirage in the night
It's a magic for my heart
a drop stolen from in the sea of Eternity

Unholy love's my violation
a theological mistake
Everything went according to plan
you made the mistake to trust in me

Ride the sky one more time
ride the sky tonight

I feel a new sensation when I close my eyes
I'm dancing with the clouds
I feel a new temptation run away with my mind
chasing drops of moonlight ...

Unholy love's my violation
a theological mistake
Everything went according to plan
you made the mistake to trust in me

[Music: Mangnani, Tordiglione, Rubulotta]
[Lyrics: Tordiglione]

3. Dreamland
Night is leaving too early
My dreams are falling away
I lie dreaming to run close
Why are you fading away from me?

Lost in you I'm going nowhere
Searching for the land of dreams (where do you live?)
Are you somewhere—somewhere in my mind?
In Dreamland?

A light flashes my mind
Brightening finally all the air
You standing tall watching me
Your eyes are pulling me over time

Lost in you I won't awake
Riding for the land of dreams
Going somewhere—somewhere in my mind
In Dreamland

Living nowhere, somewhere in my mind
Riding somewhere, going everywhere
Searching for the land of dreams (where do you live?)
... in timeless Dreamland ...

[Music: Tordiglione]
[Lyrics: Mangnani]

4. Piece Of time
Slowly (you) inflame my fantasy and open another
chapter, a moment of ludicity

Somewhere I'm waiting for a sign that shows me a direction
Let me across the Lab�rinth

I wanna a Piece of Time
I see myself in your eyes
I wanna a Piece of Time
Again to close your eyes
I wanna a Piece of Time
To dance with your lonely heart
I wanna a Piece fo Time
I please you don't forget

It's too late to make a change
This wasteland can feel my agony
I've heard the distance in your voice
I live and learn by my mistakes

Slowly (you) inflame my fantasy and open another
chapter, a moment of ludicity

I wanna a Piece of Time
I see myself in your eyes
I wanna a Piece of Time
Again to close your eyes
I wanna a Piece of Time
To dance with your lonely heart
I wanna a Piece fo Time
I please you don't forget

I wanna a Piece of Time
I see myself in your eyes
I wanna a Piece of Time
Again to close your eyes
I wanna a Piece of Time
To dance with your lonely heart
I wanna a Piece fo Time
Again to close your eyes

[Music: Magnani, Rubulotta, Tordiglione]
[Lyrics: Tordiglione]

5. Vertigo
[Instrumental]

6. In The Shade
Livin' in a wasteland
without any shadows
what's left for me to see?
I wonder with my soul

Your Angel-eyes are shining bright
I wanna take your hand
All I know is I can't live with you

In the shade, I will remember
In the shade, I will remember

Fear lives inside your mind
(but) my dream is still alive
and I'm never looking back
I'm dreaming peace and love

Find you lost in any place
I'm miles away
I'll be searching high and low

In the shade, I will remember
In the shade, I will remember

In the shade, I will remember
In the shade, I will remember

[Music: Mangnani, Tordiglione, Cantini]
[Lyrics: Tordiglione]

7. No Limits
Can you remember the time
now I'm standing in this way
All my life for this time
Why? Can you feel me in this time?
Why? Can you see me in this time?
All that we love shall burn

No limits no pretenders
no limits no tomorrow

Can you remember the time
Why? Can you feel me in this time?
Why? Can you see me in this time?
All that we love shall burn

No limits no pretenders
no limits no tomorrow

Sitting all alone in the corner
a man is on the razor's edge
now the woman's crying ...
(the) woman's into a secret place
many, many miles away
she dreams of love

No limits no pretenders
no limits no tomorrow

[Music: Mangnani, Tordiglione]
[Lyrics: Tordiglione]

8. The Right Sign
I believe in the power of love
I want to see a change in the future

take me to places I've never seen
all of you have to pay
(Gods you know?)

Ice and fire ... Where's the land of my desire?
Ice and fire ... Cast a dream and feel the power

I believe in the power of love
I want to see a change in the future

take me to places I've never seen
all of you have to pay
(Gods you know?)

Ice and fire ... Where's the land of my desire?
Ice and fire ... Cast a dream and feel the power

Ice and fire ... Where's the land of my desire?
Ice and fire ... Cast a dream and feel the power

[Music: Rubulotta, Tordiglione]
[Lyrics: Tordiglione]

9. Red Zone
I've walked in the street of yesterday
I've walked with your eyes as blue as the sky

And we learned the hard way
we wanted to live forever
everyone together

walking to red zone through the silence of night
I've looked at the city of yesterday

And we've paid with our lives
we wanted to live forever
everyway together

I've broken everything we've made ...
... we wanted to live forever
everyway together

[Music: Mangnani, Tordiglione, Rubulotta]
[Lyrics: Tordiglione]

10. Time Has Come
Too far away her eyes surround me
her smile fills my heart
and I'm awaiting for my destiny
and I've been waiting for the stranger
to show me what he knows
he's looking sad, he knows my destiny

Fantasy in my mind
She's standing near my shadow
I open my eyes (show me the way)
Too far away her eyes surround me
her smile fills my heart
and I'm looking for our destiny
and I've been waiting for the stranger
to show me what he knows
he's looking sad, he knows my destiny

Time has come (for me to live another day)
Time has come (we'll dance again ...)

Close your eyes now (you) realize a day
when we'll meet again
all this time I've wanted to say
time has come
so many tears ... don't close your eyes
I can't live without you so many days ...
and when you smile I can fly ...

Time has come (for me to live another day)
Time has come (we'll dance again ...)

Time has come (for me to live another day)
Time has come (we'll dance again ...)

[Music: Rubulotta, Tordiglione]
[Lyrics: Tordiglione]

11. Looking For...
In this Wasteland without shadows
I'm searching your eyes
I feel the rain on my eyes

Still are you dreaming?
Tears in your eyes ...
I need to live my life

[Music: Mangnani]
[Lyrics: Tordiglione]

12. Call Me
[Music: Mangnani, Rubulotta, Tordiglione, Cantini]
[Lyrics: Mangnani]

Light me now
There is a Light coming from S.O.U.L.-W.A.I.S.T.E.
This time, your voice is calling me
Moonlight so sweetly winds the maze
hard time, now I realize the ways to go

Where do you live? I feel cold in my heart
we can't see the colour of the Ocean

all your love

A light kills my enemy it shows her
Goodbye, my only hope is freedom
but you, I please you, don't be afraid
be sure one day I'll find the way

Where do you live? I feel cold in my heart
we can't see the colour of the Ocean
What do you need? I see tears in your eyes
we can't see the colour of the Ocean

Over, all alone you queen of Dreamland
I'm flying away
all the Visions behind me,
and the time has gone away

Where do you live? I feel cold in my heart
we can't see the colour of the Ocean
What do you need? I see tears in your eyes
we can't see the colour of the Ocean

13. Miles Away
[Music: Mangnani, Tordiglione, Rubulotta]
[Lyrics: Tordiglione]

Time has changed our lives
I'm searching for the answers
picking up the pieces of my live
somewhere along the way.

Can't you look me screaming?
I look for your face in this light
and you're reaching for something you never had
I'm miles
and we live the hard way
day by day
tears are far away
all the night is blinding me side by side

I'm miles away

Try to see my story from a different side
now I can remember
why I need to run.

Can't you look me screaming?
I look for your face in this light
and you're reaching for something you never had
I'm miles
and we live the hard way
live my day
tears are far away
and the night is blinding me side by side

I'm miles away
I'm miles away
I'm miles away

Time has changed our lives
I'm searching for the answers
picking up the pieces of my live
somewhere along the way.

1. Moonlight
Faced to the ivory gates of dreamsland
I look my steps being lost in the sand
Is this the place where they created your soul
Where all your tears have been shed for so long?

Moon don't tell me lies
don't let me roam forever
Moonlight take the sky
Show me the way to heaven ...

Moonlight shining in the sky
nothing more can stop my flight
Take my hand again, fly with me
thousand million miles away

Leaving the town of the ancient dreams
new reasons come to live for ...

Now that we are leaving out of maze
I can imagine all the masters' rage
Meaning is that love is stronger than hate
Meaning is that will is stronger than fate

Moon don't tell me lies
don't let me roam forever
Moonlight take the sky
Show me the way to heaven ...

Moonlight shining in the sky
nothing more can stop my flight
Take my hand again, fly with me
thousand million miles away

[SOLO: RAIN/THÖRSEN]

Moonlight shining in the sky
nothing more can stop my flight
Take my hand again, fly with me
thousand million miles away

[Magnani C., Cantarelli A., Rubulotta F.]

2. New Horizons
Another day is dying
Moonlight' shining high
Peace is winding all around
I look up to the sky
a sudden blazing light
shaking my soul to the ground

Across the seas, around the hills and over
I can feel all your love ...
Reflections of a wasted love in my eyes
unchaining from my heart

Tell me now Fathers of the Sky
why a love should die
you have damned my life
try to tell me why ...

Another day is dying
Moonlight' shining high
Peace is winding all around
Despite of Master's will
Against this destiny
I will find the way to try ...

Across the seas, around the hills and over
I can feel all your love ...
Reflections of a wasted love in my eyes
unchaining from my heart

Tell me now Fathers of the Sky
why a love should die
you have damned my life
try to tell me why ...

[SOLO: RAIN/THÖRSEN/TOGETHER]

Tell me now Fathers of the Sky
why a love should die
you have damned my life
try to tell me why ...
To new horizons fly ...

[Magnani C., Cantarelli A., Rubulotta F.]

3. The Night Of Dreams
Close your eyes, can you see?
It's the land of Secret Dreams Take my hands.
Follow me where Time escapes from Reality
Can you feel the loneliness burning in my heart?
I would need an Angel to teach me again to fly

Fly to me and save me
Heal my broken wings
Close your eyes and kiss me
'cause tonight

It's The night of Dreams
and your crystal - eyes could drive me to the light
It's The night of Dreams
and I can finally dream to fly

higher, till the sky

Every day and every night I look up for your eyes
rain is falling from the sky like tears and I don't like

Fly to me and save me
Heal my broken wings
Close your eyes and kiss me
'cause tonight

It's The night of Dreams
and your crystal - eyes could drive me to the light
It's The night of Dreams
and I can finally dream to fly

higher, till the sky

Now I wonder what I would ever have been
If I had never met you
Stars in the sky are shining as never before
Now I can answer, I know ("What is Love?")

[SOLO: THÖRSEN/RAIN]

Fly to me

It's the night

[Magnani C., Rubulotta F., F. Contini L.]

4. Lady Lost In Time
Lady, lost in time
Lady, let me try
Never lose the faith
Keep on trying once again

Wake up from the night
Flowing in your mind
time has gone, but something's left behind
... a little twinkling light ...

light of wasted memories
tell me, can you see?
Everyone has one, somewhere in his heart
... you simply gotta find.

Lady, lost in time
Lady, let me try
Never lose the faith
Keep on trying once again

Tell me what you feel
Tell me what you need
If you're calling for some help on your way
... I promise. I'll be there ...

Please don't ask me why,
Please don't make me lie
Life is like a game in wich you win or lose
but you can't ever choose

Lady, lost in time
Lady, let me try
Never lose the faith
Keep on trying once again

[SOLO: TOGETHER/RAIN/THÖRSEN]

Lady, lost in time
Lady, let me try
Never lose the faith
Keep on trying once again

[Magnani C., Cantarelli A., Rubulotta F.]

5. State Of Grace
When it's late and stars go to sleep
I lie and wait for a new Dream

My State of Grace ...

When light fades
everything 'round
melts with shades
in a Time-Escape

It's my world made for my Dreams
far away from my Fears and my Sins
and so alone I rest in peace
and I finally feel a State of Grace
It's my world so far away
from the Pain that I need everyday

So many days without a smile
I need to stay and rest for a while

In my world made of my Dreams
far away from my Fears and my Sins
and so alone I rest in peace
and I finally feel a State of Grace
It's my world so far away
from the Pain that I feel everyday

[SOLO: THÖRSEN/RAIN/TOGETHER]

It's my world made for my Dreams
far away from my Fears and my Sins
and so alone I rest in peace
and I finally feel a State of Grace
It's my world so far away
from the Pain that I need everyday

[Magnani C., Rubulotta F., Contini L.]

6. Heaven Denied
Over the starlights
There's a world nobody's seen before
... There's my world ...
I still remember

When they banished me for my sin
... and you with me ... 

"Remember my words - I said - One day I'll come back"

I'm turning back to the Heaven denied
Once i had gone, today I'll turn to light (am I dreaming?)

[SOLO: THÖRSEN]

Feelings of peace
fighting with this Harred in my heart
... I need more time ...
Stay close to me 
Close your eyes and use your heart to see
... Pure as steel ... 

And flying with me you will see
that Heaven I lost for you

I'm turning back to the Heaven denied
Once I had gone, today I'll turn to light

[SOLO: THÖRSEN/RAIN/THÖRSEN]

I'm turning back to the Heaven denied
Once i had gone, today I'll turn to light

Dayafterdayafterdayafterday ...

[Magnani C., Cantarelli F., Rubulotta F.]

7. Thunder
Look at the fire and follow the light
dancing around in the night
look at it's flames burning up, reaching out for the Sky

That is the way I could say how I feel
feeling the flame burning me
flowin' inside out my blood cold as steel

like a Thunder my Rage
Could explode in your face
Like a Thunder my Rage
Like a Thunder ...

I feel Fire is burning inside
my reason's losing the fight
my lust for Vengeance is calling and claiming my Pride

Look at the fire and follow the light
dancing around in the night
look at it's flames burning up, reaching out for the Sky

like a Thunder my Rage
Could explode in your face
Like a Thunder my Rage
Like a Thunder ...

[SOLO: THÖRSEN/RAIN]

like a Thunder my Rage
Could explode in your face
Like a Thunder my Rage
Like a Thunder ...

[Magnani C., Cantarelli F.]

8. Feel

[instrumental]

9. Time After Time
Father, please, take care of my soul
maybe I won't be so strong
Time has come for me to close my wings
and pay for my Mortal sin

You ... don't try to stop the Pain that rides
into my veins - inside
it's like a river flowing straight
fulfilled of Hate

Time after time
but what has left behind?
nothing else than lies ...
All this long time got me to find
they sealed my Heaven Denied

Stop this Hatred burning in my head
now i'd need to forget

You ... don't try to stop the Pain that rides
into my veins - inside
it's like a river flowing straight
fulfilled of Hate

Time after time
but what has left behind?
nothing else than lies ...
All this long time got me to find
they sealed my Heaven Denied

Time after time tonight
we can finally see the light
it's light of love calling me
am I dreaming, is it real?
... No more lies ...

[SOLO: RAIN/THÖRSEN]

Time after time ...

[Magnani C., Cantarelli F.]

10. Falling Rain
[SOLO: RAIN]

Deep in my heart
I would like to find a place for love
... It's not so easy as i'd like ...
and all this time, all the time we've lost
Just to follow a dream
... nothing will remain ...

The rain is falling down on me
falling down as a silent cry

Now I'm staring at the mirror and inside my heart
I can't find my inner soul
Now I'm staring at the mirror and inside my eyes
nothing but a little tear ...

It's not your way and I think you gotta find one
... a little Angel starts to cry ...
This falling rain is telling now a love is dying
... but i will live into your heart ...

The rain is falling ...

Now I'm staring ...

Deep in my heart
I would like to find a place for love
and all this time, all the time we've lost
Just to follow a dreams ...

[SOLO: RAIN/THÖRSEN]

Now I'm staring at the mirror and inside my heart
I can't find my inner soul
Now I'm staring at mirror and all around
nothing but falling rain ...

[Magnani C., Cantarelli F., Tiranti R.]

11. Die For Freedom
I hear their voices calling
I feel their eyes watching me

Nothing but few words to say
Mercy's not the one I'll pray
I won't be their slave ... no more ...

Tonight we'll pay out lust for freedom
d'you see my eyes?
They're bold and proud 'cause I don't fear the price

Die for freedom - that's the price we will pay
Die for freedom - am I dying in vain?
We faced the Masters (higher of Sins)
Die for freedom

My dreams are falling down
now I understand what it means ...

Masters call, I have to go
should I follow what they said?
Tell me now: is there a reason why?

Tonight we'll pay out lust for freedom
d'you see my eyes?
They're bold and proud 'cause I don't fear the price

Die for freedom - that's the price we will pay
Die for freedom - am I dying in vain?
We faced the Masters (higher of Sins)
Die for freedom

[SOLO: BREEZE/RAIN/THÖRSEN]

Tonight we'll pay our lust for freedom ...
Die for freedom

LABYRINTH LYRICS


1. Chapter 1
1679, hall of Versailles,
Louis the XIV is having a party.
At this court of betrayers and liars
wheel of fate's gonna turn anyway...

"Welcome to my home, again.
Enjoy your time..."

And through the darkness
candles, lighten the hall
like thousands (of) dancers
reflecting on the walls...
"Let's start the dances,
no one shall stand tall..."

Midnight time, in the hall of Versailles
greatest pleasure: a present for Louis
it's a gift from the ruler of Venice
"... Just a portrait, my daughter in it"

In a beating of the heart
the king fell in love

And through the candles
Louis starts dreamin' on...
Dramatic fancy:
the king has fallen in love!

Oh, Kathryn, through the candles
I can see your face...
Oh, can't you see?
My heart is bleeding, screaming for you...

For love or lust,
feelings or passion, who knows?
And through the candles
Louis starts dreamin' on...
The king is calling,
who will dare to deny?

2. Kathryn
What happened? I can't stand it...
I don't like this feeling...
I'm Louis, the ruler,
I always get what I want!

And I need her love.
Now, before it's too late...
Yes, I need that girl,
oh, Kathrin, now I just need you
much more than the air...

Kathryn...
You'll be mine tomorrow.
Kathryn,
passion made me blind!
Kathryn,
I will stop my sorrow
Kathryn,
when you will be mine...

My heart beats for those eyes:
They've raped my soul...
Don't tell me what is right,
kings have no fault.

I need her lips,
Till then I'll have no peace.
Lost in your image
oh, Kathryn days that will follow
will not be the same...

Kathryn...
You'll be mine tomorrow.
Kathryn,
passion made me blind!
Kathryn,
I will stop my sorrow
Kathryn,
when you will be mine...

3. Sons Of Thunder
Sounds like someone called my name...
Then, you see, I'm here...
Strange it is to find myself
in this noble place.

Sure I kneel to the king of kings
and I'll swear my loyalty

Everything you may need
(and every word you say)
just put your faith on me...

Remember our name,
it comes from inside,
stronger than all we are
sons of thunder!

Hidden in the shade we creep,
deadly as a silent blade

We are wherever
(everywhere you go)
disguised in the night...

Remember our name,
it comes from inside,
stronger than all we are
sons of thunder!

4. Elegy
So finally here we are,
I'm walking on her path.
Soon my shade will melt with the night,
setting up my trap.

And like on a spider's web
you'll get trapped by me!

Oh, no. Please don't be afraid,
I'll surely take care of you...

We are victims or hunters,
this is our life (just our life... )
and with a face like yours,
you are the nicest prize...

Once I asked to myself
how far I went for his lust,
but your finest features
really pay me off.

You've been my challenge,
but now I will set your free.

We are victims or hunters,
this is our life (just our life... )
and with a face like yours,
you are the nicest prize...

5. Behind The Mask
No, please don't cry
don't waste all your tears on this.
'cause that is life,
a destiny tough to change.

The only way to escape
from reality lives in our dreams...

No, little girl
I'm sorry but that's not a dream
don't start beggin' me:
I'm not the reason of your tears

What do you think of me?
I'm not as cruel as you may think...

Now look at me,
tell me now: what do you see?
Oh, behind the mask
there's a man who used to cry.

Now come with me
it's too late, no turning back!
Few days and a king
is going to pretend your hand...

And I'll take care of you:
they paid for this. Don't blame me.

Now look at me,
tell me now: what do you see?
Oh, behind the mask
there's a man who used to cry.

6. Touch The Rainbow
As birds are free to fly away,
so spread your wings and take your flight.
And please, forgive me, if you can
I was much too deaf to hear you cry.

Go, then, take your freedom!
Damn, I know I'm doing what is right.

So run as fast as you can,
don't ever turn back, never!
Until we'll touch the rainbow,
and a new sun will shine upon this land...

I'm not an angel, yes, I know:
I'm just a man who used to fight alone.
But now I promise: don't be afraid,
no more tears tonight.

We will save our freedom,
God I know we're doing what is right...

So run as fast as you can,
don't ever turn back, never!
Until we'll touch the rainbow,
and a new sun will shine upon this land...

My soul won't find peace in this heart
till I see solace in your sullen face...
Chills running down my spine,
as your image flows through my mind...

Still I'd die for freedom,
the only thing I'm feeling right...

So run as fast as you can,
don't ever turn back, never!
Until we'll touch the rainbow,
and a new sun will shine upon this land...

7. Rage Of The King
So, is this the end?
Well, I won't forget...
Time will give me a chance
to get my revenge.

Oh no, in the heart of kings
there's no place for love.
Oh, Kathryn, won't you take my heart?
Then I'll love no one...

Wherever you may go
you'll never be alone
even beyond the seas
you'll taste the rage of the king!

No, there is no escape
from the hate I feel...
Blood! That's what I need,
blood... So sweet to me...

Oh no, in the heart of kings
there's no place for love.
Kathryn, won't you come to me?
... Why you left me alone... ?

Wherever you may go
you'll never be alone
even beyond the seas
you'll taste the rage of the king!

Wherever you may go
you'll never be alone
even beyond the seas
you'll taste the rage

8. Save Me
Ready to leave for the pride of my King,
ready to sin for his love,
what a strange world, where a kingdom may fall
for a "caprice" of a lord...

In my hall, there's a reek of sin that flows...
lost in the darkness I can feel Your presence,
my shame won't be cleansed anymore...

Save me, oh my God!
'cause I've got to sell my soul,
won't You save me once again?
Won't You hear my silent pray?

Slave to a portrait, the king fell in love:
"bring me that girl", his final words...
Should ever a poor man, as I really am
live by his faith, or obedience...?

In my hall, there's a reek of sin that flows...
lost in the darkness I can feel Your presence,
my shame won't be cleansed anymore...

Save me, oh my God!
'cause I've got to sell my soul,
won't You save me once again?
Won't You hear my silent pray?

9. Love
I'm not the same
a warrior soul that burns away for love
I'm in a haze but there's a light, riding from her face

Maybe it could be love,
'cause you're the one who can move my heart,
no more rain on us a new day will shine...

Something inside:
a strange feel I never had in all my life...
I understand:
Kathryn, you know your stare, just take my breath away

Now I know it's love,
'cause you're the one who can move my heart,
no more rain on us a new day will shine...

Now I know it's love,
'cause you're the one who can move my heart,
no more rain on us a new day will shine...
... I've left my old life behind...

10. I Feel You
My old words and new dreams
Without taste or ideas
And your eyes make me scream
And my fear disappears

Oh, there is
No true love, oh

I feel you
Soft music is moving so lightly
A world that's exploading inside me

I feel you
Emotion is coming so brightly
Your heartbeat is pounding around me

Mi ami o no?
Mi ami o no?
Mi ami...

A sweet memory of you
And a song on the way
And the shadows of truth
Are flying away

Oh, there is
No true love, oh

I feel you
A beautiful lonely old statue
Don't leave me, you need me, come closer

I feel you
Lost island somewhere in the ocean
Two lovers are playing their first game

Mi ami o no?
Mi ami o no?
Mi ami o no?

I feel you
Strange visions are changing the desert
A wind full of dust wants to blind me

I feel you
A taste of the wild love inside me
I'm dying to meet you

Mi ami o no?
Mi ami o no?
Mi ami o no?

I feel you
I'm dying to meet you

11. Miles Away (Re-recorded)
[Japanese version bonus track]

Time has changed our lives
I'm searching for the answers
picking up the pieces of my live
somewhere along the way.

Can't you look me screaming?
I look for your face in this light
and you're reaching for something you never had
... I'm miles...
and we live the hard way
day by day
tears are far away
all the night is blinding me side by side

... I'm miles away...

Try to see my story from a different side
now I can remember
why I need to run.

Can't you look me screaming?
I look for your face in this light
and you're reaching for something you never had
... I'm miles...
and we live the hard way
live my day
tears are far away
and the night is blinding me side by side

... I'm miles away...

... I'm miles away...

... I'm miles away...

Time has changed our lives
I'm searching for the answers
picking up the pieces of my live
somewhere along the way.

1. Crossroads
Now I'm on my way
Livin' in a state of mind
Out of time

Sun is shining high
I've been driving my car fast
Since last night

Another crossroad and another choice
Road sign tells 6 miles to nowhere

No more fear to reach 'nowhere'
Am I insane?
No more reason to remain
Tied up in this reality

Maybe I am out of space
But it's better to stay away, than live today

I saw that fire that burns fed by innocent lives
I've had enough

The road is straight, I cannot see the end
But 6 miles now are almost done

No more fear to reach 'nowhere'
Am I insane?
No more reason to remain
Tied up in chains

No more fear to reach 'nowhere'
Am I insane?
No more reason to remain
Tied up in this reality

2. There Is A Way
Down in the street, I feel the heat
Even if (the) night wind blows on me
There's a fever blowing out
...as a slow disease

Depending on someone's will
It's not easy to decide
If you try to ask me how I feel
...Still alive and alone

Cry out and tell them, there is a way
Made of little signs of love and mercy
Cry out and someone will hear your voice
Maybe is not much but it's a good start

Before it's time to say goodbye
At the shadow of my cross
I just hope a change is gonna come
...a change for everyone

Too many flags without a sense
Everywhere you see the end
I believe there is a way
Cause it's not too late

Cry out and tell them, there is a way
Made of little signs of love and mercy
Cry out and someone will hear your voice
Maybe is not much but it's a good start

There is a way
I feel it today
No! Nothing is lost!

Cry out and tell them, there is a way
Made of little signs of love and mercy
Cry out and someone will hear your voice
Maybe is not much but it's a good start

Oh, there is a way

3. Lost
Heavy is the load..
Pushing down, on body and soul
Ready to explode
Time is ticking too slow..

The time is ticking too slow

Repressed rage, into a cage
I left my heart in a faded past
I cannot move, I barely stand
Mistakes and regrets as only friends

There's a world out there
And I still hang my head
I would give all my life
For a while out of these walls

A while out of these walls

Repressed rage, into a cage
I left my heart in a faded past
I cannot move, I barely stand
Mistakes and regrets as only friends

They're here for me, soon I'll be free
The hell would be easier than all this
I never prayed, don't need ya priest
My time is due, how sweet is the end..

Repressed rage, into a cage
I left my heart in a faded past
I cannot move, I barely stand
Mistakes and regrets as only friends

I never prayed, don't need ya priest
My time is due, how sweet is the end

4. Mother Earth
Across the bright light of a red sunset I saw
allthe beauty I never noticed before
Air is sweet and stroking my face as a kiss
I could never figure out a future without all this

See what we've done to mother earth No mercy, no pity we have
green and blue are turning in to black

Water is covered
by a veil of evil oil
they named it black gold

Ice is melting but ground is becoming sand
no more seasons no more spring summer or fall
exploitation will bring our lands right to the bone
what kind of future are we preparing for our sons?

See what we've done to mother earth
no mercy no pity we have
green and blue are turning in to black

Find just a reason to say "no"
or everything will soon be dead and gone lakes and seas are turning into mud

5. Waiting Tomorrow
Thinking of all the lies we told
...it wasn't so bad and now I know what it means
We are growing old,this is sad it's so hard to say
Those wheels are turning so much faster

Pay today all your dues without waiting for tomorrow
We need a white flag with ourselves
Do the best without rest for a better tomorrow
Don't left unspoken words again

Falling into a dark despair I can't find your smile
Why am I so blind?
The reasons of yesterday are gone

Light is so bright but I still can't see
Can someone guide me through this silent fog

Pay today all your dues without waiting (for) tomorrow
We need a white flag with ourselves
Do the best without rest for a better tomorrow
Don't left unspoken words again

6. Come Together
Here come old flat top he come, grooving up slowly he got
Joo joo eyeball he one, holy roller he got
Hair down to his knee, got to be a joker he just do what he please

He wear no shoeshine he got, toe jam football he got
Monkey finger he shoot, coca cola he say
I know you, you know me
One thing I can tell you is you got to be free

Come together right now over me

He bag production he got, walrus gumboot he got
Ono sideboard he one, spinal cracker he got
Feet down below his knee
Hold you in his armchair you can feel his disease

Come together right now over me

He roller coaster he got, early warning he got
Muddy water he one, mojo filter he say
One and one and one is three
Got to be good-looking cos he's so hard to see

Come together right now
Come together right now
Come together right now over me

7. Just One Day
Leave me alone
I don't wanna play
Another part in your mess

Now I need air
And I don't care
What the world is thinking

Won't be "anyone"
Without a face
A pawn in a crazy game

It's better to live
Free just one day
Than a whole life as a slave

I'll stay away
From what medias say
I'm scared of all that screaming

Don't need your thoughts
I still follow mine
And if I fall it will be my fault

8. What!!!
Everyone's looking for a direction to
Follow to reach the skies on our heads

But it's not for free,what do you think to give?
There's a price you have to pay in this life.

Tears are falling from a heaven gone
...lost,cast away on island of nowhere
Tears are falling flooding around me

Men are still the same,everyone has his truth
It's not mine it's not yours...it's...what???

Slaves to the bias,ready to judge the strange
Who's watching as evil in his eyes

Tears are falling from a heaven gone
...lost,cast away on island of nowhere
Tears are falling flooding around me

9. Coldness
The city is running too fast to realize
And old man is dying under rags 'n' dust
The streets like rivers but full of people
I never felt so alone in all my life

...I never felt so alone...

No one cares no one knows the coldness as the only law
I feel it through my veins
Hard to talk and meet the eyes, misty wheatyer on our days
Where do we go wrong??

They call it progress I call it sadness
If everyone is closed in his brainstorm
We lose the essence of a good living
Am I pathetic or just a realist?

...I call it sadness...

No one cares no one knows the coldness as the only law
I feel it through my veins
Hard to talk and meet the eyes, misty wheatyer on our days
Where do we go wrong??

10. Rusty Nail
A rusty nail
Down straight into the head
Infected brains
Communication failed

Turn off the light
Put out the fire
Free your mind free your deepest side

Red is the blood
Under each kind of skin
Green is the hope
But shame has no color

Turn off the light
Put out the fire
Free your mind free your deepest side

Never look back
Life is ahead
But don't forget your way home

11. Out Of Control
I'm sick
I'm mad
I'm feeling wrapped again
I breathe, but I'm still sinking

I'm done
I'm gone
I feel it in one bone
The walls around are falling

Voices are crying loud from inside (Crying loud from inside)

Out of control, I free fall
Through shadows and lightning
Inside a liquid terror
Don't believe your eyes

I'm dogged
I'm traced
Just wanna hide my face
I know my demons find me

You say
I'm fine
But I'm lying on the floor
The room is getting smaller

Voices are crying loud from inside (Crying loud from inside)

Out of control, I free fall
Through shadows and lightning
Inside a liquid terror
Don't believe your eyes

Can't you see what I feel
You don't know what it means
Livin' day by day waiting to die

To die

Out of control, I free fall
Through shadows and lightning
Inside a liquid terror
Don't believe your eyes

12. Wolves'N'Lambs
From the morning to the night
Breaking news of fights
All the certainties are gone
Do you get my drift?

It's another middle age
Same old fear and rage
Sneaking slowly through our feet
They are gaining ground

Comprehension for someone
Who's trying to surround us

Too many wolves in lambs' clothing ready to conquer and rule

Words of love or swords of god
Mixed and abused
Holy wars for cursed ideals
Look out they are here

Rising deadly like a gas
Stealing our breath
Planning slaughters at the shadow of distorted worths

Comprehension for someone
Who's trying to surround us

Too many wolves in lambs' clothing ready to conquer and rule

13. Smoke And Dreams
The twilight
Brings me hope and heat
Even if you're not here

Remember
What we've shared 'til now, it's a precious gift

Now you're far from me
Behind a curtain of smoke and dreams

I never wasted all in words
But I guess you know

Everytime you say 'love ya'
I forget my pain, no more falling rain

I can see your eyes
Behind a curtain of smoke and dreams

No matter where you are
Always in my heart

As a shadow I'll be close to you
Through good and bad days looking after your steps
An embrace coming from my soul
Everywhere you'll feel a little of me

As a shadow I'll be close to you
Through good and bad days looking after your steps
An embrace coming from my soul
Everywhere you'll feel a little of me

A little of me

As a shadow I'll be close to you
Through good and bad days looking after your steps
An embrace coming from my soul
Everywhere you'll feel a little of me

14. Piece Of Time
[Music: Magnani, Rubulotta, Tordiglione]
[Lyrics: Tordiglione]

Labyrinth
Slowly (you) inflame my fantasy and open another
chapter, a moment of lucidity

Somewhere I'm waiting for a sign that shows me a direction
Let me across the Labyrinth

I wanna a Piece of Time
I see myself in your eyes
I wanna a Piece of Time
Again to close your eyes
I wanna a Piece of Time
To dance with your lonely heart
I wanna a Piece of Time
I please you don't forget

It's too late to make a change
This wasteland can feel my agony
I've heard the distance in your voice
I live and learn by my mistakes

Slowly (you) inflame my fantasy and open another
chapter, a moment of lucidity

I wanna a Piece of Time
I see myself in your eyes
I wanna a Piece of Time
Again to close your eyes
I wanna a Piece of Time
To dance with your lonely heart
I wanna a Piece of Time
I please you don't forget

I wanna a Piece of Time
I see myself in your eyes
I wanna a Piece of Time
Again to close your eyes
I wanna a Piece of Time
To dance with your lonely heart
I wanna a Piece of Time
Again to close your eyes

1. L.Y.A.F.H.
Call my name through the noises of
This deafning silence
I will hear your voice as an angel's cry

The glow is painting a deep blue tapestry
Then I go....

Light years away from here
In a corner of my mind
Where I can easily hide
My real me from strangers' eyes

If you want the space is right for you and I, so
Follow me...

Light years away from here
In a corner of my mind
Where I can easily hide
My real me from strangers' eyes

Light years away from here
In a corner of my mind
I'll show you if you want
A new place for you and I

2. Deserter
Another battlefield, the history repeats itself
Just a dead machine, a number without a name or face
Welcome to hell again!

Fly away don't want to stay
I won't play your bloody game

She's alone and prays to rescue my soul but now I desert
I will take my box full of hopes and letters from home
Don't move remain in hell!

Fly away don't want to stay
I won't play your bloody game

Another battlefield, the history repeats itself
Just a dead machine, a number without a name or face
Welcome to hell again!

Fly away don't want to stay
I won't play your bloody game
Put yourself here in my place
Life is mine I take my blames

3. Dive In Open Waters
Free - I wanna be just me.... You cannot
Out - From any race or truth.... You cannot

Thinking with someone else's brain is no use but
They want us deaf and blind.... So deaf and blind

Dive in open waters
No more chains surround your arms now
Be yourself with no compromise

Dreaming - With open eyes is nice.... You cannot
Say - no to every lie they say.... You cannot

Living with someone else's face is no use but
They need us deaf and blind.... So deaf and blind

Dive in open waters
No more chains surround your arms now
Be yourself with no compromise

4. Freeman
Hard to believe when there's nothing to see
Blind faith is not for me
We had a Christ we made him bleed
....And someone took his fee

Where is my God maybe he has forgotten
Or is it just careless now

There is a place for every free man
Who wants to stay out of the flock?

Never before never so strong
The need to walk alone
Dark is the mind 'cause I don't know
What tomorrow will be

There is a place for every free man
Who wants to stay out of the flock?
Don't know if it's right or wrong
But I still sing my song
Until I have the strength to carry on

How to believe when there's too much to see
Fake faith is not for me
We are alone when we die and when we are born
Life runs fast as a storm

There is a place for every free man
Who wants to stay out of the flock?
Don't know if it's right or wrong
But still I sing my song
Until I have the strength to carry on

5. M3
Time is almost right
I can feel the adrenaline
I'm sure no one, no one can disturb my time

I'm so close to her
Just a step and I'll be there
I have the key to open a paradise on earth

No rules here
No fear dear
Engine is ready my heart starts shaking
Tonight I'll commit my crime oh yeah!!!

I don't know where my goal is
I run away from all the lies you told me

Now she is taking me to nowhere
This time I left behind me who I am

Hangin' on your wheel
Everything seems so unreal
Tires are screeching louder too close to the edge

No rules here
No fear dear
Six gears are ready to push me on the seat babe
Tonight I'll commit my crime oh yeah!!!

I don't know where my goal is
I run away from all the lies you told me

Now she is taking me to nowhere
This time I left behind me who I am

6. Face And Pay
Pride means never give up
And never say lies
Are you sure to be a right man, from deep down inside

Sometimes it's so easy to hide the reality just for a while
But sooner or later you know we have to face and pay

Masters of our future
Fortune is like a train that you can't catch
Masters of our fate
Put out the hate and now start again

Cry your reasons out loud
Fight for your line
Everything will be clear, under a new light

Sometimes it's so hard to find
The courage to take off the mask
But sooner or later you know we have to face and pay

Masters of our future
Fortune is like a train that you can't catch
Masters of our fate
Put out the hate and now start again

7. Malcolm Grey
My hands are red of blood
But it's not mine
Inside me there's no light and a frozen soul
I can't understand but I like it
Everything is clear but suddenly that piano....
That mesmerizing sound that pushes me to do it again

Can someone tell me if it's true or not
I'm scared by the pleasure I feel
Too thin is the line between dream and reality

Who is playing here??
Oh my God... The same melody
Different is the scene and new is the victim
But the old man playing is still the same
Hey you, now I wanna see your fucking face
Once for all stop it!!!
....No! It's not possible.... Your face is my face.... No

Can someone tell me if it's true or not
I'm scared by the pleasure I feel
Too thin is the line between dream and reality

Can someone tell me if it's true or not
I'm scared by the pleasure I feel
Too this is the line between dream and reality
But now I know it was just a dream.... Or not!?

8. Nothing New
Trying to remember what we've lost
Now I realize
That a new life is born

A very little step ahead
And the bad tales of yesterday (are) behind
Tomorrow won't be easy but
Our shoulders now are strong enough

Nothing new under the sun
Don't look back follow your star
Past is gone open your eyes

Everyone has a path
I wanna ride on mine with an open mind
Nothing is for free here
Sometimes the strength is hard to find

Nothing new under the sun
Don't look back follow your star
Past is gone open your eyes

9. Infidels
Again bodies on the ground
Covered by black shrouds
One more time the holy war has left his scar
But now is heavier than ever was before
Into a school.... Do I need to say more??

A media speculation
The pain here is for sale
My candle keeps on burning

Infidels but so proud about it
In the name of freedom
Preachers without love and compassion
Stay away from us

And now eggheads say the dialogue is the only way
They don't have to dig another grave today
Black widows, killers, pregnant of dynamite
A little comfort is you too will die

A media speculation
The pain here is for sale
My candle keeps on burning

Infidels but so proud about it
In the name of freedom
Preachers without love and compassion
Stay away from us

10. Meanings
White - The sheet is empty as my head
I try to full them both but I'm becoming mad

Give me a starting point, a hint
As soon as possible my friends

Everyone is looking for meanings
But sometimes there is no need
Free to decide to write following our moods

Black - My ink is flowin' from my pen
I should tell ya about a lost love or dragon's tale

I found, if you have no words to say
Don't say nothing and it's ok!

Everyone is looking for meanings
But sometimes there is no need
Free to decide to write following our moods
It's an escape from what we have around

1. The Shooting Star
Eleven years have been passing by
But dust didn't cover your memories
Time didn't make it all fade away
Pictures of something we've lived
They're all still there...

Walking on the edge of forever, like a feather in the wind
We've no chance to choose, and the breeze is our guiding light, in the night

We're like a shooting star, leaving signs on the horizon
Out of the dark we run
While we're chasing our chance to break free

Eleven years, would you say so much?
Time didn't warn us while running
What has remained of all that we had
It got covered by sands of time
(But) it still lived in our minds

Reaching for the edge of forever, unlike feathers in the wind
We refused to be taken everywhere the wind was blowing, walking on our path

We're like a shooting star, leaving signs on the horizon
Out of the dark we run
While we're chasing our chance to break free

We're like a shooting star, leaving signs on the horizon
Out of the dark we run
While we're chasing our chance to be free

Walking on the edge of forever..
Waiting for a sign..
Walking we are feathers in the wind..
Waiting just for a little sign

2. A Chance
Lie down
Close your eyes and start dreaming on
Call me, in the rays of the moonlight I'll come

Cry now, and spit out all the sorrow
Through pain, you made it to survive
Tears fall, while memories are calling
This life just broke your heart in two

Before the dawn announces a new day
Tonight we have a chance to live our dream
And make it happen to meet again

I'm here, from a place out of memory
Hold me, cause tonight we've a chance to be free

The sound of stars is like some music
Your voice is whispering my name
Go back to dreamland and just call me
Then wait, I promise I'll be there

Before the dawn tears this night away
I'll find again the way to reach your soul
And once again I'll make it through the maze

I'm here, from a place out of memory
Hold me, cause tonight we've a chance to be free

Before the dawn tears this night away
I'll find again the way to reach your soul
And once again I'll make it through the maze

I'm here, from a place out of memory
Hold me, cause tonight we've a chance to be free

3. Like Shadows In The Dark
Dear, I'm here
Look at me
After so many years I'm once again with you
Now put your hand on my heart

We were free and we were one
Tonight it's you and me and no one else around
Come and stay here by my side, and let's fly again

Floating
We're like shadows in the dark
Reaching, for some freedom
Your eyes
Are still crystals shining bright
They banished me from heaven
You gave me light

Lost in time
I tried to reach you
I crossed the mists of time, the trip was long and tough
My love for you took me back to life again

Floating
We're like shadows in the dark
Reaching, for some freedom
Your eyes
Are still crystals shining bright
They banned me out of heaven
You gave me light

Floating
We're like shadows in the dark
Reaching, for some freedom
Your eyes
Are still crystals shining bright
They banned me out of heaven
You gave me light

We all live in the dark
But our hope still alive
 
We all live in the dark
But our hope still alive
 
We all live in the dark
But our hope still alive
 
We all live in the past
But our hope still alive
 
We all live in the dark
But our hope still alive

4. Princess Of The Night
There's no time to waste
They're still on our path
Like hound dogs with their prey
But they can't read your mind
Princess of the night
Still your dreams are safe

Open gates of dreamland
That's the only way to escape

Princess of the night
Can you hear they're coming?
We must run tonight
Don't you stop running
Through the gates of dreams
We will find salvation
In a lake of tears
They will sink and drown

So they are fed by hate
They can't stand our pride
(As) We don't fear their might

The skies will break and fall
Till they find us all
Bounded by their lore

Open gates of dreamland
That's the only way to escape

Princess of the night
Can you hear they're coming?
We must run tonight
Don't you stop running
Through the gates of dreams
We will find salvation
In a lake of tears
They will sink and drown

Princess of the night
Can you hear they're coming?
We must run tonight
Don't you stop running
Through the gates of dreams
We will find salvation
In a lake of tears
They will sink and drown

5. Sailors Of Time
Follow me
Where the time's no rules
Where the space is not a bound
Come with me
In the dusk we'll dance
While the stars will glitter all around

We will fly
Through the bluest skies
To the infinite together
No more pain
Running inside your veins
We will make our way to heaven

Hands of the watch
Are stopping tonight
We're going back home
Like sailors of time

Drops of dew
In the morning's light
The first dawn of our new life

Hands of the watch
Are stopping tonight
We're going back home
Like sailors of time

Hands of the watch
Are stopping tonight
We're going back home
Like sailors of time

We are sailors

6. To Where We Belong
Crossing the lands
Through the ivory gates of dreams
We start our trip in search for freedom
We push our souls
Through the folds of space and time
In search for hopes we never found

And tonight we won't fail
It is do or die
When tomorrow comes
We will hail to the new sun

Feel the wind on your face
While we ride
It's the cold wind of freedom
Two small points in the sky
Tiny lights
Going back to where we belong

Look at the world
We are leaving it behind
Our trip has started, now we're moving forth

No turning back
From the choices we have made
We're ending now what (we) started years ago

And tonight we won't fail
It is do or die
When tomorrow comes
We will hail to the new sun

Feel the wind on your face
While we ride
It's the cold wind of freedom
Two small points in the sky
Tiny lights
Going back to where we belong

Feel the wind on your face
While we ride
It's the cold wind of freedom
Two small points in the sky
Tiny lights
Going back to where we belong

7. A Midnight Autumn's Dream
I can't forget
When I saw you the first time
It seems a life ago
Still I recall
A single smile from you
And I felt the peace of mind
The storm I had inside
Suddenly turned into quiet

Was it luck, or fate?
I don't know, trust me
But it's real and I won't ever let it go

Nights wouldn't be so beautiful
Without stars, without the moon
And their lights reflecting on the horizon
Shine like those stars for me, would you?
Cause this midnight autumn's dream
Will be perfect if you smile for me tonight

Now take my hand
And let's do the walk of life
Together if you want
Side by side

Now take my hand
And let's do the walk of life
Together if you want
Side by side

Nights wouldn't be so beautiful
Without stars, without the moon
And their lights reflecting on the horizon
Shine like those stars for me, would you?
Cause this midnight autumn's dream
Will be perfect if you smile for me tonight

Was it luck, or fate?
I don't know, trust me
But it's real and I won't ever let it go

Nights wouldn't be so beautiful
Without stars, without the moon
And their lights reflecting on the horizon
Shine like those stars for me, would you?
Cause this midnight autumn's dream
Will be perfect if you smile for me tonight

8. The Morning's Call
Every night comes to an end
And the dark must make way to the incoming light
For how magic was this dream
A new dawn comes in place of the night

Look at the rising sun
It's calling sleepers to wake

Black is turning into blue
Blue will turn then into black in this turnabout

It's time to go, pale moon
The sunlight claims for it's time

When sun rises up
It's time to awake
And leave your dreams with the dying night
Stand up and live
Walk in the new dawn, and hear the morning's call

Turn your head in bed
And be ready to leave the lands of fantasy
Time to go back to reality
But I'll live on inside your mind

It's time to go, pale moon
The sunlight claims for it's time

When sun rises up
It's time to awake
And leave your dreams with the dying night
Stand up and live
Walk in the new dawn, and hear the morning's call

9. In This Void
It was nice, but now I realize you were not here
Seemed so true, (I) still feel you on my skin
In this void I remain

So real to tear down my life
Blinding lucidity that scars me deep inside
If I could freeze the time right now
I'd keep your image safe inside my wounded heart

I never prayed, but in this morning light
Lord, I need your bless
Take this soul or give me back again
All I had last night

So real to tear down my life
Blinding lucidity that scars me deep inside
If I could freeze the time right now
I'd keep your image safe inside my wounded heart

So real to tear down my life
Blinding lucidity that scars me deep inside
If I could freeze the time right now
I'd keep your image safe inside my wounded heart

10. A Painting On The Wall
Like a hall with paintings on the wall
In our mind are living memories
Pictures of our life
They won't ever fade away
Living there for us to see
Whenever we need

Before you wake up
Draw a painting of us together
And keep it for when I'll be gone
Before you awake I'll draw
A picture of me on your wall
So that you won't feel alone

When tomorrow you will cry alone
Dry your tears, don't think of what you've lost
Think of what you had
Take your brushes, do it then
Paint it all before it fades, lost in time

Before you wake up
Draw a painting of us together
And keep it for when I'll be gone
Before you awake I'll draw
A picture of me on your wall
So that you won't feel alone

Before you wake up
Draw a painting of us together
And keep it for when I'll be gone
Before you awake I'll draw
A picture of me on your wall
So that you won't feel alone

1. The Prophet
It was a nite dark 'n' cold
Same old situation on the streets
No one was thinkin' 'bout what should become
When a strange man started to say
Sinners you are you've got no shame for
The evil you've done Lord sweep away this modern Sodom
Save our souls
Cries in downtown The Ground is shakin'
End is near blindin' fear Cries in downtown
No way to run Thy will is done
Eyes full of dread 'roundthat man
The prophet continued his warning
But in between blades of fire From the clouds
Burn everything that he said
Sinners you are now you will pay for The evil you've done
Lord sweep away this modern Sodom
Save our soul

2. Livin' In A Maze
Through the years good 'n' bad times we've walked
Lookin' for a dream that someone stole away
Where is the right way to get out of this maze?
Someone is lost inside it but we won't forget

Everything we had before
Seems to be so far away now there's no anger in our hearts
Just the will to make it better We are on the run again !

No pain livin' in a maze Our fate we face
Always livin' in a maze This time we won't loose the race

How many blind alleys we found along the road
But now is the time to reach the out let soon

3. This World
Too blind to see the truth
Too dumb to remember
What we learned from a past still so near
We forget so easily
Bad winds are blowin' on our peace
Dark wings have bought us to insanity
Is this the time to say our prayers?

Is this the time to take our blames ?
We need just as a language Whitout words or symbols
Something made of a common respect for life

4. Just Soldiers (Stay Down)
Sound of pipes war's all around I'm creepin' on the ground
I wonder why I do this Stay down and load your gun
I don't know if it's worth while I'm near the fighting line
The breath of death is close to me
No way to avoid all this madness around here
Oh my god please tell me what is right
What is the price?
Glory fame and pride
No! I won't obey
Then you'll have to die
The soil is red of our blood
I'm sinkin' in the mud
A sinner voice is saying: Stay down and play your game
Now I'm facing the enemy
But hey, he's the same as me
A man who fights for someone's fault

5. Neverending Rest
Ride In the night Everywhere you feel so lonely
And tangled down
Hi nice and brainy guy You could quickly know our mood and feel
The lost meanings Oh, here your mouse is saying you'll run again
Maybe he's waiting a new dawn
Freedom for sale could mean to touch the sunshine
And now the time has come And everywhere I see your lovely faces
Your rattling honest road Walk by my side
No one live around the end and tears are crystalized
Oh no, angels please Hold in your young hands the sense of mercy
Your thin arms blinded me
Oh, yes your smile will stay here forever
World's turning a new day has come
Unknown freedom will bleed around the sunrise
You know the answer? And everywhere we'll see your lovely ladies
Your rattling honest road

6. Terzinato
This is a new step we are walkin' to a new life
Stupid is trying to a contol the sounds of time
Leave them - live them - grow up and learn
Taste them - keep them - until the end
The goal is still so close 
But heard to reach it
We never loose the hope it's a game of patience
Standin' in the wings ready for our turn
Standin' in the wings the light will shine on us one day
How many people are waitin' to see the show
I feel the adrenaline run into my blood 
Face them - rock them - put on the fire
Amaze them - catch them - until the end

7. Slave To The Night
Let me introduce myself I'm your fear
Do you really know who I am?
I'll be everything you need or dream of
I'll slowly take you to the end So many times I wish I wasn't
Only a shade But at the sunset I feel somethin'
Burn inside me Slave to the night
I can hear your heartbeat while you sleepin'
Greed takes possession of me
Let me sink my teeth into your young throat
Hey don't turn you back to me now
It's so hard to live forever alone
Ther's no rest for me And no love at all
Always lookin' for somethin' I can't have
In this darkness now I'm becomin' mad
'cause I know this nite I will kill again
Now in the end I'm still lookin' for Someone to love
But than the sunset I feel somethin'
Burn inside me

8. Synthetic Paradise
No more ways to hide your face
In a corner you are friend
Please don't give me your claim and lie
Look at me straight in the eys
But tell me where is the fun
You're alone now
How can you waste all your life
You're deep in trouble man
If you wanna stop your bllody mess
Run by our side
The you will live a real world of dream 
Rise your voice 'n' sing with me
Your synthetic paradise
It's the illusion of a moment
It's easyer tha to fight to survive
You won't keep yourself alive

9. Hand In Hand
My mind is clear as the sky, For the first time
I can see what I left behind my shoulders
I don't care if the world keeps on turning
I'll be strong if you stay here by my side
and walkin' hand in hand again
we live our life with just a smile
No words to explain what love can realize
Fragile like a flower and stronger than a storm
Goodbye sun welcome moon my old friend
How I dreamed how I cried under your eyes
I don't care if the rain keeps on falling
I'll be there to repair your every time
No words to explain what love can realize
Fragile like a flower and stronger than a storm
No more dark hours into my heart 
You color my days and that is all I want

10. When I Will Fly Far
My soul is burning now 'cuz years ago you gave me secret sorrows
I've seen the ice through your eyes
How could you've been untrue nice sad and hollow
Bad things crawl inside my heart To live is hard now and
I' getting son mad Blood will flow please life return
Oh I don't if winds still blow
And where I will heal my wounds
But you'll give me warmth again 
When I'll get home Or when I will fly far
Crazyness start to creep
Day by day my rage seems to be hallowed
But I will fly so high
And from now on shout
Should be in your honour
Bad things crawl deep inside my heart
To live is hard now and
I'm getting so mad
Blood will flow please life return

1. Bullets
I saw misery and scorn
From who has no respect for life
They are trying to make us slaves
Through false religions and lies
No one is saved 'cause it's all programmed
The line between fake and real
Is so thin, impossible to see
Nothing is free

We are running out of time
And all our certainties are shattered and scattered
Blood is turned into mud
There is nothing to say
The damage is done

The last bow to a stunned crowd
And an AK starts to sing
Bullets are filling the air
Cowardice has been stronger than this
No one is saved 'cause it's all programmed
The line between fake and real
It's so thin impossible to see
Nothing is free

[Solo: Olaf, Andrea, Oleg]

No one is saved 'cause it's all programmed
The line between fake and real
It's so thin impossible to see
Nothing is free

We are running out of time
And all our certainties are shattered and scattered
Blood is turned into mud
There is nothing to say
The damage is done

2. Still Alive
We are surrounded by the same old rules
All in a row in a production line
Just waiting for the stamp that says 'approved'
An army of silent replicants

The wheels of life are turning
Running rings around
A preset deadline
Impossible to evade

No matter if it's near or far away
Our goal is like a dream
Still alive 'til our heart dances its magic dance
No matter if they want us deaf and blind
We are free to fall or reach the highest sky

This falling rain has washed away the stains
The slate is clean but only for a while
A picture really clear comes in our minds
But someone wants to draw a different line

The wheels of life are turning
Running rings around
A preset deadline
Impossible to evade

No matter if it's near or far away
Our goal is like a dream
Still alive 'til our heart dances its magic dance
No matter if they want us deaf and blind
We are free to fall or reach the highest sky

[Solo: Olaf / Andrea / Oleg]

No matter if it's near or far away
Our goal is like a dream
Still alive 'til our heat dances its magic dance
No matter if they want us deaf or blind
We are free to fall or reach the highest sky

3. Take On My Legacy
Angel's voices are calling me
Don't know if I'm strong enough
I'll be there to see and hear
If the thunder roars again
The anger in me is still alive
I'm brandishing my sword against all odds

There's a light coming from a mountain high
From a crack I can see the demons' eyes
Like a shadow I'll reach their forbidden lair
To bring them my rage

The wolves in me are now unleashed
The gods above are blessing me
If I don't come back don't cry
Get ready to take on my legacy

There's a light coming from a mountain high
From a crack I can see the demons' eyes
Like a shadow I'll reach their forbidden lair
To bring them my rage

[Solo: Olaf / Andrea]

There's a light coming from a mountain high
From a crack I can see the demons' eyes
Like a shadow I'll reach their forbidden lair
To bring them my rage

4. A New Dream
All around things are changing
For everyone of us
I feel the need to rest my heart and mind

Go, if you wanna go
And never look back in anger
But if you wanna stay
Measure all your words, you don't have to complain
Sooner or later
It'll be your turn again
Are you experienced to hold the reins?

Don't be afraid today
Do not be scared to change the road you're on

No! Maybe you don't know
Our brain is infected
Stop look into my eyes
And tell me where we went wrong
Once and for all
Sooner or later
It'll be your turn again
Are you experienced to keep the route?

Don't be afraid today
Do not be scared to change the road you're on

[Solo: Oleg / Olaf / Andrea]

Don't be afraid today
Do not be scared to change the road you're on

Don't be afraid today
The sands are flowing and a new dream will come for each one of us

5. Someone Says
I woke up in silence
With another day of life ahead
I'm breathing I'm feeling like before a hurricane
No boredom and no turning back
We start again

From the darkness to the morning light
Looking for the grace I left behind
Someone says I need to turn the page
But I can't

Rain's falling on wet ground
Nothing seems like yesterday
I'm rolling my two dices
Trying to fool and change my fate
No boredom and no turning back
Life's ahead

From the darkness to the morning light
Looking for the grace I left behind
Someone says I need to turn the page
But I can't

[Solo: Olaf / Andrea / Oleg]

From the darkness to the morning light
Looking for the grace I left behind
Someone says I need to turn the page
But I can't

From the darkness to the morning light
Trying to fix the pain I left behind
Someone says I need to turn the page
Now I can

6. Random Logic
[Instrumental]
7. Architecture Of A God
There's an old man in the night
Sitting all alone, in the moonlight
...and there he smiles

On an old and broken chair
Staring at a wall he tries to catch
The reflections of all his thoughts
To understand the Architecture of a God

He's an old man, from a far past
But when he was a boy he used to dream
Of himself old, sitting right there
At the same wall, wondering

And he wonders if it's all just a joke
Or it's another dream he's having as a boy

Past and future glide
Both are parts of the same line
Drawn by an inscrutable Architect
It depends on which way you decide to walk that line
While the Architect sets our lives

Many hopes and dreams we have
While we're young and long seems life
...we've plenty of time

And the memories then come
In a back and forth game
We all run, while He's working upon us
In this big Architecture of a God

Like that old, from a far past
We were boys who used to dream many lives
Building ten, a hundred million
While stars are dancing all around

Will we wonder if it was all just a joke?
Will we try to read our life from right to left?

Past and future glide
Both are parts of the same line
Drawn by an inscrutable Architect
It depends on which way
You decide to walk that line
While the Architect sets our life

[Solo: Andrea / Olaf]

Will we wonder if it was just a joke?
Will we try to read our life from right to left?

Past and future glide
Both are parts of the same line
Drawn by an inscrutable Architect
It depends on which way you decide to walk that line
While the Architect sets our lives

8. Children
[Instrumental][originally by Robert Miles]
9. Those Days
Between space and time there's only a this curtain
You will find me there just for a little while
Everything was lost or at least is what I thought
It's not over yet but the worst is over
Call my name and the sunshine wakes me up
From a winter's tale that froze all my hopes

My heart was trapped in a block of marble
For so long
Your love has carved it out from that cold stone
And I still bless those days

I never understand, what's forever for
An eternal flame weaker than a candle
Feel my pain that now is vanishing
Finally I can breathe and I give myself to you

My heart was trapped in a block of marble
For so long
Your love has carved it out from that cold stone
And I still bless those days

[Solo: Andrea / Olaf]

My heart was trapped in a block of marble
For so long
Your love has carved it out from that cold stone
And I still bless those days

10. We Belong To Yesterday
From the biosphere to the deepest sea
We search for freedom and serenity
Our wings are strong enough to bare the winds
Blowing as they never did before
Don't you forget our name, it's carved in hard stone
Don't let our faces fade away, be gone
Louder our chant resounds, tonight we're coming
Listen to what we're crying

We belong to yesterday
And we face the future but we know that
We belong to yesterday
We are shadows from the past but this time
We come again to stay

Time is almost due but no one seems to care
This road is bringing us straight to nowhere
Anyway I will be there to take your hand
Showing you the path to the new world
Did you forget our names?
They're carved in those stones
Did you just let our faces fade away?
Open your eyes up wide, 'cause we're back for good
Listen to what we're crying

We belong to yesterday
And we face the future but we know that
We belong to yesterday
We are shadows from the past but this time
We come again to stay

[Solo: Olaf / Andrea]

We belong to yesterday
And we face the future but we know that
We belong to yesterday
We are shadows from the past but this time
We come again to stay

11. Stardust And Ashes
Scream from the top of your lungs
All your despair
Hear the echo of your regrets
There is an inner voice that says
Don't complain!
You're made of stardust and ashes my friend

Is this the beginning or the end?
History repeats itself over and over
Is this heaven's gate or just the hell?
We'll find it out between the dusk and darkness

Feel deep down inside the pain you have caused
Stop to blame someone else, face your guilt
Cry a river of tears to save your soul
Pay for your dues there is so much to do

Is this the beginning or the end?
History repeats itself over and over
Is this heaven's gate or just the hell?
We'll find it out between the dusk and darkness

[Solo: Andrea / Olaf / Nik / Oleg]

Is this the beginning or the end?
History repeats itself over and over
Is this heaven's gate or just the hell?
We'll find it out between the dusk and darkness

12. Diamond
[Solo: Olaf]

We are like diamonds
All of us, we're the most precious thing
We could shine like no others
But sometimes, some of us end up unfinished

Dirty stones to be thrown
A pale hint of what we could have been
While our poor lives carry on
But we know we could have been

...a diamond

1. The Quickening
[Instrumental]

2. Heart Of Storm
Rising from the ruins
Yet my mind is burning
Flames reflect those years of torment
Life that drowned in fire
Death was my desire
Path of hate was a relief for me

And then we stood there eye to eye
The darkest grief against a pure heart
Life baptised in metal By the secret of steel you are blessed, hail!!!
Gift of power helps you vanquish All the mortal's plagues

Heart of storm - I feel... the force is clean again
Heart of storm - deep inside of me
Heart of storm - and when I tear all roots of pain,
Heart of storm - grief and agony, then I'll be free

Hey! Ride on the wind!

Lightning pierced my body
Back again I'm rising
Now you hear my primal calling
Shout out even higher
War's now our revival!
Voice of truth is cryin' out for me

And now we're standing side by side
The tamed old hatreds next to mine
Watch me ride on the thunder
Followed by the warriors of steel, hail!!!
Strive for justice, fight for freedom
Yeah! This war is real!

Heart of storm - I know... the force is clean again
Heart of storm - all inside of me
Heart of storm - and now I kill all grief and pain
Heart of storm - Hey! And I kill the misery!

Now the force is clean again
All inside of me
And as I've killed all grief and pain
I crushed the agony, and now I'm free

And my heart of storm

I know... I know everything
I am everything
I'm alive

3. Sworn In Metal Wind
Walking in the shadow of life's dreary side
Fallen down memory lane
Winds whip the world, just like the woes whip my mind
Where is that time when "right now" was The words
When the heart burned with will like a flare
All I now keep is just damned commonplace misery

Hey man! What is this?!
Sounds like wail of a wimp
Did you let loser side take command?!
Where's the warrior in you
And the spirit he got
You say - "lost"
No! It's somewhere inside
And you know there's a force that unites all of us
Leave the wasteland we together will!
If you're broken, remember, you got faith within us!
Take now your next deep breath and revive
your old strength

Facing the abyss of heart's lonely grief
The bitch has polluted my soul
Rains flood the earth, just like the tears flood my eyes
Never again will my life be the same
Nothing can heal up my wounds
Guile and disgrace shall now follow me into the end

I just can not believe it
It's too weak to be true
Have you really forgotten your worth?!
Can't you see victory!?
You are now free again!
Look at me!
Yeah! I live my own life
If you once tasted treason from a female - leave that!
Every warrior has a gash on his sword
Don't forget you are metal, not some ass-kissing whore
Take some under your wings, but she must kiss the ring!

Winds of metal, make me once again
feel clear air's breath blowing in my wings!

I possess magic force
I am free in my words
Whole the world lays right below my feet
Life of duties and dogmas are just frames formed by rats
How'd I know?
Hey! I'm a guardian of truth
Now! Is really the time to wake up you old jade
Such as Phoenix spreads his firewings
I will help you remember by kicking your ass

And the will shall return
And again hearts shall burn
All the horns now will sing
Leading you back to the metal winds

4. The Song Of Air
[Instrumental]

5. World Through My Fateless Eyes
In the dawn of me, back at my spring of life
A mystic cry touched my soul
Just like a dream... a shine filled up it's sphere
My mind it was free and the secret's key was for me there

Magic voice that came... strain from another world
Of beauty not to believe
All then I heard was for me like a soul's reverie
And the voice... it sang my name

And through the all painful years that should come
That magic was there by my side
Power that led to I lost fear of death
Hatred that covered its meaning
I hail my senses that help me to see
so clear in my mind
All rotten "truth" and the doctrines which words
make us blind

I see the world through my fateless eyes

Pain be the sign, and the insight the guide
On this journey of unforeseen end
Enlightened by force of the unflagging faith
Through these wastelands I walk my own path
Damn the fate! You're one with your soul
and you must pave it's way by yourself

Out of nowhere the storm is coming on
The blare that surrounds helps me dream in
Enchanting me, while the spirit is rising again
And the storm... it sings my name

So as I walk on the path I believe
The force's always gracing my steps
Now in the name of the new risen will
I shall discomfit my fear!
And when the pinions of knowledge
like thunder, so mighty, will carry me on
All pain and grief and the weakness in me
shall be gone

I see the world through my fateless eyes

6. Perfect Warrior
I was falling into the boundless sea
I'm the sacred one who chose to change this world
Everything I hate to see...
Everyone I hate to hear...
Raise your sword and never fall again

I was calling, world never answered me
Time was standing still and life plunged into ruin
Everything I hate to see...
Everyone I hate to hear...
Hold your head up high and spread your words

Mob of "right", I despise your way of life!
I'm a "sinner", yet forgive me nothing
I'm a "heathen", but forever free

Remember!
If you try to break my wings
If you dare to watch my dreams
You'll forever bare your blame
In the name of pain

Remember!
If you try to break my wings
If you try to steal my dreams
You will never free your name
From the chains of pain

If you try to break my wings
If you dare to touch my dreams
Then my curse will be your pain

7. Denial Of Fate
Tribunal of senseless rabble
Built on fear and congruous prophecies
Twisting minds with planned hypocrisy
By the fools the clear're surrounded
Blind are deaf and deaf are blinded
Grant themselves the dream of destiny

Eternal path has not been "meant" for thee
The myth of fate you must tear by force

Get away!
Feel the taste of freedom, ride on wind
Let your mind see things world never seen
As you weed your life from the hope of fate
Find the way you shall within yourself

Clouds of might eclipse the horizon
Darkened sky as long as eye can see
Winds arise in wrath released by me
Now I spread the wings of fire
Flames of rage arise in power
The time has come to shed my burning will

Eternal path has not been "meant" for thee
The myth of fate you must tear by force

Get away!
Feel the taste of freedom, ride on wind
Let your mind see things world never seen
As you weed your life from the hope of fate
Find the way you shall within yourself

Feel the taste of freedom, ride on wind
Let your mind see things world never seen
As you weed your life from the hope of fate
Find the way you shall within yourself

Feel the taste of freedom, ride on wind
Let your mind see things world never seen
As you weed your life from the hope of fate
Find the way you shall within yourself

8. Welcome Back
Out of the sun, out of the night
Comes the morning light
Just another day breaks
Under the same sky
As the misty dawning fades away to its lair
Silence and peace fills the air
While this placid day reflects its calm
Feeling the chill of a distant zone
Hear the lost ones' cry from miles away
Wishing they were gone to another day
But the wishes give no hide
And the beasts you dread dwells in disguise

As the smoke covers my eyes
Mystic sight reveals
A doleful land among the shadows
Where only lost men go
Struggling in the night
Grief I see in their eyes

The sun is blackened while they fight
But the fire of hatred's rising high
The commands were only lies
Around me young men die

Welcome back, to the days of thunder!
Welcome back, to the days where you were born!
Welcome back, to break the spell you're under!
Welcome back, to the days of thunder!
Welcome back, to the days where you were born!
Welcome back, to raise again your honour!

What about the life...
that shined so bright once in your eyes?
What about the death... faith you lost...
so that was your quest?
What about the dreams...
there where no visions in your grief?
What about the fight...
that graced your life?

Water, fire, wind and soil
My soul came to be reborn
As the lightning thrashes black skies
The spirit fills my mind

Welcome back, to the days of thunder!
Welcome back, to the days where you were born!
Welcome back, to break the spell you're under!
Welcome back, to the days of thunder!
Welcome back, to the days where you were born!
Welcome back, to raise again your honour!

What about the life...
It shines so bright now in my eyes!
What about the death...
Faith I found, now life's my quest!
What about the dreams...
There're new visions in my grief!
What about the fight...
It graces my life!

Out of the fire
Out of the wind
Out of the water and soil
I'm reborn

9. The Kingdom Of My Will
Riding from wastelands
Black were their skies
My armour's still bleeding
Ripped by fire and ice

Watch the horseman wing out of the night
He's coming to save you, prepare! For now he arrives

Mounting through stormlands
With the wind in my hair
The spell I've broken...
...like the chains of despair

Share this flame that guides me in the dark
The spirit of metal, the legacy of our kind

To the kingdom of my will
From dungeons of emotions
Wisdom's voice is guiding me
Leads me through all tortures
Eyes of faith for me to see
The rotten deeds of liars
World that've turned to misery I brave
And the pure shall prevail

The misery I brave! Hey!
Led by that golden voice

Slaves of corruption
You'll fall by my hand
And all mindoppressors
Will be chased to the end

Fear the steel that's meant for all you rats!
The essence of insight, the truth,
that longs for your heads

To the kingdom of my will
From dungeons of emotions
Wisdom's voice is guiding me
Leads me through all tortures
Cross the life's unflagging sea
Through air I fly on thunder
Gift of force is meant for me
Refills my desolate shell

To the kingdom of my will
From dungeons of emotions
Wisdom's voice is guiding me
Leads me through all tortures
Forced to yield the hypocrites
But orders I'll not follow
Worms of lie surrounding me
Now see my wings of war!
The battle's confronting me
And for me... the battle has started again

Now see!

If you think I rest in wait
Until the fame will shine on me...
Through the mist I led myself!
The peak of dreams I reach by will!

Today is The Day!
Today is The Day!
Today is The Day!
Today is The Day!
Today is The Day!
Today is The Day!
Today is The Day!

Hey! You!

Hey!
If you think I rest in wait
Until the fame will shine on me...
Through the mist I led myself!
The peak of dreams I reach by will!

To the kingdom of my will
From dungeons of emotions
Wisdom's voice is guiding me
Leads me through all tortures
Cross the life's unflagging sea
Through air I fly on thunder
Gift of force is meant for me
Refills the chambers of my heart

On virgin soil serpents are born
Blind are their eyes, blinding's their bane
Feigned happiness real is as death
Hypocrites' plague infects the mind of man

There is that fear like a curse extending in veins
There is that torment that impairs thee
Roving in shadows
Yet with flame that glows in my heart
There on my way all alone, so alone, not alone

Only with eyes of a pure heart
Maybe some day you can see me
Faith be your guide when the sorrow encircles your self
Walking the path of a pure heart
Maybe someday you can meet me
Faith be your shine if the anguish eclipses your sight

Under the skin innocence breathes
Inherent grace, free from this waste
Insight and pain - sacred romance
Freedom not greed - a doubtless choice for me to make

There is a pureness that so real reveals in my dreams
There is a beauty that I long for
Covered by shadows, yet it's there so close in my sight

Waiting till shades are gone
Waiting till shades are gone...

Hailed shall be the ones who see what others can not
For no assumption I will waste my reason
The promised lands of sand are raised and troths build on tales
From heights I now behold the circus' credo

Hailed shall be the ones who see what others can not
For no assumption I will waste my reason
The promised lands of sand are raised and troths build on tales
From heights I now behold the circus' credo

Only with eyes of a pure heart
Maybe some day you can see me
Faith be your guide when the sorrow encircles your self
Walking the path of a pure heart
Maybe someday you can meet me
Faith be your shine if the anguish eclipses your sight

3. Lost In The Depths Of Me
[Music & Lyrics: Wojtek Lisicki]

[Solo: Equilibrian Epicurius]

Down in the ashes wounded I crawl
Pray shall I not - god is gone
Lonely, but mighty, insight's my home
Into that shine now and again I will go

Stars gleam on my way, darkness chants for me
Into the depth I can see
Frozen, but conscious, spirit is my warmth
Wings of true will are carrying me through this world

But the world still is drowned in ecstasy
Of the fate and the myth of gods
But I doubt there's a journey planned for me
As I own every moment of my life
And the blessed they shall call it blasphemy
But I know what I think is right
Still the sun and the stars whill shine for me
For the pure I will fight
For no king I will die
For my thoughts I will live

Rambling in pain, drowning is sorrow, burning in hate
Why all this grief...
Chains not on me! I'm not a chosen one!!!

Fate for the mortals
Eyes for the searching ones
Don't dare you pray for me
When the faith is gone!
Lost in the depths of me

[Solo: Equilibrian Epicurius]

For the mind of the world I share my eyes
Truths' arms embrace these words
All the ones who lost their hope
Look deep in your ego - you'll find it there!
For the mind of the world
I share my breath
In mystic empathy
From the awe I healed my heart
And now as I tell this
I don't fear no more!

Rambling in pain, drowning is sorrow, burning in hate
Why all this grief...
Chains not on me! I'm not a chosen one!!!

Fate for the mortals
Eyes for the searching ones
Don't dare you pray for me
When the faith is gone!
Lost in the depths of me

4. Again Will The Fire Burn
[Music & Lyrics: Wojtek Lisicki]

Voices like wind...
Wordless their whispers...
I hear them!
Wandering alone, strayed form the path
Lost in the gales of despair

I see the shades wasting their last dreams
Hiding their woes... just for themselves
Only with fear as remains

Yet free you always can be
And dreams like ravens return
Some minds like diamonds survive
Again will the fire burn

Strain in the air...
Like crystal bells...
Now listen!
Deep in your mind search once again
Magical essence is there!

I brought my flame back from the shadows
Lost in the cold darks of this world
Will is the power I hail!

Yet free you always can be
And dreams like ravens return
Some minds like diamonds survive
Again will the fire burn

[Solo: Trascendental Protagonist]

6. Cry Of A Restless Soul
[Music & Lyrics: Wojtek Lisicki]

Hail to thee, Oh force of will
For awakening minds!
There for me from earliest days
Made this tale so mine

Storm...you almighty, earth, seas and flames
Here I am standing
Bare in my honesty
Calm in the moonshine
Starlight rests my eyes
Pain wakes me conscious
Truth guides my mind

Shine in my heart... strange colours embracing me
I'm not alone in a way
Wrath in my depths brings me to see I'm a warrior soul

Tortured minds... like a cloud they swarm around me
If I said my soul is screaming - would you believe in me!
Secret cry... hear the souls there howling, howling
While their salvation is so near

Deep inside it's always my time
All around it's only a world no one owns
Deep in heart it's always my time
Grief is nothing life should be
Never bend for misery!
Always standing
Always searching
Always free

Will is the power!

Strayed spirits before me, I see flames still burning
Hearts wounded, transformed
Yet not into grey, cold stones

Innocent days, life full of breath
That is the time I am crying for
Fly free again through virgin lands
That is the life I will fight for to regain

Turn around! All the founts you'll find behind you
If I said my heart is burning - would you believe in me!
Years flow by, still you drown is caustic memories
Embrace the best and face old grief

Deep inside it's always my time
All around it's only a world no one owns
Deep in heart it's always my time
Searching for a true relief
Finding life will be your first
Last one'll be your death

Cry of a restless soul

[Solo: Transcendental Protagonist]
[Solo: Equilibrian Epicurius]

Hunting breeze of wasted bliss I am
For me and you I will catch it
In the dusk of banished mist you'll hear a waning moan

Cry of a restless soul

7. Think Not Forever
[Music: Martin Furangen / Wojtek Lisicki]
[Lyrics: Maritn Furangen]

Waking up from a nameless decay
My life was is dream and my faith was in chains
Hypocrites kept me blind, still the Force is mine

Would it be in my heart to efface
Emotions for flesh and to stay out of doctrines' range
I am caught in a veil of illusions that haze my sight

If you think forever
Things will never change
When you find your sense again
You should follow its way
If you think forever
It is hard to see
When you find you truly believe
You should follow your spirit as your guide

[Solo: Trascendental Protagonist]

Evolution in mind, heart and soul
Has brought me to see and to reach to my virgin glow
I have changed how to be, but it still is me

There is no one to stop my every strife
And all of my dreams now can be lived in life
I have learned how to see and believe in me, all time

If you think forever
Things will never change
When you find your sense again
You should follow its way
If you think forever
It is hard to see
When you find you truly believe
You should follow your spirit as your guide

8. Highlander (The One)
[Music & Lyrics: Wojtek Lisicki]

He's the one, pure in his heart
Shining fair in the bliss never lost
Noble grace, innocent faith
Running throughout the fields immense
Shouting free in the air again
Dancing there with the wind

Sudden gust hit my face, burning rain tore the clouds
From depth of the gloaming thunder came

On a mountain I saw it
When lightning reached out for him
Enchanting my eyes... in magical rhapsody
On a mountain I watched him
As power filled up his veins
Surrounded by dusk
As the rain from the heavens was falling, falling...

And lone he might be on the ways of this world
His sword, sole companion, always there

On a mountain I watched him
When proudly he swung his steel
Entracing my heart... in mystical harmony
On a mountain I saw it
When knowledge aroused his sense
Encircled by clouds
In the gales now enlightened reborn

Wish I could fly through the land beloved
Not in my dream, nor by spell then bound
Paradise's here in the fields immense
Here is my life, not above!
How could I leave this place...

Wish I could fly through the land beloved
Not in my dream, nor by spell then bound
Paradise's here in the fields immense
If I return to this world here I will live again

Straightened by fury, I feel no fear
Fire inside, it keeps me awake
For no blind I ever shall bend!
This is my law! This is my way!

Hey!

Insight's my power, truth is my breath
Free in my thoughts I always remain!
Choose to take a different path
Strong in the storms, pure through the waste

Stand up, Oh brothers over the world!
Enemies are there and mostly the same
We are a kind that never gives in!
We are a flame born in the wind!

Hey!

Time's of no matter, it never was!
World is the same, just different form
Freedom is something one doesn't earn
Always your own! Graced by the will!

He's the one, pure in his heart
Shining fair in the pride never lost
Noble grace, unbroken faith
Running throughout the fields immense
Shouting free in the air embraced
Dancing there with the wind


1. Death Tone
[R. Friedman/ J. DeMaio]

Ridin' on two wheels
Chains hooked on my heels
Sittin' in leather...
Ridin' on steel
Put my shades on
Hair blows in the wind

Now he won't look again, no he won't
[PreChorus:]
Now, you were sittin' home
And I got sent to Nam

2. Metal Daze
[J. DeMaio]

I hear the sound
In a metal way
I feel the power
Rolling off the stage
Cause only one thing
Really sets me free
Heavy Metal
Loud as it can be
Baby I was born to play music
I'm a man with a screamin guitar
There's a light in the middle of the stage
In a minute I'll be wearing it all
I don't know another way of living
Baby I don't really care
Give me a pair of jeans
And a riff that's mean
And girls that love to share
[Chorus:]
Heavy metal, metal daze
Heavy metal, heavy metal daze
Heavy metal, heavy metal daze
Living like there's no tomorrow
Yeah Currie says we're on the edge
He says man you're really graphic
This band a social wedge
Yeah we all got hearts made of metal
and our blood is hot molten rock
And if I don't hear the sound of metal
I go into shock
[Chorus:]
Heavy metal, metal daze
Heavy metal, heavy metal daze
Heavy metal, heavy metal daze
Heavy metal, heavy metal daze
Heavy metal
So mister D. J.
Play just one for me
You know the one
With the crushin' and the screams
'Cause only one thing
Really sets me free
Heavy metal
Loud as it can be
[Chorus:]
Heavy metal, metal daze
Heavy metal, heavy metal daze
Heavy metal, heavy metal daze
heavy metal, heavy metal daze
Heavy metal
Loud as it can be

3. Fast Taker
[R. Friedman / J. DeMaio]

Mama's having problems,
Always comes to me
Your daddy's been a drinker since nineteen forty-three
They tell you I'm a loser
'Cause I like bein' free
The truth is in the mirror
It's what they never see

A long time ago
They tried to tell me, son
Keep our daughter home

That you should be praying
For me, a fast taker
Right here's where I'm staying
Life's a game I play for keeps,
Aaaah

Fast Taker,
Bed Breaker,
Love Maker
Take it away

You're only sixteen
A woman, not a girl
Old enough for a trip around the world

Pick you up on Friday
When your daddy goes to sleep
Bring you back on Sunday
When he's watching "Billy Graham" on T.V.
Oh yeah, he won't see me

Now do it right with the music
Then you'll learn how to use it
All night, a fast taker
Right here's where I'm staying
Life's a game I play for keeps,
Aaaah

4. Shell Shock
[R. Friedman/J. DeMaio]

I don't know
Well, there's no charge for the haircut
And the bullets come free
My Uncle Sam sent a letter, said:
He's got a mission for me
Now I'm a ranger, not a stranger
And I live in Saigon
We've got a team of special forces
And we deliver napalm
But if they tell you that I've lost my mind
Baby it's not gone just a little hard to find
By the time this letter gets home
I'd be gone, gone, yeah gone
And if they tell you that I'm M.I.A.
Think a little less about me each day
'Cause if I ever get back
I'll be shell shocked, whoa
Shell shocked, yeah
Feels funny riding in my car
Used to drive a tank and shoot a B.A.R.
I know I'm home
But I feel gone, gone, yeah gone
Now it's over and the homeland's safe
Got a purple heart to show the world I'm brave
The businessmen sat at home
Well I got shell shocked, whoa
Shell shocked, whoa
Shell shock
Shell shock
Shell shock

5. Manowar
[R. Friedman / J. DeMaio]

We met on English ground
In a backstage room
We heard the sound
And we all knew
What we had to do
We called the high command
Requested leave to make a stand
And in the field we grew
And we all knew
Soon the time would come
For us to fight,
Destination
Now in sight
Aaah, Manowar
Born to live forever more
The right to conquer every shore
Hold your ground and give no more
Our fight will never end
So we call on partisans
To raise your hands
And take our stand
Look sharp
When duty calls
Where we march
Cities fall
And the strong survive
And take our side
Now the time has come
For us to fight
Target waiting
In our sight
Aaah, Manowar
Born to live forever more
The right to conquer every shore
Hold your ground and give no more
Manowar
Born to live forever more
The right to conquer every shore
Manowar
Born to live forever more
Manowar
Born to live forever more
The right to conquer every shore
Hold your ground and give no more
Born to live forever more
The right to conquer every shore
Manowar

6. Dark Avenger
[R. Friedman / J. Demaio]

He broke the laws of the elders
So they plucked out his eye,
Took his land and fortune,
Left him to die
Bound on the shoreline,
Left for the tide,
Sees his life-blood leaving...
Circling lower, the vultures fly
His bones may be broken
But the spirit can't die
And the Gods see his anguish
And give him a sign
From the floor of the ocean
The ship of the lost souls rise
And they take him where no one sleeps while the undead cry,
Where no one sleeps while the undead cry...
And in the world above
The elders sing,
On his land they live...
Let death's bell ring

[Narration:]
He was met at the gate of Hades
By the Guardian of the Lost Souls,
The Keeper of the Unavenged
And He did say to him,
"Let ye not pass Abaddon
Return to the world
From whence you came
And seek payment
Not only for thine own anguish
But to vindicate the souls
Of the Unavenged."
And they placed in his hands
A sword
Made for him
Called Vengeance
Forged in brimstone
And tempered
By the woeful tears of the unavenged
And to carry him up on his journey
Back to the upper world
They brought forth
Their Demon horse
Called: Black Death
A grim steed
So fiersome in might
And black in colour
That he could stand as one with the darkness...
Save from his burning eyes
of crimson fire
And on that night
They rode up from Hell
The pounding of his hooves
Did clap like thunder!

[Chorus:]
Burning, death, destruction
Raping the daughters and wives
In blood I take my payment
In full with their lives
No one can escape me
On Black Death I ride
When kissed by the sword of Vengeance
Your head lays there by your side
I take the lives of all that I once knew
The torn flesh of a slow death waits for you

[Chorus:]
Burning, death, destruction
Raping the daughters and wives
In blood I take my payment
In full with their lives
I spare not land or servants
My wake is smoke and flame
I take their wives and daughters
They stand there watching, watching
Hoping to gain their lives
But when I'm through they know that they must pay

[Chorus:]
Burning, death, destruction
Raping the daughters and wives
In blood I take my payment
In full with their lives
With their lives
With their lives
With their lives

[INSTRUMENTAL]

[Rossini]

8. Battle Hymns
[R. Friedman/J. DeMaio]

By moonlight we ride
Ten thousands side by side
With swords drawn held high
Our whips and armour shine
Hail to thee our infantry
Still brave beyond the grave
All have sworn the eternal vow
The time to strike is now

[Chorus:]
Kill, kill, Oh !
Kill, kill, Oh !
Kill, kill, Oh !
Kill, kill, Oh !
Gone are the days when freedom shone
Now blood and steel meet bone
In the light of the battle's way
The sands of time will shake
How proud our soldiers stand
With mace and chain in hand
Sound the charge into glory ride
Over the top of the vanguished pride

[Chorus:]
Victory, victory, Oh !
Victory, victory, Oh !
Victory, victory, Oh !
Victory, victory, Oh !
To the battle we ride
We crossed a starlit sky
No space no time
We'll catch the wind
Strange losses, men died
We crossed a starlit sky
And still no space or time
We'll catch the wind

[Chorus:]
Kill, kill, Oh !
Kill, kill, Oh !
Kill, kill, Oh !
Kill, kill, Oh !
Sound of charge into glory ride
Over the top of the anguished pride
By moonlight we ride
Ten thousand side by side

[Chorus:]
Kill, kill, Oh !
Kill, kill, Oh !
Kill, kill, Oh !
Kill, kill, Oh !

1. Warlord
When you see me comin' flying down the road
You know I ain't afraid to lay it down
Yea got me some leather. Leather is my skin
Black'n'chrome flashin' through the town.
Some call me the WARLORD 'cause I'm a god-damn
bad machine, young'n'hungry, not too proud'n'mean
Ride, ride, ride, I'm the WARLORD of the road,
Riding, riding, riding, ain't never growin' old.
Take what I want and I go where I please
Got the world right by the balls. This world ain't
big enough to keep me down. Yea we're livin'
in a sick world. The man on the T.V. said we
got lotsa trouble overseas, well what the hell
do I care? Think they care about me?
Stop sending money send'em all a bomb.
Ride, ride, ride, I'm the WARLORD of the road,
Ridin', ridin', ridin', ain't never growin' old.
Born to live in the fast lane on a chopped up
Harley-D, smell that oil and high test gasoline.
Never got a shortage of girls to share my seat.
Well they all want to know what people say is true,
You know, get a biker started 'n he'll drive all
damn night. Well hold on honey 'cause this ride's
for a ride.
Ride, ride, ride, ride, ride, ride, ride
I'm the WARLORD of the road.
Ridin', ridin', ridin', ain't never growin' old.

2. Secret Of Steel
Atop the mountain, where the river of steel flows
Black is the forest, white was the snow.
There as children, how could children know?
One without name or number soon would show.
There stood he, on his chariot made of gold
He did reveal the trinity of secrets old.
A sceptre of iron could mercy bring.
A shield of gold, the Creator and king,
And the great sword of steel.
Sons of destiny shall wield.
Hear Wisdom's voice.
Rise, know the strength that you feel.
Hold in your heart but never reveal.
You were called by the Gods, their powers to wield.
Guard well the secret of steel.
A sceptre of iron could mercy bring.
A shield of gold, the Creator and king,
And the great sword of steel.
Sons of destiny shall wield.
Hear Wisdom's voice.
Rise, know the strength that you feel.
Hold in your heart but never reveal.
You were called by the Gods, their powers to wield.
Guard well the secret of steel.

3. Gloves Of Metal
Hear the pounding army of the night
The call of metal summons us tonight
And gather we on this site
To behold the power and the might
We wear leather, we wear spikes, we rule the night
Off with the lights, hear the screams
See the banging heads awaken to their dreams.
The sound of metal so loud it cracks the beams
Played by warriors called the Metal Kings.
A hero's welcome for those who heed the call.
We are together, we are all.
With hands high fists fill the air
Against the world we stand.
Hands high forever we'll be there,
Gloves of Metal rule tonight. Yea
A hero's welcome for those who heed the call.
We are together, we are all.
With hands high fists fill the air
Against the world we stand.
Hands high forever we'll be there,
Gloves of Metal rule tonight. Yea
Leather, Metal, Spikes and Chains
Gloves of Metal raised to show the brave.
Into the darkness march the armies of the night.
Bound by metal we live the fight.
We wear leather, we wear spikes, we rule the night
With hands high fists fill the air
Against the world we stand.
Hands high forever we'll be there,
Gloves of Metal rule tonight. Yea

4. Gates Of Valhalla
Valhalla the gods await me
Open wide thy gates embrace me.
Great hall of the battle slain
With sword in hand.
All those who stand on shore
Raise high your hands to bid a last
farewell to the Viking land.
Death's chilling wind blows through my hair
I'm now immortal, I am there
I take my place by Odin's side
Eternal army in the sky.
I point my hatchet to the wind
I guard the gates and all within
Hear my sword sing, as I ride across the sky
Sworn by the sacred blood of Odin onward ride.
Valhalla the gods await me
Open wide thy gates embrace me.
Great hall of the battle slain
With sword in hand.
Behold the kingdom of the kings
Books of spells and magic rings
Endless knowledge, endless time
I scream the final battle cry.

5. Hatred
I taste your blood as it showers from my blade
I eat your heart, from evil it was made
With heart filled hatred black blood runs through my veins.
I take your powers to the ancient ones who reign
I conquer evil, let evil know my name
Come forth ye wicked, know the gruesome pain
I am the omen, the one that cannot die
I am the flame, hatred burns inside.
My strength is hatred, torment and pain, HATRED, HATRED
With heart filled hatred black blood runs through my veins.
I crush your bones, I kill your face
I rip your flesh, I end the chase
You meet with terror, you draw the ace
I rule the world the rats that race.
My strength is hatred, torment and pain, HATRED, HATRED
With heart filled hatred black blood runs through my veins.
HATRED

6. Revelation (Death's Angel)
Above the wreckage of your mortal world I stand
Judgement passed delivered by his hand
Now clear the smoke, there the ashes stand
A fitting tribute to mortality and man.
What was written foretold in dreams,
in visions apocalypse now seen.
And all self-righteous fools who lived and blasphemed
Drink the wine of his anger
Die with the beast
Vindication, he is coming on the clouds
See his angels, hear their trumpets sound.
The day of anger when the stars fall from the sky
The moon turns red, the sun turns black as night.
Know the end is coming, heed this sign
By the morning star the four horsemen ride.
Revelation, the chosen saved
Earth be cleansed in a blaze
Armageddon, the first trumpet blows
Hail, fire and blood fall on Satan's throne.
His hair as white as wool, his eyes like burning flame
He is the first and last, he brings the seven plagues
Seven stars of seven cities in his hand
He holds the keys of death for the underworld and man
Know the end is coming, heed this sign
By the morning star he four horsemen ride
Revelation, the chosen saved
Earth be cleansed in a blaze
Armageddon, the first trumpet blows
Hail, fire and blood fall on Satan's throne.
Revelation, the chosen saved
Earth be cleansed in a blaze
Armageddon, the first trumpet blows
Hail, fire and blood fall on Satan's throne.

7. March For Revenge (By The Soldiers Of Death)
Ride, Ride, Ride, Ride Up From Hell
Armed with magic sons of demons and men
This song of greeting written for your tragic end.
So long our stride the world doth tremble with fear
Black winds blow where we ride near.
Maim and kill them, take the women and children.
Hot pitch and chain take to the air
Our ramming blades lay their ships hold bare.
Steel meets steel, axes, broadsword and shield.
Their heads ride our spears and bodies cover the fields.
Maim and kill them, take the women and children.
Fallen brother as I hold closed your side
I fear this wound your last.
Mighty earth now doth drink your blood
And I remember days long past.
Your sacrifice so great, rest now take thy sleep
For you shall not awake, let revenge be sweet.
For when we march, your sword rides with me.
For when we march, your sword rides with me.
For when we march, your sword rides with me.
For when we march, your sword rides with me.
You who killed my brother and all who take your side
This be your last hour. Let your steel be tried.
Now turn to face me upon the timeless plane
Kill me if you can.
Death is life!
By the full moon they rise from their graves.
Through seas of blood, fighting with hell bent rage.
Swear the creed of unity, by the circle of blood
We are one, we know not fear! Born to fight not run.
Maim and kill them, take the women and children.

1. Blood Of My Enemies
Three sons have I, and they
Ride by my side. The fierce,
The black, and the wicked are
their names-we ride down my
enemies on their half-hearted flight.
No voice of mercy-no evangels of light.

Mighty messengers-heathens rage
Witness our coming-gods of the dead.
I ride through the air-
I laugh as I die-with powers of evel
Dark knowledge is mine.
The ride of the wicked-
The firstst sin was trust.-
Kill without warning-for blood now
I lust

Strong wind-magic mist
To Asgard the Valkries fly
High overhead-they carry the dead
Where blood of my enemies lies.

Three sons have I,and they
Ride by my side.-The fierce,
The  black,and the wicked are
their names-we ride down my
enemies on their half-hearted flight.
No voice of mercy-no evangels of light.

Strong wind-magic mist
To Asgard the Valkries fly
High overhead-they carry the dead
Where blood of my enemies lies.

2. Each Dawn I Die
Passing through the storm-
Led by Demons-walk between the
World of men and gods-
Cast no shadows-draw no light.
I rape the priestess on pagans night.

I taste the serpents poison
On the lips of the one I love.
She brings this gift of witchcraft.
I wear the cat-skin-gloves.

Apples of youth when I wrought
Mischief,hung in a tree to rot
In the sun.-
Reborn in the middle of the
Final orgy the gift of slavery
To the chosen one.

Suicide Suicide don't you know
Me-call to the Master-he will
Come.-He will bring out
Ressurection-cloaked in darkness-
He has won.

Smoke of my sacrifice.-
Journey to the Isle of the
Blessed.-
Grant my soul your glory.
At night time-I'm your guest.
Only I know why-

Each dawn I die.

Smoke of my sacrifice.-
Journey to the Isle of the
Blessed.-
Grant my soul your glory.
At night time-I'm your guest.
Only I know why-

3. Kill With Power
Hear what's written on the wind.
We come to kill and kill again.
Our arrows fall like hail
Trample on the dead-Ride through the
Gate of clouds-stand on the open step

Run berserk-spreading fear and pain
Black shield and weapons, black our chain.
None can harm us-not their fire-
Iron or steel-for we have the
Will to power-with power we will
Kill

Kill with power-die die
Kill with power-die die

To the war god Odin you will pray
And the curse of weapons shell
Remain.On the blood of all our
Fathers-on their weapons we now
Swear to evenge-not lament.
Give the False ones death.

Kill with power-die die

5. Army Of The Immortals
Battle hymns did sound the call.
You came to our side.
You heard true metal
Into glory ride.
Come on yea

You stood beside us,
The false ones cries.
Your love is judgment,
You gave us life.
You wait in the rain, you walk through the snow.
We give you our blood, we want you to know.

In our eyes you're immortal
In our hearts you'll live forever
In our eyes you're immortal
In our hearts you'll live forever more.

We have read your letters, we have heard your call.
We were brought together 'cause we've got the balls
To play the loudest metal, so hard and wild and mean.
You'll live forever, we were born from your belief.

Metal makes us strong
Together we belong
Forever here's your song

We want you to know

In our eyes you're immortal
In our hearts you'll live forever
In our eyes you're immortal
In our hearts you'll live forever more

Metal makes us strong
Together we belong
Forever here's your song

We want you to know

In our eyes you're immortal
In our hearts you'll live forever
In our eyes you're immortal
In our hearts you'll live forever more

Metal makes us strong
It makes us
Metal makes us strong
It makes us stronger, stronger, stronger, stronger...
Stronger, metal makes us strong

6. Black Arrows
[spoken part:]
Let each note I now play
be a black arrow of death
sent straight to the hearts
of all those who play false metal

AH

[Instrumental]

7. Bridge Of Death
Slowly crossing as the river runs below
Never stopping for whats waiting soon will slow
And this last time looking back I'll see
My home for he awaits me reaching for my
soul.He calls my name,and waves me on
The fallen one he stands in flame

Well the life that he has given full of riches
And success has a price that I made good in
Blood to pay.And the light he now is showing
To guide my every footstep is insurance if
I falter on my way.And what God has now
Forsaken and man has never seen are the
Riches of the underworld below all my
Years of earthly pleasures gave support
Unto the briges I now cross it giving
Him my soul

Dark Lord,I summon thee demanging the
Sucred right to burn in hell,ride up to hells
hot wind.Face one more evilthan thou,take
My lustful soul,
Drink my blood as I drink yours,impale me on
the horns of death
Cut off my head release all my evel Lucifer is king
Praise Satan

I know the one who waits satan is
His name,is across the bridge of
Death there he stands in flame
I know the one who waits satan is
His name,is across the bridge of
Death there he stands in flame.

He is my provider as I walk into the
Void for eternity I give to him my soul
I shall do his bidding obey him
Without question even walk among the living if
I'm told

Satan don't forsake me I wait for
You take me grant me wings and as
You messenger I'll fly.

1. All Men Play On Ten
I made a rock-n-roll sin
When I tried giving in, to make money had to turn down loud
They said, "Why be proud, don't play so loud
Be like us and get a sound that's real thin
Wear a polyester suit, act happy, look cute, get a haircut
And buy small gear"
That's when I turned to them and said, hold it, right there

Well it's more to me than just a job, and while I'm playing
You won't get robbed
Nobody tells a man how to play, it just ain't that way
Hey, hey, hey, can you hear me say

All men play on ten, never gonna turn down again
All men play on ten, never gonna turn down again

I'm jet fuel honey, plug me in to 220, step back and let
My fingers fly
While I'm burning up my gear, there's a fire in your ear
That's won't stop until the day you die
I really put it to the floor when I hear the crowd roar
Oh, it's music to my ears when they scream
Then! Run back the power jack, and deck, all of my gear

Well it's more to me than just a job, and while I'm playing
You won't get robbed
Nobody tells a man how to play, it just ain't that way
Hey, hey, hey, can you hear me say

All men play on ten, never gonna turn down again
All men play on ten, never gonna turn down again

Well it's more to me than just a job, and while I'm playing
You won't get robbed
Nobody tells a man how to play, it just ain't that way
Hey, hey, hey, can you hear me say

All men play on ten, never gonna turn down again
All men play on ten, never gonna turn down again

2. Animals
Hear the call of the wild in us all
It waits for the night to fall
I'm getting hot, I'm ready for the night
No holdin' back, let's ball
I'm gonna give all you can take all night
And leave you in the morning feeling right

I'm an animal, there's an animal in me
Gonna set it free
I'm an animal, there's an animal in me
Gonna set it free

I've been looking, you've been watching the side
There's somethings you just can't hide
Oh, your getting wet, your working up a sweat
Your hairs standing up on end
Your skin is screaming, glad we met?
Tonight's one night you won't forget

I'm an animal, there's an animal in me
Gonna set it free
I'm an animal, there's an animal in me
Gonna set it free

3. Thor (The Powerhead)
Black clouds on the horizon
Great thunder and burning rain
His chariot pounding, I heard the heavens scream his name

I watched as he shouted
To the giants that died that day
He held up his hammer high and called Odin for a sign

Thor the mighty, Thor the brave
Crush the infidels in your way
By your hammer let none be saved
Live to die on that final day
Gods, monsters and men
We'll die together in the end

God of thunder, God of rain
Earth shaker who feels no pain
The powerhead of the universe
Now send your never ending curse

I watched as he shouted
To the giants that died that day
He held up his hammer high and called Odin for a sign

Thor the mighty, Thor the brave
Crush the infidels in your way
By your hammer let none be saved
Live to die on that final day
Gods, monsters and men
We'll die together in the end

Swing your hammer to crack the sky
Lift your cape so that you might fly
Back to Odin and gods on high
And leave this mortal world

Thor the mighty, Thor the brave
Crush the infidels in your way
By your hammer let none be saved
Live to die on that final day
Gods, monsters and men
We'll die together in the end
Odin

4. Mountains
So tall, silent against the sky
Up through the clouds, where eagles fly
Wind and rain beat down on one so strong
They cut but never change, what stood so long

Tall  as a mountain, I'm gonna tear through the sky
Life's for the taking
Like a man is a mountainside
Greatness waits for those who try
None can teach you, it's all inside
Just climb

I'm in the ground, I'm in the air, I'm all
I live in the hearts of all men
I'm the call to greatness
Not all can hear
I awaken the creator, in those who dare
And the day will come, when we all must die
And enter the mountainside

Tall as a mountain, I'm gonna tear through the sky
Life's for the taking
Like a man is a mountainside
Greatness waits for those who try
None can teach you, it's all inside
Just climb

I have no fear
Death and glory
Both draw near
Like a man is a mountainside
Greatness waits for those who try
None can teach you, it's all inside
Just climb

5. Sign Of The Hammer
The spell has been broken, the curse has been lifted
Black is the wind on the heels of the gifted
Four sworn to vengeance, see the hate in our eyes
Called by the gods and given a sign

Onward pounding into glory ride
Sign of the hammer, be my guide
Final warning all stand aside
Sign of the hammer, it's my time

Pounding, pounding, we are back from the dead
Those who denied us are delivered instead
Into the hands of four sworn to ride
Now the people will triumph and live by the sign

Onward pounding into glory ride
Sign of the hammer, be my guide
Final warning all stand aside
Sign of the hammer, it's my time

The spell has been broken, the curse has been lifted
Black is the wind on the heels of the gifted
Four sworn to vengeance, see the hate in our eyes
Called by the gods and given a sign

Onward pounding into glory ride
Sign of the hammer, be my guide
Final warning all stand aside
Old man and young boys, it's my time
Sign of the hammer, it's my time

6. The Oath
Burning embers of the second death will come in the night
Priests and kings, the alpha and omega, poison bites
False prophets and deceivers, swing from the trees
Now dawn the age of birds
Drunk with blood, like lepers with disease

Lord of the sky, mercury the guide
Lord of the underworld, I swear the sacred rite
I will crucify, slay them with their tribe
Hear my war cry

They'll find no sanctuary hidden in their ancestral halls
Let loose the knot that binds
The spirit and flesh, let it fall
For only courage and heroism linger after death
So, hold fast thy sword, rejecting pain, feel the dragons breath

Lord of the sky, mercury the guide
Lord of the underworld, I swear the sacred rite
I will crucify, slay them with their tribe
Hear my war cry

I've sworn the oath
I've sworn the oath
I've sworn the oath

Lord of the sky, mercury the guide
Lord of the underworld, I swear the sacred rite
I will crucify, slay them with their tribe
Hear my war cry

Burning embers of the second death will come in the night
Priests and kings, the alpha and omega, poison bites
False prophets and deceivers, swing from the trees
Now dawn the age of birds
Drunk with blood, like lepers with disease

Lord of the sky, mercury the guide
Lord of the underworld, I swear the sacred rite
I will crucify, slay them with their tribe
Hear my war cry

I've sworn the oath
I've sworn the oath
I've sworn the oath

7. Guyana (Cult Of The Damned)
Thank you for the kool aid reverend jim
We're glad to leave behind their world of sin
Our lifeless bodies fall on holy ground
Rotting flesh a sacrificial mound

Were you our God or a man in a play who took our applause and forced us to stay
Now all together we lived as we dead on your command by your side

Guyana – in the cult of the damned
Give us your word for the grand final stand
Guyana – in the cult of the damned
Give us your word for the grand final stand

In the cult of the damned we all worked the land, too afraid to look up
We all feared his hand
Hurry my children
There isn't much time
But we'll meet again on the other side
Be good to the children and old people
First hand them a drink
They're dying of thirst

Guyana – in the cult of the damned
Give us your word for the grand final stand
Guyana – in the cult of the damned
Give us your word for the grand final stand
Guyana – in the cult of the damned
Give us your word for the grand final stand
Guyana – in the cult of the damned
Give us your word for the grand final stand

Bigfoot, bigfoot thrown in a well
Pulled under water
Screaming like hell
He told us life was just a hotel
Time to check out when he rang the bell

Guyana – in the cult of the damned
Give us your word for the grand final stand
Guyana – in the cult of the damned
Give us your word for the grand final stand
Mother, mother.

1. Achilles, Agony, And Ecstasy (In Eight Parts)
[PRELUDE]

[I HECTOR STORMS THE WALL]

I see my chariot run to your ships
I'll drive you back to the sea
You came here for gold
The wall will not hold
This day was promised to me
The gods are my shield
My fate has been sealed
Lightning and javelins fly
Soon many will fall
We are storming the wall
Stones fall snow from the sky
We will pay with our glory
In the fire of battle
Zeus today is mine
Killing all my way
Like sheep and like cattle
Smashing skulls of all who defy
I spare not the hammer
I spare not the sword
This day will ring with my name
None have to chase me
Let he who will face me
Kill me or die by the sword

[II THE DEATH OF PATROCLUS]

Oh friend of mine, how to say goodbye
This was your time, but the armor you wore
Was mine, I will not rest
Until Hector's blood is spilled
His bones will all be broken
Dragged across the field
This dear friend is how we'll say goodbye
Until we meet in the sky

[III FUNERAL MARCH]

[IV ARMOR OF THE GODS]

[V HECTOR'S FINAL HOUR]

Here is inside the walls Troy, the gods weigh my fate
From this day do I abstain, to a memory of hate
To pay for all the blood that spilled
The many thousands I did kill,
No walls can contain the gods' almighty will
I hear the silent voices I cannot hide
The gods leaves no choices so we all must die
Oh Achilles let thy arrows fly.
Into the wind, where eagles cross the sky
Today my mortal blood will mix with sand
It was foretold I will die by thy hand
Into Hades my soul descend

[VI DEATH HECTOR'S REWARD]

Cowards in the grip of fear, no valour to uphold
Cut into the earth, with honor long been sold
For all shall come to know me
As they fall unto their knees
Zeus the Thunderer, control my destiny
When the cards of life were dealt,
My hand a ruthless fate
To avenge, and bringeth fury, Hector feel my hate
A bloodbath was born to bring, by birth I'm an assassin
To cut the cord of life and beath,
Ties to earth unfasten
Blood and fire death and hate, your body I will desecrate
Dogs and vultures eat your flesh the hall of Hades waits
Kill...
Hector's blood lies on the battlefield
His body lies on the battlefield
His body's mangled wounds,
The gods who once protected him are now his gods of doom,
Like a tower standing tall, steadfest in direction
I fall upon you bringing death, the gods give no protection
Coward in the grip of fear, no valour to uphold
Cut into the earth, with honor long been sold
For all shall come to know me, as they fall ino their knees
Zeus the Thunderer, control my destiny
Blood and fire death and hate, you body I will desecrate
Dogs and vultures eat your flesh the hall of Hades waits
Die, die, die...

[VII THE DESECRATION OF HECTOR'S BODY]
[PART 1]
[PART 2]

[VIII THE GLORY OF ACHILLES]

The oath of the gods, this day was fulfilled
In the heat of the battle, Hector was killed
See him Patroclus, down in the dust
Rejoice in his death my symbol of trust
A dozen highborn youths, have been killed
Cutting their throats their blood was all spilled
Their bodies set at the fool of your fire
With oxen, sheep and two of your hounds
Your funeral pyre high off the ground
Hector's body dragged three times around
I will carry the torch to your funeral pyre
I will ask of the wind to send high your fire
Hector's blood will not be washed from my body until your body is burned
A prophecy spoken a promice fulfilled
More blood will be spilled, more will be killed.

2. Metal Warriors (Brothers Of Metal Pt. I)
Every one of us has heard the call
Brothers of True Metal proud and standing tall
We know the power within us has brought us to this hall
There's magic in the metal there's magic is us all

Heavy metal or no metal at all wimps and posers leave the hall
Heavy metal or no metal at all wimps and posers go on get out
Leave the hall

Now the world must listen to our decree
We don't turn down for anyone we do just what we please
Got to make it louder, all men play on ten
If you're not into metal, you are not my friend

Heavy metal or no metal at all wimps and posers leave the hall
Heavy metal or no metal at all wimps and posers I said
Leave the hall

Now the world must listen to our decree
We don't turn down for anyone we do just what we please
Got to make it louder, all men play on ten
If you're not into metal, you are not my friend

There's metal in the air tonight, can you hear it call
If you ain't got the balls, to take it you can
Leave the hall

Heavy metal or no metal at all wimps and posers leave the hall
Heavy metal or no metal at all wimps and posers leave the hall

3. Ride The Dragon
Demon's blood and dragon fire, falling on my wings
Racing to the battle in the sky
Ancient gods are calling me I hear them when they sing
Of all the heroes who wait for me to die

Beneath the cloak of magic, I'll meet them in the air
I am invisible, I move without a sound
They look but cannot find me, they think that I'm not there
With a spell I send them crashing to the ground

Wait for me dragon, we'll meet in the sky by fire and magic I am sworn
Hell is calling! We cannot be denied fly to the blackness of the storm
We must die to be reborn

I wear a sacred talisman, I make a secret sign
Now welcome me into this wicked wind
On the journey of a shaman a dragon I must ride
The gates of hell are open! Let me in!

Rule in hell or serve in heaven choose an altar or throne
All Commandments and the laws of man disown
Now eat the fruit of knowledge unto no one ye atone
Into the fire with your soul!

Wait for me dragon, we'll meet in the sky by fire and magic I am sworn
Hell is calling! We cannot be denied fly to the blackness of the storm
We must die to be reborn

Demon's blood and dragon fire, falling on my wings Racing to the battle in the sky
Ancient gods are calling me I hear them when they sing
Of all the heroes who wait for me to die

Beneath the cloak of magic, I'll meet them in the air
I am invisible, I move without a sound
They look but cannot find me, they think that I'm not there
With a spell I send them crashing to the ground

Wait for me dragon, we'll meet in the sky by fire and magic I am sworn
Hell is calling! We cannot be denied fly to the blackness of the storm
We must die to be reborn

4. Spirit Horse Of The Cherokee
The trail of tears began for all the Cherokee
The white men came to trade & borrow but then they would not leave
Some of us were taken by boat, and died at sea
Those of us who lived were sold to slavery

We welcomed them as brothers knowing nothing of their greed
Born hunters not the hunted as the white man hunts for me
We are descendants of the animals we live among the free
Our trail of tears would end one day at Wounded Knee.

Great Spirit, thunder birds fly, we are wild and free
To fight and die by the open sky, Spirit Horse ride for me

When we do the Ghost Dance, the buffalo will return
Paint ourselves for war, now blood and fire burn
Great Spirit makes us strong, take us to the sky
The Cherokee are brave, we are not afraid to die

Great Spirit, thunder birds fly, we are wild and free
To fight and die by the open sky, Spirit Horse ride for me

Red Cloud, Black Hawk, Sitting Bull, Crazy Horse, Geronimo
Strong and brave warriors to the grave

There has been much killing there will be much more
The Medicine Man is dancing he's calling us to war,
Hatchets sing with pride let the white men die

Great Spirit, thunder birds fly, we are wild and free
To fight and die by the open sky, Spirit Horse ride for me

5. Burning
We have come from the ashes of the burning away
Pouring blood in the fire on the altar of pain
Led into temptation, now the black gods align
Here there is no salvation and your blood is my wine.

Here's a world that is waiting between the living and the dead
Here the flesh and its pleasure are eternally wed
All is all for the taking for a life of a lie
At the end of the breaking I'll be watching you die.

Crawl to the silence renounce and deny,
The stars and the numbers foretold of this time,
To the words and the wisdom too the promise of lies
By their anger and fury the strong will survive.

6. The Power Of Thy Sword
Lord of battle I pray on bended knee conquest by the rising sun
I'll wait for thy command with flame and blood at hand
glory and a broken sword.

I'm the master of the world I have no fear of man or beast
Born inside the soul of the world
Riding hard breaking bone with steel and stone
Eternal might I was born to wield.

Let us drink to the battles we've lived and we've fought
Celebrate the pain and havoc we have wrought
Great heroes charge into the fight
From the north to the south in the black of night

The clash of honor calls to stand when others fall
Gods of war feel the power of my sword

Drink to the battles we've lived and we've fought
Celebrate the pain and havoc we have wrought
Great heroes charge into the fight
From the north to the south in the black of night

Fierce is my blade fierce is my hate born to die in battle
I laugh at my fate
Now pay in blood when your blood has been spilled
You're never forgiven death is fulfilled !

The clash of honor calls to stand when others fall
Gods of war feel the power of my sword

The clash of honor calls
I will stand when others fall
Open magic doors
The will know the power of my sword

There is blood in my hands there is blood in my eyes
With blood in my voice I scream as you die
Thirsting for vengeance and mounds of the slain
Shaking the forest onto the plain

Fierce is my blade fierce is my hate born to die in battle
I laugh at my fate
Now pay in blood when your blood has been spilled
You're never forgiven death is fulfilled !

The clash of honor calls to stand when others fall
Gods of war feel the power of my sword

7. The Demon's Whip
Black candles slowly burning, white fangs and flashing eyes
Hell's wind and incantations summon living fire,
Darkest forces and your demon's black order, black king
The cult that serves the living, accept this offering

Black candles slowly burning, white fangs and flashing eyes
Hell's wind and incantations summon living fire,
As the seven steps await, hear the great bell toll
With a dead man's bones conjure, the enemy of the soul

From the misery and sadness, of the molten seas of hell
Mystic love and mystic symbols in evil dreams there dwell
Darkest forces and your demon's black order, black king
The cult that serves the living, accept this offering

A deadly drink, a meal of hearts, now sacrifice and die
In darkness and destruction, behold the evil eye
And the Demon's whip

Armies of the gods of hell ride across the astral plane
Bearing curses of destruction, sworn beyond the grave
Children of the darkness, all born but to deceive
By the ancient code of evil grant not one reprieve

In the place where evil dwells death can live when all life dies
Wage eternal war on heaven immortal hate below the sky
Your scripture and your sermons, are leaves born on the wind
To heal the unrepentant one needs a greater sin

Night winds, Oblivion see my dark desire
Come forth, appear he is living fire
Feel the Demon's whip

Armies of the gods of hell ride across the astral plane
Bearing curses of destruction, sworn beyond the grave
Children of the darkness, all born but to deceive
By the ancient code of evil grant not one reprieve

In the place where evil dwells death can live when all life dies
Wage eternal war on heaven immortal hate below the sky
Your scripture and your sermons, are leaves borne on the wind
To heal the unrepentant one needs a greater sin
Feel the Demon's whip

8. Master Of The Wind
In the silence of the darkness when all are fast asleep
I live inside a dream calling to your spirit
As a sail calls the wind, hear the angels sing

Far beyond the sun across the western sky
Reach into the blackness find a silver line
In a voice I whisper a candle in the night
We'll carry all our dreams in a single beam of light

Close your eyes, look into the dream
Winds of change will winds of fortune bring

Fly away to a rainbow in the sky gold is at the end for each of us to find
There the road begins where another one will end
Here the four winds know who will break and who will bend
All to be the master of the wind

Falling stars now light my way
My life was written on the wind
Clouds above, clouds below
High ascend the dreams within

When the wind fills the sky the clouds will move aside
And there will be the road to all our dreams
For any day that stings two better days it brings

Nothing is as bad as it seems
Close your eyes, look into the dream
Wins of change will winds of fortune bring

Fly away to a rainbow in the sky gold is at the end for each of us to find
There the road begins where another one will end
Here the four winds know who will break and who will bend
All to be the master of the wind

1. Fighting The World

I'm fighting for Metal 'cause it's here to stay

3. Carry On
The north star always guides me
When winter skies are gray
And I wait for the sun when all ate one
I shall not betray
Calling at me
I'm waiting when all are led astray

Carry On my sons forever
Carry On when I am gone
Carry On for when the day is long
Forever Carry On
For as long as we together
Then forever Carry On

Darkness all around us
We don't close our eyes
No one's gonna ground us
We were born to fly
Comin' at us no stopping
Born to amplify

Carry On my sons forever
Carry On when I am gone
Carry On for when the day is long
Forever Carry On
For as long as we together
Then forever Carry On

Yea, be my brother
Fight to stay alive
All the world can't change us
With all their burned-out jive
Come get us now we're waiting
We won't ride and hide

Carry On my sons forever
Carry On when I am gone
Carry On for when the day is long
Forever Carry On
For as long as we together
Then forever Carry On

Now we're all together
Let's sing a fighting song
One hundred thousand riders
We can't all be wrong
Comin' at us no stopping
Always Carry On

Carry On my sons forever
Carry On when I am gone
Carry On for when the day is long
Forever Carry On
For as long as we together
Then forever Carry On

4. Violence And Bloodshed
Civilization crumblin' fast
End the world with a blast
People afraid walkin' the streets
Scums have their day
'Til they run into me

Are you ready ?

Livin' in fear ain't livin to me
I'm armed with a gun defending the free
They blew it in 'Nam
Shot up my friends
I'm back in the street
The fight never ends
I was born with a gun in my hand
I'll die for my country
But I'll die like a man

Violence and Bloodshed
Violence and Bloodshed
Violence and Bloodshed

Now that we're back to animal law
The payback's a bitch
I'm paying all
All my life I been waitin' to see
Who's gonna win, crumbs or me

Are you ready ?

My brother's still in Da-Nang
Puttin' an ad in the back of Kerrang
I'm lookin' for people who just wanna kill
We'll go back to 'Nam 'cause no one else win

Land of the free
Home of the brave
Now that's how it is
And that's how it stays

Violence and Bloodshed
Violence and Bloodshed
Violence and Bloodshed

5. Defender
When you are old enough to read these words
Their meaning will unfold
These words are all that's left
And though we've never met, my only son
I hope you know
That I would have been there to watch you grow
But my call was heard and I did go
Now your mission lies ahead of you
As it did my so long ago
To help the helpless ones who all look up to you
And to defend them to the end

Defender

Ride like the wind
Fight proud, my son
You're the defender
God has sent

Father,father,father
I look up to you and heed thy call

This letter ends my search
I'll live your dream now passed on to me
And I now wait to shake the hand of fate
Like the dusk awaiting dawn
So wizards cast your spell
With no heart to do me well
So it is written, it shall be

Defender

Ride like the wind
Fight proud, my son
You're the defender
God has sent

Vast legions all immortal
Smash the stillness everywhere

Bless this ground, our holy land

9. Black Wind, Fire And Steel
Full moon's light is calling me
My kingdom lies within
The mystic soul and lion's heart
Brought by the talisman.
The ecstasy of battle takes me
Where the falcons fly.
Immortal youth was granted me
I will never die.

Born of Black Wind, Fire and Steel
Born of Black Wind, Fire and Steel
Born to teach them all to heel
Black Wind, Fire and Steel.

Pounded by the hammers
Of the giants of the world.
I can see in darkness,
I'm the overlord
Single combat I await
My shadow brings them fear.
The spikes upon my chariot
Will grind them when they're near.

Born of Black Wind, Fire and Steel
Born of Black Wind, Fire and Steel
Born to teach them all to heel
Black Wind, Fire and Steel.

I am an outcast
On the path of no return.
Punisher and swordsman
I was born to burn.
Black Wind always follows
Where my black horse rides.
Fire's in my soul
Steel is on my side.

Born of Black Wind, Fire and Steel

Since the dawn of time
I've rolled across the earth
Snipping in the dust
Long before your birth
Eatin'tar and gasoline
Every light I see is green
Open pipes, my machines's triple-plated chrome

Spirit of the wheel

Wheels of fire burn the night
Ride across the sky
Wheels of fire burning bright
We live to ride

Motors running
Now you're gonna learn
Waiting on the line
Make your tires burn
Fast, faster, faster, faster
Speeding always kills
Nothing else takes us to get these thrills

Spirit of the wheel

Wheels of fire burn the night
Ride across the sky
Wheels of fire burning bright
We live to ride

Blood and thunder on the road
My heart is pounding
My blood is nitroglycerin
I'm fire
Burning, burning, burning, burning
Ready to explode
Don't want nothing left of me to scrape off the road

Spirit of the wheel

Wheels of fire burn the night
Ride across the sky
Wheels of fire burning bright
We live to ride

Clouds of smoke
Tires screaming
Fire in my hair
blown into a thousand pieces
Scattered everywhere
Fast, burn, burning, faster
Wanna take a ride
Spirit of the wheel
Wheels of fire ride
Spirit of the wheel

Wheels of fire burn the night
Ride across the sky
Wheels of fire burning bright
We live to ride

2. Kings Of Metal
[Joey DeMaio,Ross The Boss]

Manowar Manowar living on the road
When we're in town speakers explode
We don't attract wimps 'cause we're too loud
Just true metal people that's Manowar's crowd

They wanna keep us down
But they can't last
When we get up we're gonna kick your ass
Gonna keep on burnin'
We always will
Other bands play Manowar kill
Other bands play Manowar kill

We like it hard, we like it fast
We got the biggest amps, man they blast
True metal people wanna rock not pose
Wearin' jeans and leather, not cracker jack clothes

They wanna keep us down
But they can't last
When we get up we're gonna kick your ass
Gonna keep on burnin'
We always will
Other bands play Manowar kill
Other bands play Manowar kill

We're the kings of metal comin' to town
When we light up, have the roof nailed down
Don't try to tell us that we're too loud
'Cause there ain't no way that we'll ever turn down

They wanna keep us down
But they can't last
When we get up we're gonna kick your ass
Gonna keep on burnin'
We always will
other bands play Manowar kill

3. Heart Of Steel
[Joey DeMaio]

Build a fire a thousand miles away to light my long way home
I ride a comet
My trail is long to stay
Silence is a heavy stone...
I fight the world and take all they can give
There are times my heart hangs low
Born to walk against the wind
Born to hear my name
No matter where I stand I'm alone

Stand and fight
Live by your heart
Always one more try
I'm not afraid to die
Stand and fight
say what you feel
Born with a heart of steel

Burn the bridge behind you
Leave no retreat
There's only one way home
Those who laugh and crowd the path
And cut each other's throats
Will fall like melting snow
They'll watch us rise with fire in our eyes
They'll bow their heads
Their hearts will hang low
Then we'll laugh and they will kneel
And know this heart of steel was
Too hard to break
Too hard to hold

Stand and fight
Live by your heart
Always one more try
I'm not afraid to die
Stand and fight
Say what you feel
born with a heart of steel

5. The Crown And The Ring (Lament Of The Kings)
[Joey DeMaio]

From a battle I've come
To a battle I ride
Blazing up to the sky
Chains of fate
Hold a fiery stride
I'll see you again when I die

High and mighty alone we are kings
Whirlwinds of fire we ride
Providence brought us the crown and the ring
Covered with blood and our pride

Heroes await me
My enemies ride fast
Knowing not this ride's their last
Saddle my horse as I drink my last ale
Bow string and steel will prevail

High and mighty alone we are kings
Whirlwinds of fire we ride
Providence brought us the crown and the ring
Covered with blood and our pride

Odin I await thee
Your true son am I
I hail you now as I die
I pledge you my sword and to no man I kneel
Ours is the Kingdom Of Steel

High and mighty alone we are kings
Whirlwinds of fire we ride
Providence brought us the crown and the ring
Covered with blood and our pride

6. Kingdom Come
[Joey DeMaio]

See the white light
The light within
Be your own disciple
Fan the sparks of will
For all of us waiting
Our kingdom will come
Rays of power shining
Rays of magic fall
On the golden voice that speaks within us all
For all of us waiting
Your kingdom will come
Kingdom Come

Feel the white light
The light within
Yea it burns a fire that drives a man to win
For all of us waiting
Your kingdom will come

Kingdom Come

Words of power
Calling to us all
Holding us together while other kingdoms fall
No longer waiting
Our kingdom has come

Kingdom Come

Kingdom coming
Another kingdom falls
The rightful are waiting
But all are not rightful
Wait and receive the weight of the fall

Kingdom Come

7. Hail And Kill
[Joey DeMaio,Ross The Boss]

Brothers I am calling from the valley of the kings
With nothing to atone
A dark march lies ahead, together we will ride
Like thunder from the sky
May your sword stay wet like a young girl in her prime
Hold your hammers high

Blood and death are waiting like a raven in the sky
I was born to die
Hear me while I live
As I look into your eyes
None shall hear a lie
Power and dominion are taken by the will
By divine right hail and kill

Hail, Hail, Hail, Hail and Kill, Hail and Kill
Hail, Hail, Hail, Hail and Kill, Hail and Kill

My father was a wolf
I'm a kinsman of the slain
Sworn to rise again
I will bring salvation, punishment and pain
The hammer of hate is our faith
Power and dominion are taken by the will
By divine right hail and kill
Hail, Hail, Hail, Hail and Kill, Hail and Kill
Hail, Hail, Hail, Hail and Kill, Hail and Kill

Rip their flesh
Burn their hearts
Stab them in the eyes
Rape their women as they cry
Kill their servants
Burn their homes
Till there's no blood left to spill
Hail and Kill
Power and dominion are taken by the will
By divine right hail and kill

Hail, Hail, Hail, Hail and Kill, Hail and Kill

8. The Warriors Prayer
- Grandfather, tell me a story !
- Alright, go and get your storybook
- No, no, not one of those, a real story !
- A real story ?
- Yes, tell me about when you were a boy.
- Well, then I shall have to take you back
with me, a long way in time...

It was my thirteenth year on a cold winter's
day, as I walked through the enchanted forest,
I heard the sound of horses and men at arms,
I felt compelled to walk on and find the place
of these sounds, and when the forest did clear
I was standing on a hill. Before me, (there?)
was a great plain. Upon it, the armies of the
world, standing, waiting. I thought to myself,
for whom or for what are they waiting ?
Suddenly a gust of wind came up from the north.
There appeared a lone rider, holding a sword
of steel. Then from the south came another,
bearing a battle ax. From the east came a third,
holding a spiked club. And finally, from the west,
a rider who wielded a great hammer of war.
With them came their soldiers of death, followed
by an army of immortals. They were few in number,
but the look in their eyes told all who beheld
them that they would leave this day only in
victory or death. And there was a great silence...

My heart began to pound, storm clouds filled
the sky with darkness, rain came, and the four
winds blew with such anger that I held fast to
a tree. I watched the four riders raise their
weapons into the air. Without warning, screaming
their war cry. They led the attack, down to
the battle they rode. They met the armies of
the world with a mighty clash ! I could feel
the ground shake, the earth drank much blood
that day ! Each of the four, was unto himself,
a whirlwind of doom !!!!!!!!!!
When the smoke did clear, many thousands
were dead. There was much blood and gore.
Their bodies lay broken and scattered across
the battlefield, like brown leaves blown by
the wind. And I saw the four ride together
to the top of the hill, while below them the
soldiers of death assembled, all those who
would now swear allegiance to them. And the
four spoke the words of the warriors prayer...

Gods of war I call You. My sword is by my side.
I seek a life of honor, free from all false pride.
I will crack the whip with a bold mighty hail.
Cover me with death if I should ever fail.

Glory, Majesty, Unity
Hail, Hail, Hail

And as I stood and looked on, I heard the
armies of the world hail them without end, and
their voices of victory carried long and far
throughout the land !

- Well that's it. Did you like the story ?
- Yeah, it was great !
- Oh Good, I'm glad. Now off to bed with you.
- Grandfather ?
- Yes ?
- Who were those four men ?
- Who were they ? They were the Metal Kings !!!!!!

10. Pleasure Slave
[bonus track]

She Is Waiting To Kiss My Hand
But She Will Wait For My Command
My Chains And Collar Brought Her To Her Knees
She Now Is Free To Please
Woman Be My Slave
That's Your Reason To Live

12. Herz Aus Stahl
[German version of "Heart Of Steel" off the album "Kings Of Metal"]

Ein Feuer brennt
1000 Meilen weg,
Zeig mir den Weg zum Ziel.

Ich reit' Kometen,
Mein Weg ist lang und schwer,
Schweigen ist die schwerste Last.

Kaempf gegen die Welt,
Nimm alles, was es gibt,
Manchmal verlier auch ich.

Geboren um gegen den Wind zu gehen,
Geboren um zu verlieren,
Wohin ich geh', geh' ich allein.

Schlag' die Schlacht,
Leb wie Du willst.
Ich kenn' keine Not
Und keine Angst vor'm Tod.
Schlag' die Schlacht,
Du hast die Wahl,
Ich hab' ein Herz aus Stahl.

Geh den Weg nur vorwaerts,
Lasse nichts zurueck,
Es gibt nur eine Chance.

Die jetzt lachen und sich freu'n,
Werden es noch seh'n,
Sie werd'n wie Schnee vergeh'n.

Wir werden geh'n als ein starkes Heer,
Sie beugen das Haupt,
Ihr Mut geht dahin.

Dann lachen wir, vorbei die Qual
und seht das Herz aus Stahl,
zu hart fuer euch - zu hart fuer euch.

Schlag' die Schlacht,
Leb wie Du willst.
Ich kenn' keine Not
Und keine Angst vor'm Tod.
Schlag' die Schlacht,
Du hast die Wahl,
Ich hab' ein Herz aus Stahl.

Ich hab' ein Herz aus Stahl.
Schlag' die Schlacht,
Du hast die Wahl,
Ich hab' ein Herz aus Stahl.

Schlag' die Schlacht,
Leb wie Du willst.
Ich kenn' keine Not
Und keine Angst vor'm Tod.
Schlag' die Schlacht,
Du hast die Wahl,
Ich hab' ein Herz aus Stahl.

1. Return Of The Warlord
Now the time has come when all is said and done
We're back together on the road it's time to fly
No more time to wait you know it feels so great
Wearin leather on a horse of steel I ride
I ain't waiting to get old I'm runnin hot I'm never cold
Kiss my ass if you don't like me I don't care

We're all crazy gonna ride until we die

Time to burn you losers better learn
No one controls our goddamn lifes
We'll do just what we feel riding horses made of steel
We're here to burn up the night

Losers try to put us down it's just another day
I got no money or big house just got life
I don't like to save it's more fun to spend
If you like metal you're my friend
And that bike out in the yard well that's my wife
Don't try to understand me my family never will
Had to punch my teacher out now he's chilled
I might stay in school or die in prison
Either way it's my decision one more beer and heavy metal
And I'm just fine

Time to burn you losers better learn
No one controls our goddamn lifes
We'll do just what we feel riding horses made of steel
We're here to burn up the night

Feel the power of the wheel lets drink to riding steel
Livin hard and ridin fast

Time to burn you losers better learn
No one controls our goddam lifes
We'll do just what we feel riding horses made of steel
We're here to burn up the night

2. Brothers Of Metal Pt.1
Strike while the iron is hot
Steel is strongest so say we all
And if we all were not brothers of metal would we fall? No
They tried to test our spirit
They tasted steel before we were done
Grinding their bones into the dust of the past
All blown away like a shot from a gun

We cast our lot together four still stand as one
Here we'll remain forever till our kindgdoms one

Brothers of metal
We are fighting with power and steel
Fighting for metal that's all that's real
Brothers of metal will always be there
Standing together with hands in the air

Let us drink to the power drink to the sound
Thunder and metal are shaking the ground
Drink to your brothers who are never to fall
We're all brothers of metal here in the hall

Our hearts are filled with metal and masters we have none
And we will die for metal, metal heals, my son

Brothers of metal

3. The Gods Made Heavy Metal
In the beginning there was silence and darkness
All across the earth
Then came the wind and a hole in the sky
Thunder and lightning came crashing down
Hit the earth and split the ground
Fire burned high in the sky

From down below fire melted the stone
The ground shook and started to pound

The gods made heavy metal and they saw that is was good
They said to play it louder than Hell
We promised that we would
When losers say it's over with you know that it's a lie
The gods made heavy metal and it's never gonna die

We are the true believers
It's our turn to show the world
In the fire of heavy metal we were burned
It's more than our religion it's the only way to live
But the enemies of metal we can't forgive

Cause we believe in the power and the might
And the gods who made metal are with us tonight

The gods made heavy metal and they saw that is was good
They said to play it louder than Hell
We promised that we would
When losers say it's over with you know that it's a lie
The gods made heavy metal and it's never gonna die

We believe in the power and the might
And the gods who made metal are with us tonight

We're here tonight for heavy metal are you ready in the hall
They have chosen us and we have heard the call
Gonna tear the roof off with our sound

Crack the walls and shake the ground
Fight tonight for metal one and all

Cause we believe in the power and the might
And the gods who made metal are with us tonight

The gods made heavy metal and they saw that is was good
They said to play it louder than Hell
We promised that we would
When losers say it's over with you know that it's a lie
The gods made heavy metal and it's never gonna die

4. Courage
Some want to think hope is lost see me stand alone
I can't do what others may want then I'll have no home

So for now wave good-bye and leave your hands held high
Hear this song of courage long into the night
So for now wave good-bye and leave your hands held high
Hear this song of courage long into the night

And the wind will bear my cry to all who hope to fly
Hear this song of courage ride into the night

Battles are fought by those with the courage to believe
They are won by those who find the heart
Find a heart to share
This heart that fills the soul will point the way to victory
If there's a fight then I'll be there, I'll be there

So for now wave good-bye, leave your hands held high
Hear this song of courage long into the night
And the wind will bear my cry to all who hope to fly
Lift your wings up high my friend fearless to the end
So for now wave good-bye, leave your hands held high
Hear this song of courage ride into the night

5. Number 1
We belong to the world we belong to the wind
We are the spirit of the competition's end
Turning hours into days burning muscles feel the pain
The heart and soul of discipline my friends

We are sending you a challenge it's very clear
We came to win that is why we are here
Demanding to be tested, tested by the best
Not to be forgotten like all the rest

The time has come all the training done
The muscle and the blood will come to pay

Let the game begin hear the starting gun
Play from the heart today we will overcome
When the game is over all the counting's done
We were born to win number 1

Today is the day all the training through
We have come for the number one not the number two
Let the contest begin play hard fight to win
Immortality victory and fame

The time has come all the training done
The muscle and the blood will come to pay

Play from the heart today we will overcome
When the game is over all the counting's done
We were born to win number 1

Today is the day all the training through

6. Outlaw
I'm a stranger in town and my guns never cold
I'm a gambler so bet on your life
You'll never live to grow old
I deal in lead I won't step aside
Where trouble's waitin well so am I
I live for the fight the thrill of the kill
Paid in gold for the blood I spill

Outlaw outlaw outlaw ride
Into the West a gun by your side
Hell and glory honor and pride
A gun will decide where the outlaws ride

The law of the West was the law of the gun
Shoot and be fast live on the run
Stay alive be fast on the draw
Live by the gun or die by the law

Outlaw outlaw outlaw ride
Into the West a gun by your side
Hell and glory honor and pride
A gun will decide where the outlaws ride
Shot through the heart in the blink of an eye
Buried up on boot hill
Life is cheap when the bounty is high
So be ready to kill

The law of the West was the law of the gun
Shoot and be fast live on the run
Stay alive be fast on the draw
live by the gun or die by the law
Shot of whisky I'll be on my way
Back in the saddle pull on the reins
Spurs to the beast over the hill
Another town one more kill

Outlaw outlaw outlaw ride
Into the West a gun by your side
Hell and glory honor and pride
A gun will decide where the outlaws ride

7. King
Now is the time to reach for the sky
Gather the wind hear the voice to fly
To know why they sing about heroes and kings
Who were brave and not afraid to die
Look and you'll see that a new day will bring
The will to go on and fight through endless suffering
For all who believe wait a crown a ring
The power of the man who would be king
The power of the man who would be king

Into the fight of hopes and dreams
The master of the wind knows nothing's what is seems
The melting of the soul the wish of those who scheme
The taking of the will by destroyers of the dream
They live to spread the fear of the wrong of right of self
They want us all to live like books upon a shelf
But we know we have the power to fight and make a stand
Strike when we are challenged all across the land to be king

Fight for the crown, fight for the ring
We're fighting the world, we fight for the king

Time to face the world let brothers never fight
Forever forge ahead and keep the dream in sight
For those who never try they are sure to fail
The heart's a righteous wind that comes to fill the sail
For the glory of the king we fight to stay alive
By the power of the will, the spirit to survive to be king

Fight for the crown, fight for the ring
We're fighting the world, we fight for the king

All of the dreams held deep inside have a meaning to the soul
Freedom to bring a thought to the wing is waiting to unfold
For the crown and the ring
The power of the man who would be king

Fight for the crown, fight for the ring
We're fighting the world, we fight for the king

For the glory of the king we fight to stay alive - Fight
By the power of the will the spirit to survive - Fight
Across the gates of Heaven beyond the gates of Hell - Fight
We fought to stay together
We have won and have lived to tell who would be king

Fight for the crown, fight for the ring
We're fighting the world, we fight for the king

10. The Power
I've got the power to fly into the wind
The power to be free to die and live again
This power's like fire, fire loves to burn
Make the world a grave of ashes in an urn
The power in the darkness to see without my sight
Walk among the living free of wrong and right
The power of the magic the power of the spell
Not to serve in Heaven but one day to rule in Hell

Power the power the power

This power's greater than love and of hate
This is the power of will and of fate
The power to kill the power to feel
The power of blood the triumph of steel
Greater that the power of a priest or a sinner
The power to defy to fight and be the winner
The power of the demons spirits I command
Always by my side to serve the master's plan

Power the power the power

None can fight the power none can fight the wind
Secrets of all life and death are carried there within
Call out to the power of the darkness and light
Have dominion of the earth be lord of all the night
Kill all those who stand against you look into their eyes
Drink their blood and laugh as they pay for all their lies
Piss upon their graves then cast a final spell
Fly into the night and one day meet in Hell

Power the power the power

MANOWAR LYRICS


1. Call To Arms
When they see us they will run for their lives
To the end they will pay for their lies
So long did we wait, now we are home

Here once again there's a battle to fight
Gather together for the sound and the might
So long did we wait, now we are home

Now we will fight for the kingdom, fighting with steel
Kill all of them, their blood is our seal
Fight till the last of the enemy is dead
Ride through their blood that we gladly have shed

I now issue the call, are you ready to fight - yeah
Fight altogether as one for the right
To be free once again - tonight we will win

I can see by the look that you have in your eyes
You came here for metal, to fight and to die
Defenders of steel, now we are home

Fight for the kingdom bound for glory
Armed with a heart of steel
I swear by the brothers who stand before me
To no man shall I kneel
Their blood is upon my steel

[Repeat 3, 4, 5, chorus to fade]

2. Fight For Freedom
There's a sound heard across the land
It's heard across the sea
You'll only hear it if you listen with your hearts
And one day hope to be free

To hear the sound of freedom many gave their lives
They fought for you and me
Those memories will always live inside us
And now it's our time to be free

[Chorus:]
Where the eagles fly - I will soon be there
If you want to - come along with me my friend
Say the words and you'll be free
From the mountains to the sea
We'll fight for freedom again

Scream out loud for all the world to hear
From sea to shining sea ??
Let freedom ring and every man be king
To live as one through the years

[Repeat chorus]

Now is the time we all must stand together
So raise your hands show them we are strong
Side by side the fight goes on forever
Marching to the battle with this song

[Repeat chorus to fade]

3. Nessun Dorna
Nessun dorma, nessun dorma
Tu pure, o principessa,
Nella tua fredda stanza
Guardi le stelle che tremano
D'amore e di speranza!
Ma il mio mistero e chiuso in me,
Il nome mio nessun sapra!
No, no, sulla tua bocca lo diro,
Quando la luce splendera!
Ed il mio bacio sciogliera
Il silenzio che ti fa mia!

Dilegua, o notte!
Tramontate, stelle, tramontate, stelle!
All'alba vincero, vincero, vincero!
Dilegua, o notte!
Tramontate, stelle, tramontate, stelle!
All'alba vincero, vincero, vincero!

4. Valhalla

5. Swords In The Wind
I surrender my soul
Odin hear my call
One day I'll sit beside your throne
In Valhalla's great hall
Like so many before me
I'll die with honor and pride

The right of the warrior
Forever to fight by your side
Send a sign, raise the sail
Wave a last goodbye
Destiny is calling
Immortality be mine

Call the witch to cast the runes
Weave a magic spell
We who die in battle are born
Not for heaven, not for hell

[Bridge:]
We are sons of Odin
The fire we burn inside
Is the legacy of warrior kings
Who reign above in the sky

[Chorus:]
I will lead the charge
My sword into the wind
Sons of Odin fight
To die and live again
Viking ships cross the sea
In cold wind and rain
Sail into the black of night
Magic stars our guiding light

Today the blood of battle
Upon my weapons will never dry
Many I'll send into the ground
Laughing as they die

[Repeat bridge, chorus]

Place my body on a ship
And burn it on the sea
Let my spirit rise
Valkiries carry me
Take me to Valhalla
Where my brothers wait for me
Fires burn into the sky
My spirit will never die

[Repeat chorus to fade]

6. An American Trilogy
Oh I wish I was in the land of cotton
Old times they are not forgotten
Look away, look away, look away Dixie land

Oh I wish I was in Dixie away, away
In Dixie land I'll take my stand
To live and die in Dixie

Dixie land where I was born
Early Lord one frosty morning
Look away, look away, look away Dixie land

Glory, glory, hallelujah
Glory, glory, hallelujah
Glory, glory, hallelujah
This truth is marching on

So hush little baby, don't you cry
You know your daddy's bound to die
All my trials Lord will soon be over

Glory, glory, hallelujah
This truth is marching on
This truth is marching on

7. The March

8. Warriors Of The World (United)
Here our soldiers stand from all around the world
Waiting in a line to hear the battle cry
All are gathered here, victory is near
The sound will fill the hall, bringing power to us all

We alone are fighting for metal that is true
We own the right to live the fight, we're here for all of you
Now swear the blood upon your steel will never dry
Stand and fight together beneath the battle sky

[Chorus:]
Brothers everywhere - raise your hands into the air
We're warriors, warriors of the world
Like thunder from the sky - sworn to fight and die
We're warriors, warriors of the world

Many stand against us, but they will never win
We said we would return and here we are again
To bring them all destruction, suffering and pain
We are the hammer of the gods, we are thunder, wind and rain.

There they wait in fear with swords in feeble hands
With dreams to be a king, first one should be a man
I call about and charge them all with a life that is a lie
And in their final hour they shall confess before they die

[Repeat chorus]

If I should fall in battle, my brothers who fight by my side
Gather my horse and weapons, tell my family how I died
Until then I will be strong, I will fight for all that is real
All who stand in my way will die by steel

Brothers everywhere - raise your hands into the air
We're warriors, warriors of the world

[Repeat chorus to fade]

9. Hand Of Doom
Hands of doom are reaching out to crush all infidels who stray
Time to know the pain, no time to run within
And these hands you see before you will end the light of day
Your ashes will be cast into the wind
Your blood's upon the soil, your body fed to wolves
Not one of you will be left alive
Hear the sound pounding and the army of the night
By the hammer of Thor you now shall die

[Chorus:]
Tonight we strike, there is thunder in the sky
Together we'll fight, some of us will die
But they'll always remember that we made a stand
And many will die by my hand

High atop the mountain, with hammers in the wind
Lusting for blood and death again
In a flash of lightning strike now the house of death invites you
Body and soul to come within
I see the fear you have inside, you can run but never hide
I will hunt you down and tear you limb from limb
Nothing shall remain, not your memory, your name
It will be as though you never, ever lived

[Repeat chorus, 2nd verse, chorus]

10. House Of Death
Blood and thunder mix with rain
Into the kingdom of darkness again
Lightning flash and body in flame
All shall kneel at the sound of my name
My path is set, I live with no regret
I'm sworn to kill, never to forget

[Chorus:]
No road back, I never will return
Into the fire of hell I will burn
And die, die, die into the house of death
And die, die, die into the fire of hell

Army of the heavens, my army waits in hell
To battle on the earth, for all the souls who fell
I will not go onto my death alone
Seven gates to pass until I reach my home
Across the bridge of death, beyond the gates of light
Into the heart of darkness, into the black of night

[Repeat chorus]

Into the darkness I command my soul
Never shall I repent, never shall I be saved
I go into the house of death
Before my last breath my enemies all shall die

Die, die, die into the house of death
Die, die, die into the fire of hell

11. Fight Until We Die
When they come, I'll be ready
I hear their voices inside
The stars in the heavens are moving
Soon they will align

Thor, god of thunder
Let me die with a sword in my hand
Raise your hands, swords in the wind
Brothers of metal together again
With blood in our voices we ride
We'll fight till we win or we'll fight until we die

Gods of thunder, fire and rain
Cut into the earth till none shall remain
Sons of demons I command you to fly
Ride on from hell into the sky
We'll fight until we die

[Repeat all]

1. Manowar
We met on English ground
in a backstage room
We heard the sound
And we all knew what we had to do

We called the high command
Requested leave to make a stand
And in the field we grew
And we all knew

Soon the time would come
For us to fight,
Destination
now in sight

Oooh, Manowar
Born to live forever more
The right to conquer every shore
Hold your ground and give no more

Our fight will never end
So we called on partisans
To raise your hands
And take our stand

Look sharp
when duty calls
Where we march
cities fall
And the strong survive
And take our side

2. Kings Of Metal
Manowar Manowar living on the road
When we're in town speakers explode
We don't attract wimps 'cause we're too loud
Just true metal people that's Manowar's crowd

They wanna keep us down
But they can't last
When we get up we're gonna kick your ass
Gonna keep on burnin'
We always will
Other bands play Manowar kill
Other bands play Manowar kill

We like it hard, we like it fast
We got the biggest amps, man they blast
True metal people wanna rock not pose
Wearin' jeans and leather, not cracker jack clothes

They wanna keep us down
But they can't last
When we get up we're gonna kick your ass
Gonna keep on burnin'
We always will
Other bands play Manowar kill
Other bands play Manowar kill

We're the kings of metal commin' to town
When we light up, have the roof nailed down
Don't try to tell us that we're too loud
'Cause there ain't no way that we'll ever turn down

They wanna keep us down
But they can't last
When we get up we're gonna kick your ass
Gonna keep on burnin'
We always will
Other bands play Manowar kill

3. Kill With Power
Hear what's written on the wind.
We come to kill and kill again.
Our arrows fall like hail
Trample on the dead. - Ride through the
Gate of clouds - stand on the open step.

Run beserk - spreading fear and pain.
Black shield and weapons, black our chain.
None can harm us - not their fire -
Iron or steel - for we have the
Will to power - with power we will
Kill.

Kill with power - die die
Kill with power - die die

To the war god Odin you will pray.
And the curse of weapons shall
Remain. On the blood of all our
Fathers - on their weapons we now
Swear to avenge - not lament.
Give the False ones death.

Kill with power - die die
Kill with power - die die

4. Sign Of The Hammer
The spell has been broken,
the curse has been lifted
Black is the wind on the heels
Of the Gifted
Four sworn to vengeance,
See the hate in our eyes
Called by the Gods, and given a sign

Onward pounding Into Glory Ride
Sign of the Hammer be my guide
Final warning all stand aside
Sign of the Hammer it's my time

Pounding, pounding, we are back from the dead
those who denied us are delivered instead
Into the hands of Four sworn to ride
Now the people will triumph and live by the sign

5. My Spirit Lives On

6. Piano Interlude

7. Courage
Some Want To Think Hope Is Lost See Me Stand Alone
I Can't Do What Others May Want Then I'll Have No Home

So For Now Wave Good-bye And Leave Your Hands Held High
Hear This Song Of Courage Long Into The Night
So For Now Wave Good-bye Leave Your Hands Held High
Hear This Song Of Courage Long Into The Night

And The Wind Will Bear My Cry To All Who Hope To Fly
Hear This Song Of Courage Ride Into The Night

Battles Are Fought By Those With The Courage To Believe
They Are Won By Those Who Find The Heart
Find A Heart To Share
This Heart That Fills The Soul Will Point The Way To Victory
If There's A Fight Then I'll Be There I'll Be There

So For Now Wave Good-bye, Leave Your Hands Held High
Hear This Song Of Courage Long Into The Night
And The Wind Will Bear My Cry To All Who Hope To Fly
Lift Your Wings Up High My Friend Fearless To The End
So For Now Wave Good-bye, Leave Your Hands Held High
Hear This Song Of Courage Long Into The Night

8. Spirit Horse Of The Cherokee
The trail of tears began for all the Cherokee
The white men came to trade & borrow but then they would not leave
Some of us were taken by boat, and died at sea
Those of us who lived were sold to slavery

We welcomed them as brothers knowing nothing of their greed
Born hunters not the hunted as the white man hunts for me
We are descendants of the animals we live among the free
Our trail of tears would end one day at Wounded Knee.

Great Spirit, thunder birds fly, we are wild and free
To fight and die by the open sky, Spirit Horse ride for me

When we do the Ghost Dance, the buffalo will return
Paint ourselves for war, now blood and fire burn
Great Spirit makes us strong, take us to the sky
The Cherokee are brave, we are not afraid to die

Great Spirit, thunder birds fly, we are wild and free
To fight and die by the open sky, Spirit Horse ride for me

Red Cloud, Black Hawk, Sitting Bull, Crazy Horse, Geronimo
Strong and brave warriors to the grave

There has been much killing there will be much more
The Medicine Man is dancing he's calling us to war,
Hatchets sing with pride let the white men die

Great Spirit, thunder birds fly, we are wild and free
To fight and die by the open sky, Spirit Horse ride for me

9. Blood Of My Enemies
Three sons have I, and they
Ride by my side. - The fierce,
The black, and the wicked are
their names - we ride down my
enemies on their half-hearted flight.
No voice of mercy - no evangels of light.

Mighty messengers - heathens rage
Witness our coming - gods of the dead.
I ride through the air -
I laugh as I die - with powers of evil
Dark knowledge is mine.
The ride of the wicked.
The 1st sin was trust. -
Kill without warning - for blood now
I lust.

Strong winds - magic mist
To Asgard the Valkries fly
High overhead - they carry the dead
Where the blood of my enemy lies.

Three sons have I, and they
Ride by my side. - The fierce,
The black, and the wicked are
their names - we ride down my
enemies on their half-hearted flight.
No voice of mercy - no evangels of light.

Strong winds - magic mist
To Asgard the Valkries fly
High overhead - they carry the dead
Where the blood of my enemy lies.

10. Hail And Kill
Brothers I am calling from the valley of the kings
with nothing to atone
A dark march lies ahead, together we will ride like
thunder from the sky
May your sword stay wet like a young girl in her
prime
Hold your hammers high

Blood and death are waiting like a raven in the sky
I was born to die
Hear me while I live
As I look into your eyes
None shall hear a lie
Power and dominion are taken by the will
By divine right hail and kill

Hail, Hail, Hail and Kill, Hail and Kill
Hail, Hail, Hail and Kill, Hail and Kill

My father was a wolf
I'm a kinsman of the slain
Sworn to rise again
I will bring salvation, punishment and pain
The hammer of hate is our faith
Power and dominion are taken by the will
By divine right hail and kill

Hail, Hail, Hail and Kill, Hail and Kill
Hail, Hail, Hail and Kill, Hail and Kill

Rip their flesh
Burn their hearts
Stab them in the eyes
Rape their women as they cry
Kill their servants
Burn their homes
Till there's no blood left to spill
Hail and Kill
Power and dominion are taken by the will
By divine right hail and kill

Hail, Hail, Hail and Kill, Hail and Kill

12. Wheels Of Fire
Since the dawn of time
I've rolled across the earth
Spinning in the dust
Long before your birth
Eating tar and gasoline
Every light I see is green
Open pipes, my machine's triple-plated chrome

Spirit of the wheel

Wheels of fire burn the night
Ride across the sky
Wheels of fire burning bright
We live to ride

Motors running
Now you're gonna learn
Waiting on the line
Make your tires burn
Fast, faster, faster, faster
Speeding always kills
Nothing else takes us to get these thrills

Spirit of the wheel

Wheels of fire burn the night
Ride across the sky
Wheels of fire burning bright
We live to ride

Blood and thunder on the road
My heart is pounding
My blood is nitroglycerine
I'm fire
Burning, burning, burning, burning
Ready to explode
Don't want nothing left of me to scrape off the road

Spirit of the wheel

Wheels of fire burn the night
Ride across the sky
Wheels of fire burning bright
We live to ride

Clouds of smoke
Tires screaming
Fire in my hair
Blown into a thousand pieces
Scattered everywhere
Fast, burn, burning, faster
Wanna take a ride
Spirit of the wheel
Wheels of fire ride

Spirit of the wheel

Wheels of fire burn the night
Ride across the sky
Wheels of fire burning bright
We live to ride

17. Thor (The Powerhead)
Black clouds on the horizon
Great thunder and burning rain
His chariot pounding,
I heard the heavens scream his name

I watched as he shouted
To the giants that died that day
He hehd up his hammer high
And called to Odin for a sign

Thor the mighty, Thor the brave
Crush the infidels in your way
By your hammer let none be saved
Live to die on that final day
Gods, Monsters and Men
We'll die together in the end

God of thunder, god of rain

Swing your hammer to crack the sky
Lift your cape so that you might fly
Back to Odin and the Gods on High
And leave this mortal world

20. Black Wind, Fire And Steel
Full moon light is calling me
My kigndom lies within
The mystic soul and lions heart
Brought by the talisman
The ecstasy of battle takes me
Where the falcons fly
Immortal youth was granted me
I will never die

Born of Black wind fire and steel
Born of Black wind fire and steel
Born to teach them all to heel
Born of Black wind fire and steel

Pounded by the hammers
Of the giants of the world
I can see in darkness
I'm the overlord
Single combat I await
My shadow brings them fear
The spikes upon my chariot
Will grind them when they're near

Born of Black wind fire and steel
Born of Black wind fire and steel
Born to teach them all to heel
Born of Black wind fire and steel

I am an outcast on the path of no return
Punisher and swordsman
I was born to burn
Black Wind always follows
Where my black horse rides
Fire's in my soul
Steel is on my side

Born of Black wind fire and steel
Born of Black wind fire and steel
Born to teach them all to heel
Born of Black wind fire and steel

21. Return Of The Warlord
Now The Time Has Come When All Is Said And Done
We're Back Together On The Road It's Time To Fly

22. Carry On
The north star always guides me
When winter skies are gray
And I wait for sun when all are one
I shall not betray
Calling at me
I'm waiting when all are led astray

Carry on my sons forever
Carry On when I am gone
Carry On for when the day is long
Forever Carry On
For as long as we're together
Then forever Carry On

Darkness all around us
We don't close our eyes
No one's gonna ground us
We were born to fly
Comin' at us no stopping
Born to amplify

Carry on my sons forever
Carry On when I am gone
Carry On when the day is long
Forever Carry On
For as long as we're together
Then forever Carry On

Yeah, be my brother
Fight to stay alive
All the world can't change us
With all their burned-out jive
Come get us now we're waiting
We won't run and hide

Carry on my sons forever
Carry On when I am gone
Carry On when the day is long
Forever Carry On
For as long as we're together
Then forever Carry On

Now we're all together
Let's sing a fighting song
One hundred thousand riders
We can't all be wrong
Comin' at us no stopping
Always Carry On

Carry on my sons forever
Carry On when I am gone
Carry On when the day is long
Forever Carry On
For as long as we're together
Forever Carry On

23. Battle Hymn
By moonlight we ride ten thousands side by side
With swords drawn held high our whips and armour shine
Hail to thee our infantry still brave beyond the grave
All sworn the eternal vow the time to strike is now

Gone are the days when freedom shone now blood and steel meet bone
In the light of the battle's way the sands of time will shake
How proud our soldiers stand with mace and chain in hand
Sound of charge into glory ride over the top of their vanguished pride

To the battle we ride we crossed a starlit sky
No space no time we'll catch the wind
Strange losses, men died we crossed a starlit sky
And still no space and time we'll catch the wind

1. The Ascension
[Christopher Lee]
Powers of the universe did sire a son...
He was baptized by fire, water, earth, and sky...
From darkness, he rose up in triumph
To ascend the throne of light,
And he alone shall ever be known
As the King of Kings...

[Eric Adams]
I enter this world born under a sign of infinite light,
And there I shall dwell. I now understand...
All that I am shall live in my command...

2. King Of Kings
Voices of Victory
All Shout and proclaim
The Kingdom of Glory is mine
The Raise of the will are a prophecy filled

I'm the lord of the day and the night
I have nothing to sell but the power of hell
My Armies of fire awaits
I'm here to be paid for the pact that was made
My payments can never be late

Crack the Earth, Gods of Thunder
Men and beast will be torn asunder
Into the Fight I own the right
To be the King of kings

My Enemies rise and look to the skies
They Pray I will never appear
The Light has no meaning
Awake me I'm dreaming
They live in a castle of fear

I summon the demons that live in the wind
As my Chariot strives in the Storm
With the hot blood of Battle
I wait in my saddle
I live and I'll die by the sword

Crack the Earth, Gods of Thunder
Men and beast will be torn asunder
Into the Fight I own the right
To be the King of kings

All the days of his live
He walked without fear
All who's lives he touched
Were made better for knowing him
As he returned goodness with good
So true is justice and retribution In failing

As my sword is my soul
Then let all who stand before me know
I bring a storm and Magic wind
The Kingdom of the Kings

1. The Dawn Of Battle
Dreadful Thunder
The storms moving in
And Judgment day is calling
My soul has been healed
By the power of steel
And the sound of glory 

I will send into the ground
All that are found
By the sign of the hammer falling
Yes Heathens will fall
I will strike down them all
Then you will know my calling

Bravery calls my name
In the sound of the wind in the night
My sword will drink blood
And I will fight
Yes I will fight
In the dawn of battle
Dawn of Battle

I will rise up from the chaos
I will rise up from the grave
A brother to the darkness
A master to the slaves

I am the soul descendent
Of the fire and the rage
I was wrought upon the earth
Born to rule and battle wage

By the total domination
Of the world in my command
By the Air and the water
By the Fire and the land

I give no explanation
I was branded by the will
Bringer of Death and Destruction
To all that I now kill

Bravery calls my name
In the sound of the wind in the night
My sword will drink blood
And I will fight
Yes I will fight
In the dawn of battle
Dawn of Battle

I long to be free
So I wait for a sign
I wait for a star
To fall from the sky
From the dust of sleep
A promise to keep
Then all who see shall believe
Deliver into my hand
The sword of the land
Let my journey begin
So all shall understand
That if I fall
I will live again

I will rise up from the chaos
I will rise up from the grave
A brother to the darkness
A master to the slaves

I give no explanation
I was branded by the will
To bring of Death and Destruction
To all that I now kill

Bravery calls my name
In the sound of the wind in the night
My sword will drink blood
And I will fight
Yes I will fight
In the dawn of battle

2. I Believe
From the darkness I walk into the light
From the day I walk into the night
From the shadows I will appear
With a message for all who will hear

For the weak of heart I will be strong
To the defenders of faith I will belong
Till the last of us fight till we die
Till the keys of the kingdome are mine

All stand together for the world to see
Now the time is right to live out all our dreams
Say the words forever, your strength will never leave
If you want to win the fight, say "I believe"

[Verse 1,2,3]

Let's all stand together for the world to see
Now the time is right to live out all our dreams
Say the words forever, your strength will never leave
If you want to win the fight, say "I believe"
If you want to win tonight, say "I believe"

3. Call To Arms
When they see us they will run for their lives
To the end they will pay for their lies
So long did we wait, now we are home

Here once again there's a battle to fight
Gather together for the sound and the might
So long did we wait now we are home

Now we will fight for the Kingdom fighting with steel
Kill all of them, their blood is our seal
Fight till the last of the enemy is dead
Ride through their blood that we gladly have shed

I now issue the call, are you ready to fight - yeah
Fight all together as one for the right to be free once again
Tonight we will win

I can see by the look that you have in your eyes
You came here for metal, to fight and to die
Defenders of Steel now we are home

Fight for the kingdom bound for glory
Armed with a heart of steel
I swear by the Brothers who stand before me
To no man shall I kneel
Their blood is upon my steel
Blood is upon my steel

Fight for the Kingdom fighting with steel
Kill all of them, their blood is our seal
Fight till the last of the enemy is dead
Ride through their blood that we gladly have shed

I now issue the call, are you ready to fight - yeah
Fight all together as one for the right to be free once again
Tonight we will win

I can see by the look that you have in your eyes
You came here for metal, to fight and to die
Defenders of Steel now we are home

Fight for the kingdom bound for glory
Armed with a heart of steel
I swear by the Brothers who stand before me
To no man shall I kneel
Their blood is upon my steel

Scorch the land

[Narration:]
...Onward into the heart of battle
Fought the sons of Odin
Outnumbered many times
Still
they fought on
Blood poured fourth from their wounds
Deep into the earth
Vultures waited for the broken shells
That once were bodies
But Odin alone would choose the day
They would enter Valhalla
And in their hour of need
He sent forth unto them The Berserker Rage
Now gods and men
They rose up from the ground
Screaming like wild animals
Such is the gift of absolute power
No blade or weapon would harm them
They killed them and horses alike
And all who stood before them died that day

Hail Gods Of War!!!!!

4. Army Of The Dead, Part I
Raise thy weapons on this day
Ye shall not die alone

Fight and die let Valkyries fly
For they shall take thee home

I promise thee that on this night

Asgard's halls await with heroes
Brothers that have died

For thee we wait at Asgard's gates
Come join us by our side

Valhalla waits so choose thy fate
For all of us must die!

5. Sleipnir
He is descended from giants. His father Loki,
God of fire, is the sworn blood brother to
Odin himself. He rides across land, sea and air
From the land of the living, to the land of
The dead. This eight legged steed crosses eight
Points of the compass, from eight directions
Into eight dimensions. He is bringer of the
Valiant dead from the battlefield to Valhalla!

Carry we who die in battle
Over land and sea
Across the rainbow bridge to Valhalla
Odin's waiting for me

He was born of giants
His icy coat is grey
At night he rides into the world of death
The living by day

One day on his back I shall ride
From the battlefield into the sky
Borne by Valkyries we valiant dead
Into the hall of heroes shall be led

Ride down from Asgard
To the battlefield
Bringer of the valiant dead
Who died but never yielded

Carry we who die in battle
Over land and sea
Across the rainbow bridge to Valhalla
Odin's waiting for me

Faster then the fastest horse alive
The living son of fire rides
From the halls of across the sky
To the world of gods and men

Eight legs and magic runes
Carved upon his teeth
Thunder and lightning
Sound beneath his feet
On his back the war god Odin rides
Sword and magic spear held high

Ride down from Asgard
To the battlefield
Bringer of the valiant dead
Who died but never yielded

Carry we who die in battle
Over land and sea
Across the rainbow bridge to Valhalla
Odin's waiting for me

6. Loki God Of Fire
The son of giants
Walks across the sky
To the gods a friend
Fathered beast and men

As a falcon he did fly
Far across the sky
To take back the hammer
Of Thor his friend

He lives between the worlds
The world of gods and men

He is the god of fire
Burning higher
God of fire
Into the sky

The father of a wolf
And the serpent of the sea
The ruler of hell
A giant is he

To Odin he's a brother
A brother who is sly
One who changes shape
Who walks across the sky

He lives between the worlds
The world of gods and men

He is the god of fire
Burning higher
God of fire
Into the sky

God of fire
Burning higher
God of fire
Into the sky

Brother to Thor
And Odin god of war
Loki god of fire
Reigns for evermore

The father of a wolf
And the serpent of the sea
The ruler of hell
A giant is he

To Odin he's a brother
A brother who is sly
One who changes shape
Who walks across the sky
God of fire

Burning higher
God of fire
Into the sky

7. Blood Brothers
When the world turns you away
A friend will not say no
There is strength that we all have
It's not the strength we show

And in your darkest hour
In your darkest nights
Whatever life will do
I am here for you

Think of me wherever you are
When it seems like you're reaching the end
Call on me, know in your heart
On one you can always depend
I am thy friend

Though we're far away
The stars above are the same
And when you feel alone
There's one who shares your pain

A true friend has no price
There is none to pay
I remember you stood by me
I'm with you all the way

Think of me wherever you are
When it seems like you're reaching the end
Call on me, know in your heart
One who will always defend
I am thy friend

Think of me wherever you are
When it seems like you're reaching the end
Call on me, know in your heart
On one you can always depend
I am thy friend

Think of me wherever you are
When it seems like you're reaching the end
Call on me, know in your heart
One who will always defend
I am thy friend

8. Overture To Odin
[Instrumental]

9. The Blood Of Odin
Upon his shoulders perch two ravens, Hugin and Munin.
They circle the earth by day seeing all, at night they report to him the world's tidings.
He wears a golden helmet and a golden ring, at his side sit two wolves.
His weapons a magic sword and a spear called Gungnir, they are carved with runes.
His eight legged horse Sleipnir carries him over land, sea and air, the bringer of the valiant dead, the einherjar, from the battlefield across the rainbow bridge to Valhalla.

For a single drink of the enchanted water he paid with one eye, he was granted supreme wisdom.
He is the god of poetry, sorcery, and death.
Wounded, pierced by a spear he hung upside down for nine days.
Fasting and agony he made of himself a sacrifice to himself.
Given no bread nor mead he looked down, and with a loud cry fell screaming from the world tree.
In a flash of insight the secret magic of the runes was revealed to him.
He took up the runes and mastered them, eighteen powerful charms for protection, success in battle, lovemaking, healing and the power to bring back the dead.

His sacred blood mixed with black wind and rain wept down from the world tree deep into the earth.
He commanded the earth to crack open and to spew forth the strongest of the strong!

On this day he did bestow unto the world the sons of Odin!

10. The Sons Of Odin
Here to the blaze
I wander
Through this black night
I pounder
The edge of our mighty swords

Fallen by our axes
Helmets smash

Glory and fame

[Onward into the heart of battle
Fought the sons of Odin
Outnumbered many times
Still - they fought on
Blood poured forth from their wounds
Deep into the earth
Vultures waited for the broken shells
That once were bodies
Thus Odin alone would choose the day
They would enter Valhalla
And in their hour of need
He sent forth onto them The Berserker Rage
Now gods embed
They rose up from the ground
Screaming like wild animals
Such is the gift of absolute power
No blade or weapon would hurt them
They killed them and horses alike
And all who stood before them died that day
Hail Gods Of War]

11. Glory Majesty Unity
Deep into the heart of the battle they fought. Covered on
All sides as all converged on them, until the four could
No longer be seen. As time passed I feared them lost, then
Slowly the armies separated, many were dead. I saw the four
Each down on one knee, all stopped to watch and gaze
Upon them with a smile of victory before sending them into
The ground.

Then they rose together to make a final stand. With their
Last bit of strength they raised their arms into the air pointing
Blood stained weapons to the sky. They called upon the god
Of war and made ready to die. But Odin would not call
Them this day to Valhalla, instead he sent thunder and
Lightning to strike the ground, bestowing upon them the
One gift every warrior lives in hope of - the berserker rage!

Now filled with that strength, the power of a thousand
Men was given them. No longer mortal they were touched
By the gods. This time when they took up the attack, men fell
Not by tens, but by hundreds, by thousands. And when the
Smoke did clear, the four spoke the words and the masses
Answered the response of the warrior's prayer.

Gods of war I call you
My sword is by my side
I seek a life of honor
Free from all false pride

I will crack the whip
With a bold mighty hail
Cover me with death
If I should ever fail

Glory, majesty, unity
Hail! Hail! Hail!

12. Gods Of War
Down from the sky
Into the fight
Hearts full of rage
Full of thunder and glory
Swords in the wind
Crossing the sky
Lords of doom
Bring an end to their story

Father on bended knee
I ask thee
Raise thy hand
We the sons of Odin
Await thy command
Born under the sign
Of the hammer we stand
And here we all may die
Our blood on the ground
The battle horns sound
Let thy Valkyries fly

Down from the sky
Into the fight
Hearts full of rage
Full of thunder and glory
Swords in the wind
Crossing the sky
Lords of doom
Bring an end to their story

Today is the day
We die in the fight
None shall remain
To pass one more night
Now Valhalla's calling us
Immortal
We are gods of war
Immortal
We are gods of war

Odin here the fallen wait
To join thee by thy side
Let Valhalla's gates open wide
Born under the sign
Of the hammer they lived
And here they fought and died
Their blood on the ground
The battle horns sound
Let thy Valkyries fly

Down from the sky
Into the fight
Hearts full of rage
Full of thunder and glory
Swords in the wind
Crossing the sky
Lords of doom
Bring an end to their story

Today is the day
We die in the fight
None shall remain
To pass one more night
Now Valhalla's calling us
Immortal
We are gods of war

Hearts full of rage
Full of thunder and glory
Swords in the wind
Crossing the sky
Lords of doom
Bring an end to their story

13. Army Of The Dead, Part II
Raise thy weapons on this day
Ye shall not die alone

Fight and die let Valkyries fly
For they shall take thee home

I promise thee that on this night
Ye shall be by my side

Asgard's halls await with heroes
Brothers that have died

For thee we wait at Asgard's gates
Come join us by our side

Valhalla waits so choose thy fate
For all of us must die!

14. Odin
In the hall of the slain
Valkyries and heroes attend me
Ravens and wolves at my side
Forever they did befriend me

I paid an eye for a drink of mead
And was given wisdom supreme
Granted to me the secrets
Of magic, of life and death

Ah.. Speared hung upside down
Nine days and nights no food nor mead
The will to be a sacrifice
Of myself unto myself

Wisdom and rhyme
Sorcery, death living inside me
Of life and death I am king
For both do I bring by sword and spear and ring

Raise thy weapons on this day
Ye shall not die alone

Fight and die let Valkyries fly
For they shall take thee home

I promise thee that on this night
Ye shall be by my side

Asgard's halls await with hero's
Brothers that have died

For thee we wait at Asgard's gates
Come join us by our side

Valhalla waits so choose thy fate
For all of us must die!

15. Hymn Of The Immortal Warriors
A hero was he
Touching all our lives
As if he lived and died
In a single moment

Great were his deeds
All his words were true
He lived and died
A man of honor

He paid with his life
For his life was the price
To pass the gates immortal

Thy journey begins
With sword in the wind
Stay thy hand rest thy command
For Odin's call was heard above them all
Thy name shall never die!

Long shall we remember
He who walked the road of danger
Master of revenge
Death's no stranger

Blood and death lived on his sword
The god of war his only lord
Into the depths of hell
Go all he fell

Take thy shield take thy sword
All thy weapons to the sky
Ye shall need them when Odin bid thee rise

For none but the brave
Shall rise up from the grave
To see the Valkyries fly

And so it was by the hand of Odin
Did the immortal warrior pass through
The gates of Valhalla and into legend.

Rise brother rise pass Valhalla's gates
Here great warriors await

Reborn from thy steel
All thy wounds be healed

From the earth to the sky
Now the son of Odin rise!

Take thy place among the kings
For thy soul shall never die!

16. Die For Metal
They can't stop us
Let 'em try
For heavy metal
We will die!

Quit my job this morning said forever
I would hold my head up high
Cause I need metal in my life
Just like an eagle needs to fly

So I walked outside into the street
From a hall I heard thunder and screams
I walked inside so I could hear
And the guy beside me gave me a beer

He had his fist up in the air
And called me brother said my friends
Are over there

They call themselves immortals
They're the truest of the true
And in that very moment
I was born again like you

They said hold your head up high
Raise your fist up in the air
Play metal louder than hell
Louder than hell

They can't stop us
Let 'em try
For heavy metal
We would die!

Brothers stand beside me, there's a battle on
Know my words are true
There's a battle for true metal
They're marching; they're marching on
Me and you

Ten thousand strong are here tonight
With twenty thousand fists up in the air
The power of true metal's calling you
It's everywhere

Hold your head up high
Raise your fist up in the air
Play metal louder than hell
Louder than hell

They can't stop us
Let 'em try
For heavy metal
We would die!

1. The Lord Of Steel
In the nights
We take flights
Witness the sites
The power and glory of steel
I fought and died
Lived many lives before
I am immortal like my sword
I kneel to no one except the lord
And my lord is steel
If you see me you just passed your time
To the hills you can run but not hide
Blood and death are wherever i ride
Armed for battle the lord on my side
Stand and face the lord of steel
The lord of steel
In the eyes of the lord you have sinned
Let your punishment begin
Only by death you atone
You shall not die alone
For the glory of battle
I will fight until i die
Live one day as an eagle
Or a lifetime as a fly
Like a candle burning
The wheels of time are turning
The lord of steel commands you
To die by my hand
Stand and fight the lord of steel
Time to face the lord of steel

2. Manowarriors
Hear a rollin thunder
When we come across the land
Feel the ground a shaking
Start to understand
Sons of thunder
More than just a band
Kings of metal
Loudest in the land
Never gonna change our style
Gonna play tonight for quite a while
In heavy metal we believe
If you don’t like it time to leave
Manowarriors raise your hands
We fight for metal
Manowarriors raise your hands
Our fight is real
We do just what we feel
Sons of steel
We come from different countries
With metal and with might
We drink a lot of beers
And play our metal loud at night
Fly the flag of metal
Brothers all the same
Born to live for metal
It ain’t no game
Never gonna change our style
Gonna play tonight for quite a while
In heavy metal we believe
If you don’t like it time to leave
Manowarriors raise your hands
We fight for metal
Manowarriors raise your hands
Our fight is real
We do just what we feel
Sons of steel
Sons of thunder
More than just a band
Kings of metal
Loudest in the land
Never gonna change our style
Gonna play tonight for quite a while
In heavy metal we believe
If you don’t like it time to leave
Manowarriors raise your hands
We fight for metal
Manowarriors raise your hands
Our fight is real

3. Born In A Grave
A gift of life born in a grave
Never to die
A soul that will never be saved
That will never see light
While the world is sleeping
We all fly
In the daylight silence keeping
We wait for the night
When the day ends life begins
When the shadows take light
For hundreds of years
We are your fears
We never will die
When the light goes away
We come out to play
Innocence lost and a demon within
Forgive me father, yes i have sinned
I will never be holy
I will never be saved
This was the gift on the day
I was born in a grave
Basking in the moonlight
Wolves will howl
And the bats will fly
You never knew
We were watching
Lifeless inside
For the blood is the life
The gift of the night
That has kept us alive
For thousands of years
We lived in your tears
And we never will die
When the light goes away
We come out to play
Innocence lost and a demon within
Forgive me father yes i have sinned
I will never be holy
I will never be saved
This was my gift on the day
I was born in a grave

4. Righteous Glory
She is watching
From on high
She knows who lives or dies
She will take me to the sky
Should darkness be my fate
Then let me fall among brave
In battle i shall die
In righteous glory i abide
In righteous glory she’ll come to me tonight
She will carry me across the other side
My brothers wait
Odin knows my name
In the hall of the slain
She takes me through the clouds
To another place and time
Holds me in her arms
Immortal and divine
On hooves of thunder
Her white horse parts the sky
Take me to valhalla
Valkyrie mine

5. Touch The Sky
Thunder touched my soul
I heard a call all should know
It’s my time i’m alive
Some will come some will go
But most will never know
That greatness lives inside
Like the night turns into day
Doesn’t matter what they say
My will is strong as a mountain’s high
I feel so tall i can touch the sky
Speak your mind, put me down
Say your prayers when i’m around
I live the life i’m not passing by
Shorn of hopes and dreams
I don’t buy their foolish schemes
I just walk on by
I was born with a hero’s soul
If you got one then you know
Reach my hand where the eagles fly
I feel so tall i can touch the sky

6. Black List
See the writings on the wall
If you can read
There’s a black list
Got one name and it’s me
Yea i got no invitation
But i won’t leave
Gonna keep on fighting
For everything that’s me
It’s my life
I’m living free
Ain’t nobody nowhere
Got no chains on me
See the writings on the wall
If you can read
There’s a black list
Got one name and it’s me
Yea i got no invitation
But i won’t leave
Gonna keep on fighting
For everything that’s me
If you don’t like me - tough, you better leave
Keep on fighting for the things i believe
See the writings on the wall
If you can read
There’s a black list
Got one name and it’s me
Yea i got no invitation
But i won’t leave
Gonna keep on fighting
For everything that’s me
Gonna fight for all the things
That make me breathe
And if you don’t like it - tough
You better leave

7. Expendable
I get professional pay
To make people go away
They got nothing to say
I’m expendable that’s my claim to fame
I’m expendable don’t have to know my name
Take a look into my dark side
Oh that’s a window to my soul
Your watching on the outside
Yea that’s all you people know
So bring a knife or a gun
And i’ll show you what their for
Both of them are fun
When the raven’s at your door
I’m expendable that’s my claim to fame
I’m expendable don’t have to know my name
Cause i will survive
With no one left around me
Cause your all gonna die
Together we ride
With vengeance inside
For our brother who died
We got blood on our minds
No we may not return
But many will burn
With a story to tell
How we took them to hell
I’m expendable that’s my claim to fame
I’m expendable don’t have to know my name

8. El Gringo
Don't look for me in Heaven
Don't look for me in Hell
Never taking me a live
I've got no soul to sell.

Don't look for me in prison
Don't try to save my soul
I'm a man without a country
And I've got no place to go.

You can say I'm just a gringo
You can say I'm just a man
I live outside the law
Doing anything I can.

I keep the laws I make
And I break the laws you keep.
I'm living on the edge.
Living on the street

Don't look for me in Heaven
Don't look for me in Hell
Never taking me alive
I've got no soul to sell.

Don't look for me in prison
Don't try to save my soul
I'm a man without a country
And I've got no place to go.

Each day I fight to live
I fight to stay alive.
Don't get in my way
Unless you want to die.

One who stands tall
Never stands alone.

[Solo]

Don't look for me in Heaven
Don't look for me in Hell
Never taking me alive
I've got no soul to sell.

Don't look for me in prison
Don't try to save my soul
I'm a man without a country
And I've got no place to go.

You can say I'm just a gringo
You can say I'm just a man
I live outside the law
Doing anything I can.

I keep the laws I make
And I break the laws you keep.
I'm living on the edge.
Living on the street.

Don't look for me in Heaven
Don't look for me in Hell
Never taking me alive
I've got no soul to sell.

Don't look for me in prison
Don't try to save my soul
I'm a man without a country
And I've got no place to go.

9. Annihilation
Another lie
Time to die
Another day
Blown away
Another scam
Show you who i am
Another day
Blown away
Hand of justice
Soon will be falling
Vengeance thine
Lord of steel
Annihilation
They will never win this fight
We have the power and the might
We have the sacred right
Feel the power here tonight
Hand of justice
Soon will be falling
Vengeance thine
Lord of steel
Annihilation
Live the life we truly feel
Fighting for the lord of steel
Heavy metal is my life
Heavy metal will never die

10. Hail, Kill And Die
On hymns of battle we rode to glory
Hail england did we
By the sign of the hammer
We fought the world
Kings of metal to be
Louder than hell
Warriors of the world
Now gods of war
Stand our ground knights immortal
For metal once more
Hail kill and die
On this ground for death and glory
Are all who believe
Blood and steel bound together
In a fight to be free
We will arm the just
And grind to dust
Those who deny
Our sacred right
Of glory and might
We shall survive
Hail kill and die
Hail kill and die
Dark avengers armed with hatred
Black arrows and wings
By the hammer of thor
A holy war
For the crown and the ring
We ride the dragon and wield the power
To fight til we die
Sons of odin stand so tall
We all touch the sky
Hail kill and die

1. Thunder In The sky
[Joey DeMaio, Karl Logan]

If I had a name it has long been forgotten
Was I ever borm from who am I begotten
I walk into a storm white fire burns me
Death in every stop
A world of pain thatn learns me

When you see my eyes
the ground is shaking
your bones are breaking
When you see my eyes
there's thunder in the sky
and soon your gonna die

I will fight the curse
of the universe that damns me
Am I alive or dead
Among the gods and men
A man beast

Hammer in my hand
not the son of man burns me
Beyond the cold and pain
thunder wind and rain learns me

When you see my eyes
the ground is shaking
your bones are breaking
When you see my eyes
there's thunder in the sky
and soon your gonna die

How the cold wind
cuts me like a knife
filled with empatiness
Fighting for my life
thrust into a world
of pain and holy rage
So prepare to die
when you see the tunder in the sky
When you see my eyes
the ground is shaking
When you see my eyes
your bones are breaking
When you see my eyes
there's thunder in the sky
and soon your gonna die
When you see thunder

2. Let The Gods Decide
[Joey DeMaio, Karl Logan]

Warriors take the field
The battlefield of life
You cannot run
You cannot hide

I am the keeper of the laws
Decided by the Gods

Only one of us will win
and return to fight again

I am the keeper of the laws
Decided by the Gods

Our ancestors cheer
from far beyond the grave
One will survive
Face me
Then let the Gods decide

I've sworn an oath in blood to defend the land
and all who wish to test their steel well here I am

I am the keeper of the laws
Decided by the Gods

Our ancestors cheer
from far beyond the grave
One will survive
Face me
Then let the Gods decide

3. Father
[Joey DeMaio]

When I was small
You took me by the hand
Father you should know
I finally understand

You taught me wrong from right
And how to live
You gave the greatest gift
That one could give

You never let me down
You made me strong
When I made mistakes
When I was wrong

Some days we'd laugh
And some days we'd fight
Somehow you knew one day
I'd say you were right

You're with me
In every word I say
In every hour
Of every single day
In all I do
I'm just a part of you

You lived your life for us
That was your plan
Those hands that never take
They worked the land
Hands that never take
Can only give
And because of you
I know how to live

You're with me
In every word I say
In every hour
Of every single day
In all I do
I'm just a part of you

Father just one thing
You always knew
Every word you said to me was true

4. Die With Honor
[Joey DeMaio]

If I Should Return
With My Body On My Shield
Tell My Son I Chose To Die Than Yield
Though My Life May Soon Be Gone
I Hope You'll Carry On
Remember Me As One Who Would Not Kneel

Fight With Blood
Fight With Steel
Die With Honor
Never Yield
Fearless Hearts
Filled With Pride
Into Glory We Shall Ride
Into Glory We Shall Ride

I Am Driven On In The Face Of All Despair
Trust In Steel You Will Find Me There
A Sinner's Fate Awaits Me
But My Vision Guides Me On
I Will Not Stray
From The Path I'm Set Upon

I'll Fight With Blood
Fight With Steel
Die With Honor
Never Yield
Fearless Hearts
Filled With Pride
Into Glory We Shall Ride
Into Glory We Shall Ride

If I Do Not Return
Bring My Body On My Shield
Tell My Son I Chose To Die
I Chose To Die Than Yield

Fight With Blood
Fight With Steel
Die With Honor
Never Yield
Fearless Hearts
Filled With Pride
Into Glory We Shall Ride

Fight With Blood
Fight With Steel
Die With Honor
Never Yield
Fearless Hearts
Filled With Pride
Into Glory We Shall Ride

Fight With Blood
Fight With Steel
Die With Honor
Never Yield
Fearless Hearts
Filled With Pride
Into Glory We Shall Ride
I'll Die Fighting With My Brothers Side By Side

5. The Crown And The Ring (Lament Of The Kings) (Metal Version)
[Joey DeMaio]

From a battle I've come
To a battle I ride
Blazing up to the sky
Chains of fate
Hold a fiery stride
I'll see you again when I die

High and mighty alone we are kings
Whirlwinds of fire we ride
Providence brought us the crown and the ring
Covered with blood and our pride

Heroes await me
My enemies ride fast
Knowing not this ride's their last
Saddle my horse as I drink my last ale
Bow string and steel will prevail

High and mighty alone we are kings
Whirlwinds of fire we ride
Providence brought us the crown and the ring
Covered with blood and our pride

Odin, I await thee
Your true son am I
I hail you now as I die
I pledge you my sword and to no man I kneel
Ours is the kingdom of steel

High and mighty alone we are kings
Whirlwinds of fire we ride
Providence brought us the crown and the ring
Covered with blood and our pride

6. God Or Man
[Joey DeMaio, Karl Logan]

I arrive a stranger in this land and
Those who seek me their Blood will wash the land
They who need me now reach out their hand
And If she heals me will I be God or Man

Tell Me
Will I live or Die
Then tell me Why
Tell me who I am
God or Man

Step Aside
Where I ride
Or you will die

My protection I give to those in need
Mother, Son and Daughter and Father will be free
from the chains of death upon them
I shall end their misery
With Blood upon my Hammer
Now the wolves of men shall bleed

Tell Me
Will I live or Die
Then tell me Why
Now tell me who I am
God or Man

Step Aside
Where I ride
Or you will die

I'm Alive
And I know Why
Cause of Lies
For you will die

You'll know the curse of my pain
Thunder and Rain

My protection I give to those in need
Mother, Son and Daughter and Father will be free
From the chains of death upon them
I shall end their misery
With Blood upon my Hammer
Now the wolves of men shall bleed

Step Aside
Where I ride
Step Aside
Or you will die

I'm Alive
And I know Why
Cause of Lies
You will die

1. Destiny Calls
Who holds the secret?
Who sets my destiny?
When will I find out?
What lies in the path for me?
Who bears this knowledge?
The secrets of all to be
Foretell my future
Is the answer inside to see?

So I stand up and shout at the world
For my questions to be
But the powers are out of my reach
So here I am, still right back from the start

Destiny's calling leaving my future to be
Destiny's calling, screaming in anger,
my thoughts are out of reach
I hold my soul inside of my hands
The future is my past

Who'll light my way now?
Now that I stand alone
My past still haunts me
My friend is my enemy

2. The Iron Force
Strike the anvil and forge the steel
See the iron glow like fire
Create our armour, provide us all
Give us the power to foresee our fate

Oh the journey might long and hard
Magical wonders will lead us there
And by the powers that we hold in hand
Forged steel in a time of war,
feel the rage and the strike of the Iron Force

Lay down your magic, lay down your arms
Bring us message of the fight we won
See us coming, through the fire
Stand united for the ones we lost

Brothers unite and fight for the justice
Honour for all and never give in
Fight till the end, protecting the crown
Honour for all, till we fall will fall 
And feel the rage and the strike of the iron sword

3. Ride On
Thundering down over valleys and hills
Onward they ride, always side by side 
The legend tells about the templars, 
The mighty men, who walk in the shadows
There's blood on their blades, swords made of steel
Guardians of man, always fight for the right
The legend speaks about their coming, 
The mighty men, they live on forevermore

See them ride, emerge out of the sun
They will vanish in haze
Hear them come, emerge out of dark
They will never give in

Ride on, through the winds of time
Ride on, through the night

Leaving their preys with a mark of the good
They hunt down in rage, veil them in death
In the name of the righteous, in justice
They will serve the gods

Call for the force, and shout out through the night
Seek and do what is right
See them come, emerge out of the dark
They will never give in

4. Free At Last
Hear the voices inside of our minds now
Their message is leading the way 
Into the abyss we fall, we're standing at the edge
We're the prisoners inside of our own dreams 
Where the masters are holding the keys
Battling to save our souls, will we ever be set free?

We'll be free at last, if we stand till the end
We'll be free at last, if we stand as one
While all we knew has come to end, we'll be free at last

They're holding our souls in control now
We're lost in this maze of our minds
Fighting for our survival, striking back with force
We're trapped inside of this nightmare
We sense the light up ahead
Out from the abyss we go, rise up from beyond

5. Hold On To The Flame
It's been told about the mighty land,
The sun is never setting from the sky
Gold is washed up on the shore, to a shifting sand
The dream about the day when I'll never die
Charging through the open sea, no signs to lead the way
Wind will shift and carry us at hand

We feel the walls are closing in
The tide will take a turn, will make us drift ashore

Keep on holding on, Keep on holding to the flame
And life will go on
Keep on holding on, Keep holding 
Life will still go on

Holding on to promises and what the legends say
We will see the shore of our land
Skyline meets an open bay, Illusions might betray
Onward to the land of mystery

6. Eternity Holds
Long ago in an ancient time
Might men would gather
To witness what the prophet would proclaim
He spoke of powers and endless might
The gift of a second sight
See all the secrets in the unknown

Ride the storm, ride to be
Infinity lies open to read

Eternity Holds

It would blacken the sun forever
Magic will prevail
It makes the sky burst into flames
Speak the words of the mystery
And the world will come to fall
It's their will, their time has come to stay

7. When Fire Comes To Ice
Long before time when darkness 
was ruling the world
And in the shelter of night when the wicked
would gather again so see through the eyes of
the future they put on the spell In turn to gain 
in the powers they wait for the sign
It's a wicked game that the bravest 
would dread to fight 
Only for one man that's sent to end raging madness

Oh... When fire comes to ice
Oh... When fire comes to ice, then you will burn

Chained by the powers of magic,
they're loosing control 
Stare through the eyes of the
death and speak the words

8. The Legend Lives On
"Look at me, I am a dying man. 
My son, I can no longer watch over you. 
All I know, I have passed onto you, 
as you will for others. 
It is my gift to you. Leave on your own, 
leave this all behind. 
You bear the powers of a second sight, 
you hold the courage to believe. 
No swords, no magic, no spell can touch what you own." 

Now you stand alone, I leave my throne for you
Seek and find the truth, my mission here is done
Set your aims up high, you bear the second sight
I now pass onto you the knowledge of the wise

You were the firstborn and chosen to be king
Lead your troops, and I'll be there

Your legend lives on
Your name is carved in stone
The story of the chosen one, one couraged to believe
It's the destiny of bringing it all home
Holds the sense of time to come
In my name, the legend lives on

My names says victory, so I ride ahead of all
My mission will not fail, for vengence is my thirst
Return with and filled with calm and glorois to be 
Now we stand as one and the legend will live on

On the winds rides the memory
Of your time long gone

9. The King's Command
A knight is sworn to valour
And his heart knows only only virtue
His blade defends the helpless
And his might upholds the weak
Loyal to his kingdom
When the word of war goes out
Born to serve the nobel
When Kings and Queens request

Mount horse and head away
Sharpened steel, crossing blades, 
Before fear, do your work 

The King's command 
His word will be the law that we command 
The King's command

Out into the battlefield
Whoose blood will stain the ground?
Courage and our bravery 
Protects the borderlines
Plunging our steel into the hearts of enemy May our troops be many, 
for the fight has just begun

Heed the command
Never surrender
Fight till the death
Never break the oath.

10. Unholy Powers
Long before the number is at hand
The conjuring will take it all again
The prophecy is telling us of wisadry and fear
It's time to seek and haunt the land

In darkness they will gather once again
The wisdom might conceal or gain

Unholy powers are taking control
When the spell of the night's setting in
Unholy powers, we're all cast aside
Cause the night of the witch never ends

In the time when darkness now ruled the world again
After all was done, and laid to waste
The conjuring will take its toll and start it all
Death will be the outcome in this spell

Stand tall fight the force, the night will come to fall
Stand tall fight them all, unholy powers are taking control

11. Glorius
My hands are tied here, in the darkness
I'll never find out what went wrong
I'm being punished, and sent to die
These cold and icy walls will end my life

In the dungeon where the holy rule
Can someone ever ease the cross I bear

And my death will be Glorius
When my mission is done
And my death will be glorious
My task is complete, my journey will come to end

Their fate control them, I'll never loose
Te chains will hold me, hold me to the ground
I hold the answer, inside my mind
But in this prison I'll see the end

NOCTURNAL RITES LYRICS


1. Sword Of Steel
Riding out in darkness 
Hoarding no fear 
Toward horizons 
Dyed in black 
We drew the circle once again 
Around the pentagram 
Our swords drip in crimson 
To conjure the one 
Sign of evil Rides us through 
We see the flames of hell arise 
As we open the gates 

Sword of stell must be held up high 
Somber shades of death we ride 
Sword of steel will laude the one 
Sword of steel will crack the sky 

For aye the one will rise in shadows 
He holds the key to infinity 
Open the gates, swing my sword up high 
Sword of steel alk in darkened vapour 
Clad in veils of night 
Unholy powers will rise again 
We complete the ceremony 
To hail-side by side

2. Skyline Flame
Lachrymose they saw him leaving 
Riding along the skyline flame 
His shreiks shall forever echo 
Over valleys and hills 
Mesmerized by the evil 
Let the imperial one rule 
Ornated in blood we stand 
And in his eyes shone victory 

In from the darkness he'll return 
To his fortress 
Standing here with pride 
The skyline flame 

Paralyzed by the dark one 
Riding along the skyline flame 
The one who leads us in darkness 
And takes us to the flaming depths 
We have seen the abyss 
We crave its infernal deep 
We light our candles 
And let them light the way

3. Black Death
The countess was laughing 
She looked out the plague from her throne 
By the gate in the darkness 
The crowd was screaming in pain 
Cursed of sickness by starving 
People dying slow 
They are burning their bodies, the victims 
The plague got in hold 

The plague is getting in its hold 
There is no way to escape 
The old man conquered her throne 
So it's been told 

A new day was rising 
The unknown came riding along 
An old man with power and strength 
To conquer the throne 
In shelter of darkness 
The people were standing strong 
By their leader the old man 
They are hunting the countess down

4. In A Time Of Blood And Fire
In a time of blood and fire 
Before the break of dawn 
Mighty swords were held to the sky 
In a land that rules by darkness 
Of evil and fire spawned 
Damnation now eclipsed the sun 

As black horsemen rode along with 
Death at their side 
So the scene of death rose the winds 
In black blood they shall baptise 
And under a black star the demon will rise 

In a time of blood and fire 
They rode across the lands 
In a time of blood and fire 
Under wings of yore they shelter 

A thousand years have passed now 
Oh, so grim and dark 
Now men must laude the demon's mark 
Servants of unholy powers 
In darkness must confide 
To the abyss in the darkness they descend

5. Dawnspell
The Spell of the dawn has been cast 
Like the storm rides the wind 
It clouds darkness and evil 
To come on strong again 
It follows the sign of the one 
The bringer of thunder and storm 
Voices of darkness now call out 
The one to ride again 

Riding out instorm under cover 
Look out for the dawn and its power 
The spell is cast as it rides the wind 
Standing tall holy defenders 
Come on strong before the dawn 
And the night will come and spell will 
Rise again 

The curse of the spell has brought fear 
To the people again 
They run from the curse for they dread 
The spell of dawn they've seen 
There is no way to run from the spell 
The bringer of thunder and storm 
Voices of darkness anew called out 
And the ones they rode again

6. Lay Of Ennui
Hear us prince of darkness 
Guide us to our dreams 
To hold the seven keys 
To rule the world beneath 
We crave the blackest love 
As we gaze on through the gate 
Now thy name we call out 
Give us lord of evil 
Thy touch shall atone 
Through the sea of flames 
The seven gates we see 
We await the black salvation 
We light the thirteen candles 
Now thy name we call out 

Lay of ennui king of the lore 
Lay of ennui hear our call 
Lay of ennui prince of the darkness 
Lay of ennui we abide 

Through the darkest night 
Guide us to our dreamsow in front of thee 
But you won't hear 
As the flames of evil arose 
We draw the sign in the blood 
Now thy name we call out

7. Winds Of Death
Through the winds of death we ride 
I swing my sword up high 
You'll taste my steel, I won't abide 
Cause you know you are gonna die 

Clad in leather and chains we slay 
We fight for king and land 
We'll burn your homes and bring you dismay 
With our vast swords in hand 

Glory, victory, forever hail 

Howl in mighty rage 
Clad the sky bleak 
Claw the hide of enemy 
Hail the winds of death 

We spread the ashes of your dead 
There is nothing left to save 
We sear the ground where they bled 
We pledge doom upon your grave 

Make them cry and bleed 
The storm shall howl and now descend 
Hordes of shade, they call, they heed 
They call, they heed

8. Rest In Peace
Called out to load the ships 
They are sailing at dawn 
With hundred men at their side 
Flames from a distance 
Lighting up the sky 
And the warriors will rise 
Armed with swords and arrows 
Battle begins 
They will fight for their pride 
The sound of steel echoes in the night 
The wind cries out loud 

Into the night they are calling 
To the ones dying brave 
May they now rest in peace 
Forever the battle is won 

Twenty of the men are 
Slowly going down 
But the treasures are found 
Back on the ship, the survivors 
Scream out - the battle is won 
The twenty men who couldn't 
Make it to share their victory 
May they now rest in peace 
On the dragonisle, they are buried 
Side by side 
Hail to their pride

9. Dragonisle
By the power of our father's rusty 
swords 
We are standing proud and strong 
Under banner and king our soil 
Drinks blood of the enemy 
From here we see through the raven's eyes 
We ride the winds of north 
And from cups of silver we drink from 
The dragon's blood 

Standing tall 
STAND TALL 
To fight them all 
FIGHT THEM ALL 
For Dragonisle 

Through the Seven winds of Wrath we 
Called 
Called up to the gods 
With steel at our sides we defend the 
dragonisle 
Baptised in the dragon's blood 
We hail our king with pride 
And in the fire, for aye one with the king

NOCTURNAL RITES LYRICS


1. Eyes Of The Dead
A mind of its own, spawn out of fire
The demon becomes a God
A child, two-faced and innocent
Transcending
Control, fragments of nothing
Enslaving, reversed humane
Empires made out of nothing but air
Creation fails

Hungry he laughs at us all
Sacred is noyhing no more

In the eyes of the dead, at the edge of the night
In an oath of blood we are sacred
In the eyes of the dead, still nothing revealed
The wounds they still bleed, and won't heal

Blood in the sands, slaves to the hunger
Heaven denies them all
A god, a dome for its pleasures and lust
Possession
The falls prophets of nothing
Promise but take it back
The one, the futile and venomous son
Will torture

2. Shadowland
What was the light that I saw before me
As I opened my eyes
Behold, the dream opens up
What's the thing that I feel inside me
I can tell what will come
What has becomes of us all

Rise, Shadowland
A world of ice
A destiny, the final key
The dream has come alive
Rise up again
Open, Shadowland
A dream to be, eternally

Open, Shadowland

What's the thing that has come to haunt me
The dream comes alive
Inside the gateway of time
At the dead lake of bitter waters
The future reveals
I see the end of the world

3. Invincible
Across the desert plains
They come as though invincible
Out of a fallen land they walk away
Over the shallow seas
With bleeding hands they carry on
Towards the distance in the open sea

New dawn raging
The whips and chains are one
Out of a land without a reign

They come as one, as one they go
Out of the wasteland
No one to fall, Invincible
They will return

Proclaim awakening
To hail a god perpetual
A war in heaven knows no victory

4. Revelation
Now the sky opens up before my eyes
The vision blinds me
On the bolts of fire cast upon the earth
Out, out of the void the riders come
Through hail and flashes
In the distance hear the seventh horn still sound

No one is innocent
No, I will return again

The sky divides in two
The final revelation
Out of the void, see the riders emerge
The prophec is true
The final revelation
Feel the fire, as it's cast upon the world

No ripples upon the sea of glass
The shrine is open
As I wait the final sacring of my soul
I, I open the scroll and know my fate
The peals of thunder
When I know the secret of the seven seals

5. Never Die
Hear the calling
From the shadows in the deep
Won't surrender
We are standing at the edge
They call for arms and we'll stand our ground
It's neverending
When the power comes alive
Never falling
The truth is in our hearts
Rise up and stare the beast in the eyes

Wandering souls, never betray
The last of our kind, our eyes are ablaze

We'll never die
NEVER DIE
We're masters of the earth, coming alive
We'll never die
NEVER DIE
We're masters of eternity, fighting a world to be

Another aeon
And the endless sands of time
Everflowing
We rise above them all
Witch how the world turns into our throne

6. Underworld
An entity, living inside me
Scraped away, the flesh from my bones
Come on in and feel on my hunger
Welcome to my underworld
Come on in and lust in the darkness
Grasp away the skin from my face
Be the mask, defer to the master
I feel the lesion tainting me

Will the faces reader
Will the mask reveal
Will I bleed in splendour
How this silence is killing me
(In this silent underworld)

Don't defy, the mind is the altar
Raped away, in pretends to be me
Hollow soul, the beacon is fading
Welcome to the sin divide
Desecrate, the memories will haunt me
I am God, the festering wound
Empty eyes, a stare that still beckons
I feel its will, it's tempting me

Save my soul, give me peace
Let me through this hole, I'm dying
My soul is gone, you're killing me

7. Vengeance
Into the void, an image of nothing is fading
The venomous grey, dissolves into pieces of me
The carrion calls, entices the pest, they're falling
The Charon he waits
But no one can see the flames at sea

I'll have my vengeance
My kingdom come
I speak in silence
Last mind astray, lead me the way

Flames over ice, the visions are false
Wiat for my vengeance
See how it dies, outside the walls
The memory purged from my eyes
My vengeance calls

Aeons ignite, inflicting the visions forsaken
Begotten in sin
The womb holds the souls that will be
The ravenous hole, swallows the dirt it has taken
Even in death, a dead man is never free

8. Faceless God
A darkened room, a blackened hole
A septic grain turns the flesh into sand
The night is slain, the light is gone
I feel, how the vision fails me
Let them bleed, then suck them dry
A severed dream turns will to submission
This dying world, will bring rebirth
They kill, they kill for pleasure

The pathway is open
A choice must be made
I'm not afraid
Call out my name

Faceless god
A soul for a crown
His eyes are the color of blood
A life for a throne
Faceless God

Rejoice in sin, come on in
Repent no more but the scarring remains
Poisoned sheep, the flock has died
I know, how their blood still stains me
A prophecy, it comes to life
The curtain falls and out comes the truth
Whole death awaits, the memory comes
I know how the vision failed me

9. Birth Of Chaos
Another genocide, a masterplan foresaw the fall
A resurrection reversed
There's a brave new world, a soulless sphere that penetrates
It's the seal to our fate

Your gods have failed
Our will be done

The fiery chains that held but cut the fatal thread at last
Condemned eternities pass
Another motor spins, machinery of hate begins
And still crumbles and grinds

Black souls that seem unreal
Cold empty hearts
The formless hollow shells of man

Time, times of evil
The birth of chaos, regain of the earth
Time, times of evil
The birth of chaos reborn

The endless pain begins and torture breeds the suffering
Another destiny fades
A second sacrifice, a last revenge of human kind
Enslave the last one alive

Strapped to the offering god
The slaves of the earth
A blank stare is all that remains
Witness their birth

10. The Watcher
Inside the earth, they scheme for the slaughter
A part of the masterplan
Forbidden to be, for no one to see
Onnocence for pain, they twist in pleasure
Spawn from a life of gods
The watcher is all, destruction befall

The final embrace
A silent scream
Eternal debase, deceive or prevail

We rot to the core, the final ambition
The hunger begins to grow
Oblivious one, the fall has begun

The final embrace
A silent scream
The presence evolves, the colony grows

Fates are falling, names in stone
Final calling, the watcher of the fall
Fates are falling, rise or fall
Final calling, the watcher in us all

1. New World Messiah
Alone in a world of silence, I'm crawling in you
I won't ever betray your trust, feel me - I subdue
Trust you seek, and you'll find messiah
Take the stone 'round your neck away
Don't you ever display my fear
I'm yours - so come what may

Oh, and I opened the door
The cold's forevermore
So don't you see, you are your own enemy

So I'll fight, stand or fall
Choose my fate, feel how it's calling to us all
Stand or fall, the new world messiah
And the dawn of man

There are times when beckons to me,
Grips my throat and just pulls me in
Here I am but a shadow's worth, to wash away my sins

2. Against The World
They taught him right and waht to believe
How to live by the rules
They all restrained his hungry heart
With time he would conceive

Walked the path of a righteous man
Taught him how to belong
A winding road, and now it seems

No, the world is on my shoulders
I'm the one against the world
The one they lead astray
But I'll know till my dying day
I'm the only one against the world

Never stray from our way of life
Vent your anger within
Betrayal, it makes a bitter man
The truth cuts like knives

Now look at him and what he's become
He still kneels for them all
A broken pawn, about to fall

There he stands alone again
While his world becomes unreal
Forever astray

3. Avalon
In the void, long before time, the entity broke into five
The elements of life once came alive
Genesis, womb of the world, god of time
Bringer of all
Spring out of the dark, behold the light

Stand up in a land of flames
Gods at war, battle forevermore

Rise, Avalon
From the veil of mystery
The birth of time will soon begin
For all to see
Rise, Avalon
While tomorrow fades away
Welcome to the promised land
As all towers fall

Brave New World rise to the sky
The wonders of man crumble and fall
Man appointing Gods, unfold our fear

4. Awakening
I'll end my journey here
Because time and tide it waits for no man
There's something strange in me
I see the things that should not be
It's all a mindless game
Trapped inside the walls I built
Try to pull them down
But something stops me

Then the feeling comes alive
I can't hold it any more
Enemy...  Is it you

End of the line, walking alone
In this world of my own
Demons of guilt, battle to win
This is my awakening

There's no turning back
There's nothing to awaken me
Insanity my friend
I can feel your gripping hand
To roam the earth alive
But feel as if you're dead and dreaming
Try to break away, but nothing helps me

5. Egyptica
How many miles of endless sand
Must we drag your stones into this wasteland?
How many years in endless pain
Must we toil under your reign?

Just like in Babylon, no glory lasts forever
The icon is not, what it seems to be
No more slavery, no you're not heaven sent
Nothing stands alone, feel the endless pain
In Egyptica

Here we raise your tower high
Still an infant, but divine in our eyes
After years still flesh and blood
They said he would become a god

6. Break Away
Don't ever run, and live a lie
Rise above it all
Spread your wings to fly

Don't ever climb, the ship of fools
Sailing on and on
Face the truth

Hear the cry, destiny calling you again
Point the way, allow you to fly away
Following the silent voice within

Break away, rise anew
By leaving the memory behind you
Break away, carry on
Only the strong will live on

Your darkest hour, the final day
Looks you in the eye
Turn and walk away

Blackened soul, a heart of stone
Clown behind the mask
Let it out

7. End Of Days
Have you seen the fall of the world
How blood stains the ground at our feet
Mankind kills in the name of God
Holy vengeance, lies, and deceit
Have you seen the fall of man
How wounded he crawls through the mud
Dust and bones still cover the soil
While we measure our wages in blood

We've lost the our way, the end of the rope
Our final day
We'll never learn, bridges still burn

The end of days, now feel how we lost our way
Forgive the sins of those before
And turn the lies away
With eyes ablaze, no witness our end of days
A fading world for all to see, unfold the final decree

Dreams are spun in ivory towers
And fear is the game we learn
See the world, its barren soil
The shackles that hold us will burn

It feels like we fade away
The world is dark and burning
We know, it's coming near
This is the end of days

8. The Flame Will Never Die
The painting is fading now
The color's wearing thin
Her eyes in the broken glass
A stare that chills within
She cries only crimson tears
The eyes are burning with fire
Once beleived, made her strong
Once deceived made her wrong

Sorrow and pain
Closed her eyes to see through the unknown
Nothing's in vain, 'cuz the flame
The flame will ever die

The lines in her ashen face
Reveal a heart torn asunder
Twisted ones,bring the pain
Throw your first stone again

9. One Nation
The world was growing colder
They watched from far away
How man was weakened still
In his final day
How fear became his shadow
The feeble lead the blind
Another hell begins
You're next in line

From here we see forever, this place is ours you know
Our time is drawing near

One nation, one world
And forevermore, into an everlasting war
One nation, one world
And we heard the call, the future lies within our hands

Another shiny empire
Of evil come divine
Built your house on sand, it's over now

Time has come at last
Killing fields, gone at last and forevermore

10. Nightmare
To wake and wipe the sweat away
Like so many times before
Pray to see the light of day
There's something wicked in us all
We meet inside our dreams
When awake we can't recall

No sleep till dawn
To wander endlessly, set us free
Twilight, dream time defines our glory
In silence we conquer it all
Midnight, dream time conceals the story
We're alive in a nightmare

His idle hands, when aware
We all chant the rhyme in fear
Speak the killing words again
Dream maker. sing your little tune
Make us dance to what you play
Dream time is coming soon

11. Another Storm
[Japanese Bonus Track]

I'ts getting hard to breathe, with a devil on my back
I''m tired, lost and confused
It feels like all is gone, I'm brought down to my knees
You pull me away without warning

My eyes are furious
But nothing is ever what it seems

Another storm is over
Make me see, or leave me be
Another storm is over
They're carving my name in stone
As I walk out into the storm

My mind's at war again, I'm waiting for the end
Tying to break out of here
It feels like all is lost, nothing to attain
It's always trying to drain me

12. Save Us
[Japanese Bonus Track]

Here we are, a dying breed for ever more
Will we ever see the day?
Cast away, thrown into to the underworld
It's time to rise up from the dark and see the light

Save us, Save us
From this pain and misery, is this our destiny?
Save us, Save us
Chaos and despair, get us out of here

Silently, we close our eyes and meet again
Inside this prison full of souls
Wide awake, no one keeps this flame alive
We know we're trapped inside this hell forever more

Save us, Save us
From this pain and misery, is this our destiny?
Save us, Save us
Chaos and despair, get us out of here

Is there a light ahead, leading out here
Will we ever see the day?
It's coming closer now, the light begins to shift
Is this real or is it dream

1. Afterlife
I am the vengeance, a link between the worlds
Souring in legions, controller of all
I am the substance of the chaos
There's one dominion, an evil and divine
Spawn the inferno, oblivion calls
Don't look for sanctuary coming

The end is calling
Deceive and destroy
Afterlife - revelations unveil

A blackness remains, the end of the line
Ashes of man, eye of the one divine
The blackness ascends, powers untold
The Afterlife

The heart of chaos, will manifest again
The seed of the serpent, the dagger of doom
So even death can die in deadland

The phantom's aeon
Dream is denied
Afterlife - revelations revive

2. Wake Up Dead
Ride, hell's in fury, an evil in believe
Wrath upon the dead and dreaming
Lie, sins subliminal, I twist in harmony
Blood upon my darkest day

Slit my wrist and watch me bleed
Tighten the noose around my neck
Fear the evil, turn the lights

Wake up dead
I'm falling
I can hear it whisper as I desecrate myself
Wake up dead
It's calling
Wake up dead - alive

Die, life's expendable, taking my last breath
Waiting for my death I'm grieving
Why, in the darkest hours, I can hear my call
Hell for now and evermore

The sins will not justify, the blood on my hands
I'm twisting the knife
Reality is no more, I'm waking up dead and alive

3. The Sinner's Cross
Disengage your fear
and see the devil in the eye
Rearrange the truth
and be a believer to the lie
Is there a way to find,
peace of mind in the life you life

Search the inner soul
And you'll find the rainbow's end again

Far away, far from here
Cross the river, on a shore of another time
Far away, far from here
Cross the river on the other side
There it lies, far away

Seek to find your remedy
Your life is on the wire
Living on the disbelief
Salvation is the crime

4. Hell And Back
Look the beast in the eye, set it free
The animal will be unchained
See deep within, and you'll find what you seek
The powers will lie there unbound
The eye of the mind unfolds the unreal
Open the doors that where closed
Broken the seal to a new world within
Stand in the gateway to hell

Walk through the fire, let no one stand in your way
The unknown waits in the darkness alone

I am falling fast
I'm right in the final hour
Future turns to past
Been sent to hell and back

Nailed to a cross and I spit in disgust
No way that I'll follow the blind
Broken down the shackles that fettered my mind
The devil laughs by my side

Look in my eyes, and see what I've become
Come hell, come fire, I'm not afraid - perpetual at last

5. The Sign
Hear the cry from the underworld,
to pull you under
It's the enemy, the journey ends here
Light the path throughout the night,
it's getting close
Sanctuary in a hollow void

See a sign appear in the dark
Your sould will perish in flames

The Sign of the two turns to one
No savior uo high
The promised euphoria's gone
So hell is life and death

Fell the breath inside your minde,
it prevades your soul
Hear the voices cry, through the never
Your eyes turn inside out; you're all alone now
Feel your heart explode, piece by piece

Pain, suffering just do it,
death is the blessing you seek
Your soul will be free,
Life is an endless torture,
for the mindless and weak
You're killing yourself

6. The Devil's Child
Born into sin,
a lust for the evil
Betrayed and deceived,
benn giving his number
Serpent of death, child of the darkness
A servant to torture, a slave to power

Twisting his mind, the ways of the wicked
There's no turning back

Ten thousand eyes, hiding the glory
Who's the chosen one?
Who could have known, death ws a blessing
It's the Devil's Child

The power he holds, witness the progress
His senses unfold; the choice has been made
Eyes lit with fire, a snake in disguise
Collector of souls, the work must go on

7. Genetic Distortion Sequnce
Initiate gentice distortion sequence
Commence involuntary human breakdown

Watch the reconstruction
Beginning of the end
THe world is black and burning - Man has failed
Watch the second coming
A season of decay
World elimination - Activate

Another poor example
Can we survive?
Create the perfect sample of man

Evaluate - Eliminate
Eliminate the world

Genetic evolution
Composite of a man
Obliterate the defects - Mass -produced
Commencing the distortion
Decoding what remains
Redemption and illusion - Enervate

8. Sacrifice
Trapped in a world, where nothing is real
Lost in the fires of hell
Possessed I obey, in shadows I kneel
A sacrament, venom released

I hear'em calling, gripping for my soul
Schizophrenia, the eyes of the death unfold

Tormented mind, soul of black
Lock up in chains forever
Petrified heart eases the pain
I'll be my sacrifice

Shattering world, I will not betray
Rigid I await my command
The whisper is near; it's leading the way
Death - the final demand
Turned around for another side of life

9. Temple Of The Dead
A dynasty falls, another reborn
The Pharaoh's legacy, carved into stone
IN scriptures of Re, the God of the Nile
Tell how to bury the chosen

Open the temple
Entomb the soul of the king

As the gate opened up,
and we saw the temple inside
Heard the calling from beyond,
in the temple of the dead

The new king is born, gets the white crown
Reigning in slavery, cult of the damned
The people rebel, dethroning the King
Comes withour warning, a shadow

Break the seal
Awake the soul Re
A prophecy
Then the dead arise, the dead shall arise

10. Hellenium
See them as they come, from blackened sun
Riding'cross the sky
Fear you'll be the one, hunted on the run
A refugee in mind

Dream that this blessing
Will lead you into the light
Blessed by the devil's kiss
Revealing the entrance to hell of night

Hell of night

Stare into the dark, don't look upon the face
Hiding in the night
Degenerated soul, fear it's your disgrace
Lost inside yourself

11. Okahoo
[japanese bonus]

In the fire
Where the fallen await
Blinded to all of its glory
See the fear, in the eyes of the dead
The circle's to close once again

Close you eyes for a dying world
Death's command won't betray

[chorus]
Hell, calls
A cry from the new world
The dream lasts forever
Man, falls
Into the unknown
The new generation

Hear the silence, the process of death
The mind is an opening grave
No denial, the blood turns to black
No giving in to repent

Close you eyes for a dying world
Death's command won't betray

[chorus]

Mind torture, flames burst
Cast into the fire
Act of death, stop breathing
Machines will take control

Close you eyes for a dying world
Death's command won't betray

[chorus x2]

1. A Heart As Black As Coal

2. Before We Waste Away
Welcome to the new age
Where our views are warped and bent in shape
To fit the mold, the flavor of the day
All the numb and the pacified
It's a new world the stage is yours tonight
Sign up at the dotted line
Oh... come and join the ride

Can't someone save us
We just waste away
This is the new world
It's our darkest day
We keep on building fences
When freedom's up for sale
Can't someone save us
We just waste away

Look at all the righteous
Standing tall upon their own empires
The two-faced ones so good at faking smiles
Take a look at the games we play
Another headline all the world's stage
One more to fuel the hate
Oh... It's like we waste away

Can't someone save us
We just waste away
This is the new world
It's our darkest day
We keep on building fences
When freedom's up for sale
Can't someone save us
We just waste away

Can't someone save us
We just waste away
This is the new world
It's our darkest day
We keep on building fences
When freedom's up for sale
Can't someone save us
We just waste away

Just waste away

NOCTURNAL RITES LYRICS


1. Ring Of Steel
The queen sent out a message,
she heard about the ring 
With powers that no man,
that no man would dare to face
The warrior headed north,
riding through the night alone
Searching night and day for the
secret of the ring
The secret of the legend
lives forever 
The legend brought the queen together 

In from the darkness the warrior returned
and the ring that he held in his hand,
had the powers
To freeze the world, 
while the queen would bring madness
It's the ring of steel

A new day is rising,
the queen is laughing still
The ring that she wears
it's the evil itself
The secret of the legend lives forever
The legend brought the queen together

In from the darkness the warrior returned
and the ring that he held in his hand, had the powers
To freeze the world, 
while the queen would bring madness
It's the ring of steel
The ring was founded again
by the rightful owners strong demand
The queen is laughing still out of control

2. Dark Secret
The sun fades away as a distant flame
against the sky
Beyond the clouds lies
the undiscovered truth
A realm still not known to man
and the powers it possesses
Now the time is soon at hand so beware

Destined to doom by a force of the unknown
the answer still not far away
You all may wonder what lies beyond

Passing away through the eye of the storm
Sealed up inside so untouched, so secured
In The eye of the strm lies the seceret alone
In dark deep inside, a power so strong

The sky starts dividing,
and sends its wrath down to earth
The fallen ones emerge out of the mist
With powers never seen before,
and the secret it withholds
Another victim of the secret
had come forth

Destined to doom by...

Through the eye of the storm ...

3. Test Of Time
Standing lost at a crossroad
Life is lying in my hands
Faith is calling above us
And who can tell when the world will end

Time will choose only one man
Only one must grow old
We can both see it coming
And we know, it's been told

Passing through centuries
My mind growing weaker
Whose fate will be sealed
The gift of growing old

Only the strongest one
Will make it to the end
The final gathering is at hand

The time has come, there will be one
To stand the trial and the test of time
Another lifetime is on the other side

We're the last ones standing
Only one must fall
By the sword it settles
And we know it's been told

As the sreel rings through the night
I strike the deadly wound
We both see it's coming
And I know I'm the chosen one

4. Lost In Time
I'm waking up all alone
Not knowing where I am
Is this a dream or is this time for real
Will I forget about the past

Or will I end this way

If this is the way, how will I find it
Give me a sign I'll carry on

Still lost in time 
Forever
Forever lost in time

Standing here in a world so cold
This silence makes me mad
I wander endless miles to find the truth
My future lies ahead
I got this second chance

5. The Vision
Look through the darkness the vision of life
then tell me what do you see.
A dream you believe is a life you can't see
something existis but can never be.
You will wake up but not from a dream
when you wake up it will be for real
The feeling is real and so is the pain
Wherever you go it'll be the same

You cant believe you're trapped inside.
this can't be real, wake up in time
before it's too late, beforeyou've crossed the line

Don't overlook the eye of your mind 
when the eye of that vision is a piece of another time.
Forever beware of what you dream
The vision is so closed behind.

The vision you saw the eye of your mind
a dark side of you never meant to be.
The reason of being inside of this dream
something you never tought you would see.
The fury of madness the power of dreams
You could be safe so let visions be
You hold the secret the vision inside
Keep the knowledge and seal it inside

6. Warrior's Return
Riding out in the storm
Yet the night seemed so calm
We were hundreds of men
Side by side
Still the winds blowing strong
But sheltered by faith, we rode on,
on and on

Through the mist, we went on
With steel at our sides
We would make it to the end
Side by side.
Trough the rain and the mist
Approching our goal, we would
never, never surrender.

We're standing strong
There's a war left to fight
Beware for the warriors return
With swords held up high
There's blood left to spill
Prepare for the warriors return

We could fight 'till the end
Complete the quest
'Til the victors are standing alone.
By the strike of our blades
Men would fall at our feet
We've completed the quest
once again.

We're coming home
now the battle is won
Honor for the warriors return.
Pride for the ones who died for the cause
Glory for the warriors return.

Fill the cups up with wine
Uniting our force
And cheer for the battle we've won
and pride in our hearts
We will never surrender

7. Change The World
The stillnest of the night is here 
Our brothers of the world are standing alone
To take a stand when time has come

We'll lead the revolution through the streets
The time is now to fight the world

Join our hearts in unity now brothers of all
Stand together and our voices will be heard
When all is lost and nothing is gained.
Then I will change the world

When all is done we'll stand as one
We won, our trail through life is done

We'll lead the revolution through the streets
The time is now to fight the world

Join our hearts in unity now brothers of all
Stand together and our voices will be heard
When all is lost and nothing is gained.
Then I will change the world

8. Pentagram
They set sails towards the sea
Only brave men with hearts of steel.
To embark upon the journey
And bring the treasure back.
They will head the old man's words
As he wrote so long ago
"Go and find the treasure
and live for evermore."
For thousand days they sailed
Towards a distant world.
Reaching to where heaven ends
Beyond the stars- to find the pentagram.

Now the skys fades to black
Strong winds tear the sails apart.
Above them roaring thunder
That echos in the night.
Mighty waves cast the ship aside
One hundred men go down.
Everyone but one man
That lived on to be free.

Long ago they sailed away
To a land beyond the stars.
One man brought the fortune home
And lived for evermore.

9. Eye Of The Demon
Beyond the valley lies a neverending force,
the strongest of powers ever known.
For a thousand ages they tried to get hold
of the power that lies out of reach.
No swords of magic, no powers of man
could ever break the seal of fate.
Look within yourself to find the true meaning
The end is closer than you know.

Break the silence of the storms.
Find the keys to the seventh winds.
Beyond this world lies a secret,
men would die to uncover.
But within is where we learn how to see,
where the journey begins.

Eye of the demon.

Open the eye into a neverending world
to live the dream you never knew
Fill your heart with strenght from the mind
Rise to live and never die.

10. End Of The World
The propheey tells of the powers so strong
There's no chance to be saved from the fate
There's no future for life, but the fire still burns
And the world ill soon reach its end.

All eyes of this world shall witness
The coming of the propheey.
Stand the chance, stand in faith.

It's the end, it's the end of the world
Heaven's falling down

The sun will turn black and then heaven shall fall
An earthquake is shaking the ground.
Open the seals and the secret unfolds
As we witness the fall of the earth

The sun loosing shape and heaven starts falling.
There's no chance to be saved from this fate.

11. The Curse
There's something in the dark
There's something is us all
The fear of dying has no end
the fire in our eyes
Will keep our faith alive
The burning flame will last forever

In our dreams the curse lives on and on
'Till light breaks the spell
The memory still haunts us down
All because of the curse

There's something we all know
In the past down below
That haunts our minds and dreams together
We're searching for the way
Below the unknown truth
The burning flame will last forever 

In our dreams the curse lives on and on
'Till light breaks the spell
The memory still haunts us down
All because of the curse

12. Burn In Hell
I'm a loser, it's tearing me apart
But I've got some news,
I'm not going down this time
Wake up your fools 
'cause you don't stand a chance
If I stand or fall,
I'll rise no matter what

Doomsday's bells (Doomsday's bells)
Hear the prophe's word
You're a liar and a thief,
by my hands I'll make you kneel

Burn in hell, Burn in hell
By my hands I'll make you kneel

Choke on the pieces of your past
Nowhere to run, the luck will take it's turn

Doomsday's bells (Doomsday's bells)
Hear the prophe's word
You're a liar and a thief,
by my hands I'll make you kneel

Burn in hell, Burn in hell
By my rage and fury fall

Wake up, you fools don't stand a chance
If I should fall I'll rise again.

NOCTURNAL RITES LYRICS


1. Fools Never Die
Trading their lies on the TV-screen
Telling us all what to be
Act like they're gods, egos inflated
Can't believe you'd fail to see

Other lives on the great divide
And hungry you swallow their scheme
Small-minded fools, all so conceited
Don't you know that they're never quite they seem

As weird as if a dream

Another fool, one more crossing the line
Won't believe, a mad man leads the blind
So follow your heart and hear them cry
Because fools never die

Crawl on your knees for your world to grow.
A round of applause and you go
In with the freaks, swallow our poison
Never thought you'd stoop this low

2. Never Trust
I tried to leave you
But there you are
Feeding me your point of view
So why'd you come here
To smother me
When I can't make you disappear

And you, will never betray me anymore
It's true they say, that time will tell, what parts we play

Never trust a stranger
No more trials and endless wars
Never trust a stranger
Before your final day,
Then come what may

We did it your way
Now look at me
Then tell me what you really see
I know it kills you
And I don't care
I'd like to drag you down here too

3. Still Alive
Like a thunder storm it's breaking out
Won't take another blow, and,
I'll let you know
I'll never kneel or falter
'cause you are not the only
I'm not crawling back again

I'm still alive
Though I'm old, trite and weary
And I know I'm alive enough
To stand my ground
So there is nothing to revive -
I'm still alive

I tried to wash away those filthy lies
Betrayed and lead astray,
I just walked away
In my darkest hour
I still hear you breathing
Well, you won't get the best of me

4. Something Undefined
Here we are, travelled on forever
Thought we had it all, never got that far
Carry on: tell us what we're fighting for
Free us from what we are

Why is nothing meant to last?

Forever and ever
Trying to leave it all behind
We're all afraid to walk away
Forever, wherever
Trying to find our peace of mind
Fighting for something undefined

Hollow one, on the edge of never
Thought you had it all, in the barrel of a gun
Point the way: shoot those blanks into the dark
Tell us we're moving on

In the future or the past?

Leave it all behind...

5. Our Wasted Days
Man is but a liar
A coward and a thief
The things that we aspire
And hide behind belief
We claim it's for the maker
And do his righteous deeds
It's time for all us fakers
To solely name it greed

We all know it's someone
That pulls our weight
One fate, the final hour

Brave new world, depraved new ways
While the piper plays on through our wasted days
Brave new world, still unheard
Crying out for more, I am god

Welcome age of reason
Teach us to conform
Wise men call it treason
Straying from the norm
So buy that costly promise
Shove it down your throat
Choke up on their slander
Buy that precious vote

As the clock keeps turning
We know it's over now
The walls are closing in

6. Cuts Like A Knife
There it comes the ship of nails
Down the river it's setting sails
Now I see why they're all so pale

(I carry the dead and the bizarre, I am Naglfar)

What would you recommend?
Could you help me to comprehend?
Will this mean I'm forever condemned?

(Well, that's what you get for killing your best friend)

Don't get me wrong
I killed him all right,
But he stabbed me first
I'm not the one, but that's not the worst...

It cuts like a knife
(An eye for an eye)
It cuts like a knife
(I've come for your life)

I don't know, what to do
Can't you see what I'm going through?
Here I am, if I only knew

(I'm back to reign again)

7. End Of Our Rope
I've been too blind to see
It's not the world I know
You promised me
But sometimes we hide
Who we really are
You say you're not sorry for all that you did,
For going too far

While we are trying harder,
Falling deeper
But we are only what we are

Nothing can help us from falling
Hoping we'd come to the fore
I'm not afraid, and I won't be
Your slave anymore
No one can stop us from trying
Hoping we'd settle the score
We're at the end of our rope
At the end of our rope

What's left to know on the other side?
Maybe it's time I rest my troubled mind
Well sometimes we fight
What will never die
Seems like we know that we're trying
Too hard, it's sucking us dry

8. Never Ending
Follow the light, do as they say
It's never ending
Unlock the beast you keep inside you

Swallow your breath, wait for the call
You'll walk the thin line
Welcome to our destiny

Do like the others
You won't be afraid
Fall to the ground and pray again

Never ending
They're all waiting for the call
One step away from it all
Never ending
Always trying, never finding
Shelter from the storm

Wake up the world, all playing god
Won't feel so hollow
The silent voice is there to guide you

Slipping away? Reach out your hand
They'll give you shelter
Welcome to eternity

9. One By One
Ease the pain, no more dying
It's the answer that takes you higher
Just find your voice, that inner fire

Break the rules, and, point that finger
They're all trying to pull you down
Just walk up straight and let them know
You lost your faith

Never turn and walk away
Just spit back in their face
Forget those games they play

We're hungry
Until we come undone
We'll travel down
Those empty highways
There's no way
Before it all begun
We're falling one by one
One by one

No more fear, no more hunger
Let them know that it's all in vain
Now who are they to tell you
What to think and say?

10. Deliverance
It's like you said,
The world is growing colder
It's in our eyes, we know
That it's dying
No return, the weight is on
Our shoulders
So who do we turn to?
Where do we go now?

Their empty hearts,
Two faced and brazen
They turned their backs and tried to,
See it through
We know they'd all agree,
Tomorrow's a memory
And it's all because of you

We are calling for deliverance
Because we know it's over soon
We are calling for deliverance
And we know, yes we know that we all
Wait for the call

It's like they knew,
The world was going under
Here we are, left, torn asunder
Now that all is lost,
No one would disagree
That it's all because of you

11. Fade Away
[Japanese bonus track]

Tell me who would not be weary
When hours turn to days
And all we are, just rats within a maze
So who justified the hero?
That broke out from this cage
Spoke to the madness, then left and burned the stage

Nothing can save us
We're fading away
No one can help us

Fade Away; we'll never be the same
Playing this foolish game
We're destined to fade away
There's nothing to reclaim
Playing this headless game
That's why we all fade away

When the hourglass is broken
And all is plain to see
That is when we're asking to be free

But It's all a grand illusion
It's already too late
Nothing can stop it, no, not even fate

12. Under The Ice
[Japanese bonus track]

The sinners are waiting in line at the doorway to hell
As they're rubbing their bellies and pushing the crap that they sell
Now send us your money and we'll give you blessings by mail
We're building empires and no one will stand in our way

And they know, you're walking the endless mile
Your colours are fading, the hangman they smile

Cause you're under the ice
And now you are fated to pay the price
While heaven is waiting
The sinners are laughing alone
You are under the ice
Just like the others have been before
While heaven is waiting
You're all going under the ice, again

Follow the masses, obey like you're puppets on strings
In the eyes of the world you are sacred, it's making us kings

1. Call Out To The World
I’ve rushed a million miles, haven’t moved at all
Just like the rats, I will keep on going
I’ve severed all my ties, set up for my fall
And just like that, I’m back at square one

Take me, somewhere
Wake me from this nightmare
Hear me, call out to the world

Someone, somewhere
Save me if I fall, you’ll be my savior
Lead the way; I call out to the world

All these countless bugs, crawling in my skin
I’m losing hope, and I’m, going nowhere
I’ve heard a million lies; my patience’s wearing thin
Up to my throat, and I’ve, heard it all before

2. Never Again
Father, father, help me
I have sinned again
I just killed my last friend, can I go, can I go?
Father please relieve me
From this cross I bear
Couldn’t help myself, can’t we let it be?

No, never again
Never the same, my friend
I owe my lesson learned
Never again
I’ll never crash and burn again, again, again

Father, father hear me
I am on my knees
And our dirty secrets, I won’t tell, I won’t tell
I got the shortest straw here
You’re really nowhere near
To each his own, I’m better off alone

You’ll never, you’ll never learn
Just burn your bridges
I’ll never, I’ll never fall again

3. Not The Only
Lying awake, alone in my bed
Voices are calling from inside my head
You’d be surprised, if you knew what they really said

From my dark rooms, I’ve shut the world out
I hide from the word can’t you see,
(it’s) too painful to talk about
I’m not what I used to be

Some things we leave alone
And wish that we’d never known
And sometimes we go too far
To hide our scars

I am not the only,
The only one who runs
No, I am not the only one
And when it’s down
To wire we all run
I’m not the only one

Break down the door;
Let in the light
I’m not the same anymore,
I have to come clean you know
These loose ends just got to go

4. Tell Me
On this dead end road
You just sold yours souls
Buying in on what they told

High and mighty you
And your washed-out smiles
Tell me now, who’s fooling who?

Won’t be afraid no more
Here you found what you’re looking for
Settle for less, round up the clowns,
Obliterate this mess

Say your prayers, little one
And tell me, yeah tell me
After all is said and done
Tell me now, tell me now

I see right through you
How you cry on cue
That’s just all you’ve left to do

5. Not Like You
It’s time to go,
We know there’s something calling
There’s nothing left out here at all, no…
We’re going crazy, it’s no illusion
We’ve had enough, so here we are

Who walks a thin line?
And who’s running on the edge?
This time we know it’s real
We’re falling face down, right into the ground

We are not like you, we are not the same
Not like the fools who follow and live their lives tomorrow
No, we are not like you, we are not the same
And so the story ends, we will never be like you

We’ve had enough, there must be something better
We turn our backs and walk away
We’re getting tired, of all you liars
We’ve heard it all too many times

6. Leave Me Alone
Name the sin, count me in
Remind me that we’re dreaming
Bleed me dry, then hang me high
And call me the fool that I’ve been

Hate this state that I’m in

Cause we’re back
We’re back to the same old story
We’re back
So leave me alone, leave me alone again

Pour me out, run me down
And bore me till I’m done for
Wash me up, say no more
Leave me what’s left on the floor

7. Till I Come Alive
Woke up today, no hope for tomorrow
What I thought would wash away
Needless to say, I’d kind of lost my way
So I’m right here, waiting

No more, no more
Won’t stop trying till I know I’m alive
No way, no way
No denying till I come alive

I turned on a dime,
And counted my blessings
So no more wasting time
Wiped out the slate,
And finally turned the page
And I’m right here, waiting

No, thought I still believe in nothing
Never crawling, never falling
I’ll never be like you

8. Strong Enough
One bad seed in this filty gravel
One bad turn on this crocked road
Took me here, to this path I travel
Made me pay for what I owed

One black cloud on my silver lining
One bad turn that I can’t through
Someone else when I look in the mirror
Someone new in the tainted glass

No, I can’t stand it

Here I go, all alone
It’s time I made it on my own
They tried to make me, tried to brake me
But I’m strong enough

Tried to mold, shape and make me
On my back, like a bad tattoo
Here I am, still torn and ragged
Half a man, that’ll have to do

9. Me
One, just one more drink
One last cigarette and I am on my way
Oh last night, it’s all a haze
Here I pave my way through filth and broken glass

Something is not the same
Something is different from before
Guess that I, guess I died inside

When there’s nothing more
When I’d tried it all
Come undone, when the odds were close to none
When the moment’s there
The divide I beware
Then it’s me, only me

Torn, still torn and bruised
But I’ve had my run, and I’ll, I’ll see it through
All for you, my sweet farewell
Oh, I can’t believe that I survived this hell

10. Pain & Pleasure
Hear you call for me
It’s too late, can’t you see?
Couldn’t help, they spit on you, and called you fool
I believe it just slipped my mind
That I left you behind
I can’t help, you died that day that I betrayed

On and on…

Pain or pleasure
There is no distinction
You will see, someday
That pain is just one step away
Pain or pleasure
There is no distinction
Wish I could explain
That pleasure is equal to pain

I am over you
I keep telling myself
Couldn’t help,
They made you plead,
Made you bleed
I am sorry for what they did
Wasn’t me, god forbid
It hit me now, I’m just like them,
Or worse somehow

Now you’re gone…

The kingdom lies in shadows, now the sun is burning grey
will we even live to see tomorrow?
The echoes of the battlefield still ringing in our cars
Now our future dark and stained with tears of sorrow

The Knights who went before us calling in the wind.
Sill our hearts with honour, now our journey must begin
Together we are standing tall, together we will be forever
Side by side for all eternity

Wings of forever we soar in the sky
United in battle in glory we die
Wings of forever our journey goes on
And we all raise our to the stars far beyond

We cross the distant mountains, riding on through wind and rain
Beneath us in the valley lie the warriors so brave
A place for them is grand by the wisdom of the kings
And we'll join them when they toll the judgement bell

The Knights who went before us calling in the wind
Sill our hearts with honour, now our journey must begin
Together we are standing tall, together we will be forever
Side by side for all eternity

Wings of forever we soar in the sky
United in battle in glory we die
Wings of forever our journey goes on
And we all raise our to the stars far beyond

[Solo (Totman) / Solo (Bickers)]

The Knights who went before us calling in the wind
Sill our hearts with honour, now our journey must begin
Together we are standing tall, together we will be forever
Side by side for all eternity

Wings of forever we soar in the sky
United in battle in glory we die
Wings of forever our journey goes on
And we all raise our eyes to the stars far beyond
Wings of forever we soar in the sky
United in battle in glory we die
Wings of forever our journey goes on
And our wings all raise to the stars far beyond

3. Far Away
[Words and Music - Williams]

Legend tells a secret, buried deep in time
A may to free our people, to free them from these crimes
Lost beneath fountain, across the distant sea
We'll journey there together in search of liberty

We board the ship together and sail into the night
No land to see before us, we follow stars so bright
Then the land is sighted, our journey almost done
We leave the ship unguarded, the legend drivers us on

Through wind and rain we travel, onwards 'cross the land
Guided by the starlight, towards the eastern sands

Far away in a bygone age
When the stories all were true
Legends told by the men of old
Have brought us here today

The fountain stands before us, our mission is complete
We search beneath the water, a sword lies our feet
The sword will bring us glory, our freedom is assured
We will return to save our land from suffering endured

Through wind and rain we travel, onwards 'cross the land
Guided by the starlight, towards the eastern sands

Far away in a bygone age
When the stories all were true
Legends told by the men of old
Have brought us here today

[Solo (Bickers) / Solo (Williams) / Solo (Totman)]

Through wind and rain we travel, onwards 'cross the land
Guided by the starlight, towards the eastern sands

Far away in a bygone age
When the stories all were true
Legends told by the men of old
Have brought us here today

4. Glory Tonight
[Words and Music - Williams]

An echo on the wind tells a distant warning
Time has come for us to make the journey home
We followed all our lives tales of beasts and valour
And heroes who have walked this road before

If there was another way
If the light can pierce the dark
It seems there's nowhere left to turn
We stand up as one now that our time has come.

Twilight surrounds us the night closes in
Darkness has fallen we stand for our King
An empire in shadows the candle burns low
We'll all find some glory tonight

The chaos in our minds tells a different story
If the light can pierce the dark
Now world will see... see what we are made of
And how we'll conquer all to save the crown

Twilight surrounds us the night closes in
Darkness has fallen we stand for our King
An empire in shadows the candle burns low
We'll all find some glory tonight

[Solo (Bickers) / Solo (Williams) / Solo (Bickers) / Solo (Totman)]

If there was another way
If the light can pierce the dark
It seems there's nowhere left to turn
We stand up as one now that our time has come.

We'll all find some glory....... tonight.

5. Power Quest (Part 1)
[Words and Music - Williams]

[Solo (Martongelli)]

A feeling deep within
A memory of how we used to be
I see it in your eyes
And I know you feel the same way too

The seeds of doubt were sown
When confidence has been betrayed
What am I doing here ?
But do you feel the same way too ?

The signs were there but we decided not to look
A premonition of the last page of the book
When we get down to it there's no-one else to blame
Questions may change but the answer's the same

How will I know what I'm searching for
Living my life uncertain
Who will reveal what's behind the door ?
Or must the quest continue

An opportunity
A chance to make amends for what went wrong
Another twist of fate
Conspires to leave me here alone once more

The signs were there but we decided not to look
A premonition of the last page of the book
When we get down to it there's no-one else blame
Questions may change but the answers' the same

How will I know what I'm searching for
Living my life uncertain
Who will reveal what's behind the door ?
Or must the quest continue

How will I know what I'm searching for
Living my life uncertain
Who will reveal what's behind the door ?
Or must the quest continue

[Solo (Williams) / Solo (Bickers) / Solo (Totman) / Solo (Martongelli)]

My spirit will never be broken
The quest will go on to the end
This time is forever
The promise we held deep inside

Thought rivers and mountains between us
Together as one we will be
I'll never stop searching
To find you my friend once again

How will I know what I'm searching for
Living my life uncertain
Who will reveal what's behind the door ?
Or must the quest continue

How will I know what I'm searching for
Living my life uncertain
Who will reveal what's behind the door ?
Or must the quest continue

6. Beyond The Stars
[Music - Totman / Words - Williams, Totman]

Walking through shadows down the night of memory lane
Think of the past I'm reminded once again
A place where the people had gathered as one
Their spirit provided a haven for all

Darkness may cover the land far away
Visions uncover the past once again
My soul feels the echo of yesterdays dream
And our purpose discovered at last.

Reach for the stars that shine bright in the sky
Reach up to heaven you'll hear angels cry
On the road we must follow the dark lord will come
And for ever the quest must go on

The ancient village is destroyed, the people all are gone
Bodies are buried and marked with a stone
The voice of our father still rides on the wind
Brings hope for the ones that are still yet to come

Darkness may cover the land far away
Visions uncover the past once again
My soul feels the echo of yesterdays dream
And our purpose discovered at last.

Reach for the stars that shine bright in the sky
Reach up to heaven you'll hear angels cry
On the road we must follow the dark lord will come
and for ever the quest must go on.

[Solo (Williams) / Solo (Totman) / Solo (Bickers)]

Black Knights together demons they send
We fight the evil on to the end
On the march for ever after, standing by the King forever
Bound to live for now and evermore

Reach for the stars that shine bright in the sky
Reach up to heaven with glory we die

Reach for the stars that shine bright in the sky
Reach up to heaven you'll hear angels cry
On the road we must follow the dark lord will come
And for ever the quest must go on.
And for ever the quest must go on.

7. Immortal Plains
[Words and Music - Williams]

What about everything that happened long ago
What about plans we made together
What about comrades stood beside us way back when
It seemed times would last forever

With sword in hand we will make a stand
Eternity would not see us divided
In the darkest night though there was no light
We see the way before us clear as day

If we live or we die, it will not be goodbye
If we stumble and fall, there's no end to it all
If we fight with our hearts, none can tear us apart
Through the wind and the rain we'll meet again
On immortal plains.

What about all the things that still are yet to come
What about all the things we dreamed of
Can we be certain now just what lies far beyond
Can we feel safe without the answers.

With sword in hand we would make a stand
Eternity would not see us divided
In the darkest night though there was no light
We see the way before us clear as day

[Ch.] If we live or we die, it will not be goodbye
If we stumble and fall, there's no end to it all
If we fight with our hearts, none can tear us apart
Though the wind and the rain we'll meet again
On immortal plains

[Solo (Totman)]

With sword in hand we would make a stand
Eternity would not see us divided
In the darkest night though there was no light
We see the way before us clear as day

If we live or we die, it will not be goodbye
If we stumble and fall, there's no end to it all
If we fight with our hearts, none can tear us apart
Through the wind and the rain we'll meet again
If we live or we die, it will not be goodbye
If we stumble and fall, there's no end to it all
If we fight with our hearts, none can tear us apart
Through the wind and rain we'll meet again
On immortal plains

[Solo (Martongelli)]

8. Follow Your Heart
[Words and Music - Williams]

I dream of strange illusions and the legacy of old
But can I really trust the visions that I see ?
Take me to the temple, I desire to see the truth
And to discover what the future holds for me

The chance you've got may never come to you again
You need some courage now to make a choice my friend
The sands of time dissolve with every breath you take
each step a little closer to the edge

Follow your heart and your dreams will come true
The path that you take and the journey you choose
The future unfolds as you head on your way
Everything possible, every day

I stand and wait in silence for the one who will arrive
To help me understand exactly what to do
Guiding me with wisdom that I'll need to stay alive
Is what I'll need if I'm to see the journey through

The chance you've got may never come to you again
You need some courage now to make a choice my friend
The sands of time dissolve with every breath you take
each step a little closer to the edge

Follow your heart and your dreams will come true
The path that you take and the journey you choose
The future unfolds as you head on your way
Everything possible, every day

[Solo (Adam) / Solo (Steve W) / Solo (Adam) / Solo (Sam)]

[P.] The chance you've got may never come to you again
You need some courage now to make a choice my friend
The sands of time dissolve with every breath you take
each step a little closer to the edge

[C.] Follow your heart and your dreams will come true
The path that you take and the journey you choose
The future unfolds as you head on your way
Everything possible, every day

Follow your heart and your dreams will come true
The path that you take and the journey you choose
The future unfolds as you head on your way
Everything possible, every day

9. Freedom Of Thought
[Words and Music - Adam Bickers]

[Verse 1.]
I look around and what do I see ?
Imprisoned minds in a sick society
I watch as the cycle goes on
Does no one else see that this is wrong ?
Spoon fed ignorant lies whilst imagination dies
Ready to accept (whatever offered next) without question or insight.

[Verse 2.]
I see, but I can't believe
My eyes grow black at this obscenity
Young lives compressed in the mould
Factory pre-set, dead before they're old.
Regurgitating filth, so typical of their ilk
Xenophobic breed, incredulous creed, deprived of all free will.

So fight - Defend your integrity
Be strong - Don't accept mediocrity
Preserve - The individual within
Believe - You never have to give in.

Freedom of thought is the virtue you need
To secure the future with hope and belief
Explore your ambitions and open your mind
There's no limit to what you can find

[Verse 3.]
It's time to make a stand
The future sits rooted in our hands
Break out of this cycle you are in
Uncharted paths is were true life begins.
No need to be alone, to make it on your own
We'll all be there to face the glare of uncertainty (and the) unknown.

So fight - Freedom of thought is the virtue you need
To secure the future with hope and belief
Explore your ambitions and open your mind
There's no limit to what you can find

Freedom of thought is the virtue you need
To secure the future with hope and belief
Explore your ambitions and open your mind
There's no limit to what you can find

[Solo (Totman) / (Bickers) / (Bikers)]

Here we stand, the chosen ones together
Will the Quest go on forever; will we reach the Promised Land
We will find the gold beneath the rainbo
Oh can you still hear the echo in the caverns of your mind ?

Hear the call, leading us to freedo
Will you join us in the kingdom and forever fight or fal
Can it be, that fate is in our favou
We will be each other's saviour as we're tearing down the walls

So many battlefields, we've seen so many di
Carry me by starlight flying high above the sky

Neverworld, beyond the blue horizo
Neverworld, is where we long to b
Across the mountains and before the setting su
Neverworld,

Shadows fall, united true believer
Where the prophecy did lead us, we have reached the hallowed lan
Heart of steel, it will not rest foreve
We are all in this together as we wait the true command.

2. Temple of Fire
[WORDS - WILLIAMS, WALKER / MUSIC - WILLIAMS]

Seeing is believing so believe in what you see
feel the flame of desire burning deep in the fire
Can this be illusion or deluded fantasy ?
Can you see what is true, for me and for you ?

The people gathered all around us
Their voices raised aloud in honour
The spell forever will be broken
See a vision of the past

Day of Old - so the story goes
Travel far - everybody knows
Pilgrim come see your hearts desire
Before the Temple of Fire

I am not hero just an ordinary man
With the will to survive to be free and alive
Come and stand beside us, see the wonder of it all
In the light of the sun, in the shade of the moon

Can you find the answers in the visions that you see ?
Can you still remember what went wrong ?
Stand before the altar in the temple you have dreamt of for so long.

3. Edge of Time
[WORDS & MUSIC - WILLIAMS]

I told you once, told you a thousand times
It's not easy living this way
We chose a path, said it's the only one
The only path that will lead us away

(Find a way) you're not the only one
(Living a life) on a wing and prayer
(Turn around) face another day
You and I have nothing to lose

Stone cold, waiting for night to fall
Waiting for answers we need
Where will it end ? Heavenly requiem,
Can it be that only true hearts will bleed ?

Send a sign, we're standing on the edge of time
Heart divine, a future that once was mine
I can hardly recognize what's right before my eyes
Time dissolves into well below
Time dissolves into the well below

Light has gone, burning oblivion
Unholy silence invading my mind
What does this mean ? Where do we go from here ?
You and I will have to follow the blind.

4. Sacred Land
[WORDS & MUSIC - WILLIAMS]

Memories of childhood, a place so far away
Growing up together, it was where I thought we'd stay
Then one day soldiers came, told us of the wars
They told us we should join them and defend the holy cause

Adventures that would lead far across the land and sea
Sounded so amazing to an innocent like me
Made it seem so easy like nothing could go wrong
We thought we'd be away some time but never for so long

Joined together wrote our names upon the page
Seven times alliance our loyalty we gave
Sworn to be united not divided for the King
Who will ever know the honour that it brings ?

So farewell to the Sacred Land that we call forever home
Time will tell if we understand that we never walk alone
Side by side to the east we ride with our purpose clear and true
On we go, won't you join us too ?

Had no way of knowing if we ever would return
Would we see our loved ones or see more cities burn ?
Holy land will fall if we don't stand our ground
Jerusalem for evermore in darkness be adorned.

5. When I'm Gone
[WORDS & MUSIC - WILLIAMS]

I search the ruins of the world I call my own
In hopeless desperation now I make the journey home
I find that everything is not the way it was
You cannot fight the future; no you can't turn back the clock

The rain upon the mountains
The eagle in the sky
And the wolf and raven prowling all around
A broken cross will mark the holy ground

And when I'm gone, the world carries on
And you must carry on too
When I'm not around, time won't stand still
Your memories will always be true

You've got hold onto the dreams we once shared
Always be together even when I am not there
I'll be beside you every step of every day
Though you cannot see me, feel my presence on the way

6. For Evermore
[WORDS - WILLIAMS, NOLAN / MUSIC - WILLIAMS]

Time after time still not over
There is no ending in sight
Day after day the same old feelings
Surely all this isn't right

There will be sadness in these eyes forever
Lift my head towards the sky
And I know that this will happen more and more
As I watch the spirits drifting through the door of life

I can see angels in the sky
I can see demons down below
I can see everything that you will ever know
If I should live for evermore
And never see another dawn
You will see everything that I have seen before

Living my life am I really alive ?
No one should stay here long
How can it be will you tell me why ?
Talking the right from the wrong

I only hope the day will come
The day when I can close my eyes forever
A life oblivious to time
It feels like waiting for the end of never

Falling from grace the crosses I bear now
Carry them on to the end
Nowhere to turn not a soul even cares now
Only the memory of friends

You will see everything that I ... have seen ... before.

7. Well Of Souls
[WORDS - WILLIAMS / MUSIC - WILLIAMS, SCOTT]

Million voices call to me,
there's nowhere left to run
Souls cry out in torment,
pain and anguish has begun
Trapped for all eternity
no hope of breaking free
Calling out for vengeance,
now they're calling out to me

Will this be our true salvation ?
Can there be a brighter day ?
Will there be a new horizon ?
Will this be the price we pay ?

Chaos and damnation
For the victims of the well
Mortal life of agony,
immortal life of hell
A spell that can't be broken,
see the writing on the wall
Souls in black are silent;
wait to hear the judgement call

Deep inside the well of souls
where time is lost forever
Can you hear me call your name ?
Deep inside the well of souls a
thousand hearts are gathered
There must be someone to blame

8. Into The Light
[WORDS - WILLIAMS / MUSIC - SCOTT]

There was a time and place we would always go
We will meet there once again
Darkness had descended all around our home
Now we begin the journey there

Walk in the path of our fathers before
Wisdom and guidance will carry us through
Walk with the prophet who always did say
Spirits will lead us the rest of the way

Out of the darkness and into the light
Heaven beside us on this sacred night
Out of nightmare and into the dream
Returning together
The light always shines over me

Living isn't easy when you're far away from home
Seven years since we were there before
Many things have happened since we set eyes on you
Citadel in fallout from the war

City home is free again just like it was before
What will happen when we are gone ?
We hear the echoes of the time when we were young ?
Will we see darkness once again ?

9. Lost Without You
[WORDS & MUSIC - WILLIAMS]

It was a cold December morning
Round about midnight
Hear a distant church bell ring
Doesn't really mean a thing
Suddenly I catch your eye
And much to my surprise
You are looking back at me
I wonder just what you can see

Tonight is when you go away
I hope I'll see you soon someday
Candle flickers in the corner of my mind
It has been so many years
Filled with laughter, filled with tears
I just hope the memories linger on...

Can't you see I feel I'm fading away ?
And I don't know if I can face another day
Hearing voices at the back of my head
If this goes on I'm surely gonna end up dead
This was never how I thought it would be
How was I to know you would have this effect on me ?
Like a stranger in a far-away place
Day to day, hoping that it's not too late

Oh, can't you see, you're all I need

So I walk this road without you
Now that you have gone away
Heading for the future not the past
Spend my time without you
Live my own life everyday
How long is the heartache gonna last... oh

Now you're gone and only memories remain
Remind me of you and help to ease this tragic pain
That I'm feeling like I'm caught in a mire
Nowhere to turn, no one to quench the burning fire

I thought I heard you softly calling my name
Can't be true 'cause things will never be the same
Tried to reach you but there's no one at home
Feeling lonely even though I'm not on my own
Can't believe how quickly time has gone by
Days and weeks and months in the blink of an eye
Wish I knew how the story will end
There is one thing - I hope we can still be friends

10. Find The Way To The Top
[WORDS & MUSIC - Martongelli, Garavello]

I am walking in the street
And I'm shouting at this world of confusion
There is no way for me to turn back

Silence in the air seems to be an illusion
I only want to satisfy my soul

They tell me I am wrong but I don't mind their lies
And only with my pride I'll never die

Now I look for more
I look for more
And I wanna have some more so I will fly

I'm gonna find the way to the top
And fly to reach for the Land of the Sun
Where the fire burns and never, never stops
I'm gonna find the way to the top
You know I'll try 'cause I can't get enough
Want live, won't die, want run away, won't stop

I'm gonna find the way to the top
And fly to reach for the Land of the Sun
Where the fire burns and never, never stops
I'm gonna find the way to the top
You know I'll try 'cause I can't get enough
Want live, won't die, want run away, won't stop.

11. When I'm Gone
[lead vocal Sabine Edelsbacher]

[WORDS & MUSIC - WILLIAMS]

I search the ruins of the world I call my own
In hopeless desperation now I make the journey home
I find that everything is not the way it was
You cannot fight the future; no you can't turn back the clock

The rain upon the mountains
The eagle in the sky
And the wolf and raven prowling all around
A broken cross will mark the holy ground

And when I'm gone, the world carries on
And you must carry on too
When I'm not around, time won't stand still
Your memories will always be true

You've got hold onto the dreams we once shared
Always be together even when I am not there
I'll be beside you every step of every day
Though you cannot see me, feel my presence on the way

1. Cemetery Gates
I never walked a lonely road
When I was young
You were always there to guide me
And if I stand up should fall
Along the way
You would pick up all the pieces.

Always I prayed
Pray that the day would never, ever happen
But deep I knew.

And at the cemetery gates
I said goodbye
'Til we meet again in heaven
And as the curtain stars to fall
On all we had
Can I really live without you?

And now I turn and face the truth
I'm older now
With your spirit watching over me
I hope you're in a better place
I have no doubt
Sacred hearts, sacred memories.

Always I prayed
Pray that the day would never, ever happen
But deep I knew.

And at the cemetery gates
I said goodbye
'Til we meet again in heaven
And as the curtain stars to fall
On all we had
Can I really live without you?

Always I prayed
Pray that the day would never, ever happen
But deep I knew.

And at the cemetery gates
I said goodbye
'Til we meet again in heaven
And as the curtain stars to fall
On all we had
Can I really live without you?

And at the cemetery gates
I said goodbye
'Til we meet again in heaven
And as the curtain stars to fall
On all we had
Can I really live without you?

2. Human Machine
I'm trapped inside this life
The same thing every day
Too afraid to change
Is there another way?
I have no confidence
To try and break the chains
We only get one life
And only half remains.

Time slips away
Software corrupted, infected and afraid.

Human machine
Your life was programmed many years ago
Now it's time to set you free
Decode your dreams
Understand the truth that lies below
Shutdown... Reformat... Believe!

Another chance to change
Another exit gone
I didn't have the faith
How could I be so wrong?
Forever unaware
How quickly time goes by
Maybe it's not too late
I still control my fate

Time slips away
Hardware corrupted, infected and afraid.

Human machine
Your life was programmed many years ago
Now it's time to set you free
Decode your dreams
Understand the truth that lies below
Shutdown... Reformat... Believe!

Time slips away
Mankind corrupted, infected and afraid.

Human machine
Your life was programmed many years ago
Now it's time to set you free
Decode your dreams
Understand the truth that lies below
Shutdown... Reformat... Believe!

(Every day, carry out the same routine
9 to 5, cogs in the human machine
40 years, doing what they tell you to
Now you're old, is this what you waited for?)

(Can't you see, not the way it has to be
Make a choice, beauty of humanity
No regrets, I did what I wanted to
Time to die: you did what they told you to.)

3. Civilised?
Turned on the radio to hear
The tragic story of an boy of 7 years
Should be sleeping in his bed
Should be sleeping, but instead he's lying dead.

In a world where children lose their lives
Face the bullet, face the knife
Is this what we call being civilised?

Face the pain, it's all gone wrong
Who's to blame? It can go on
Can't rewind, what's done is done
When will we learn from the memories?

Face the pain, it's all gone wrong
Who's to blame? It can go on
Can't rewind, what's done is done
When will we learn from the memories?

What happened to our pleasant land?
Ignore the suffering, ignore the outstretched hand
That reaches out to us in vain
We are fortunate we don't end up the same.

In a world with nowhere left to run
Spiral downwards, damage done
Is this what we call being civilised?

Face the pain, it's all gone wrong
Who's to blame? It can go on
Can't rewind, what's done is done
When will we learn from the memories?

Face the pain, it's all gone wrong
Who's to blame? It can go on
Can't rewind, what's done is done

Face the pain, it's all gone wrong
Who's to blame? It can go on
Can't rewind, what's done is done
When will we learn from the memories?

4. Kings Of Eternity
A crash of thunder, lightning starts to glow
Standing in the rainstorm you feel so alone
And in the distance can you hear the sound of something new
The sun is hidden now, no rainbows can arise
All across the land the people look up to the skies
Can you see what's coming, do you understand what's gonna be?

Call our name and we'll be there
Stand beside us in the glory you'll share
We will be your guardians for all time.

Kings of Eternity, come to set you free
Breaking the chains for all humanity
Kings of Eternity, nothing left to fear
We are immortal, Kings of Eternity.

We stand among you, this dark and fateful night
Dispel the darkness in a blazing flash of light
We have all the answers; do you doubt that we can save you now?

We walk among you, we walk on higher ground
All of us together let us gather all around
Look into the future; see the way that things are gonna be

Call our name and we'll be there
Stand beside us in the glory you'll share
We will be your guardians for all time.

Kings of Eternity, come to set you free
Breaking the chains for all humanity
Kings of Eternity, nothing left to fear
We are immortal, Kings of Eternity.

Call our name and we'll be there
Stand beside us in the glory you'll share
We will be your guardians for all time.

Kings of Eternity, come to set you free
Breaking the chains for all humanity
Kings of Eternity, nothing left to fear
We are immortal, we are the Kings.

Kings of Eternity, come to set you free
Breaking the chains for all humanity
Kings of Eternity, nothing left to fear
We are immortal, Kings of Eternity.

5. Master Of Illusion
You paint a picture of what you want us to see
Masking the wreckage of our own reality
Ignoring genocide in corners of the world
You're only interested if there's some oil or gold.

Why don't you just reach out your hand
To people of your land?
You turn a blind eye to their plight
How can this be right?

You are the master, the master of illusion
Why don't you ever speak the truth?
You spell disaster, creating deep confusion
Why can't you see what can't you see what you have done?

Ignore the warning signs that come from mother earth
Evolving climate change, there cannot be rebirth
I read it in the news, I see it on TV
Forgotten faces could so easily be me.

You want to send them all to hell
You're going there as well (There as well)
What makes you act the way you do
I see right through you.

You are the master, the master of illusion
Why don't you ever speak the truth?
You spell disaster, creating deep confusion
Why can't you see what can't you see what you have done?

[Solo Monstruoso]

You are the master, the master of illusion
Why don't you ever speak the truth?
You spell disaster, creating deep confusion
Why can't you see what can't you see what you have done?

6. The Vigil
Gonna be the longest night all the angels take to flight
(No-one left to save you, darkness will enslave you)
There are many twists and turns, many lessons to be learned
(Do you yearn for daylight, can you feel the madness?)

Can you find some respite from the chaos in your mind?
Will you see the answers to your prayers?
You will know, some hours from now
If you will live till the day.

Redefine my way in life (Never be lonely)
Sanctify my fractured mind (Broken inside me)
Realign the dark and light (Closer than ever)
Sacrifice my tainted sight (Always behind me now)

I can feel them closing in and the nightmares now begin
(But you have to fight them, only don't believe them)
Tell you black is really white and that day is really night
(They will try to turn you, fingers poised to burn you!)

Can you find some respite from the chaos in your mind?
Will you see the answers to your prayers?
You will know, some hours from now
If you will live till the day.

Redefine my way in life (Never be lonely)
Sanctify my fractured mind (Broken inside me)
Realign the dark and light (Closer than ever)
Sacrifice my tainted sight (Always behind me now)

Can you find some respite from the chaos in your mind?
Will you see the answers to your prayers?
You will know, some hours from now
If you will live till the day.

Redefine my way in life (Never be lonely)
Sanctify my fractured mind (Broken inside me)
Realign the dark and light (Closer than ever)
Sacrifice my tainted sight (Always behind me now)

7. Save The World
This world ain't what it used to be
I'm fighting things I cannot see
I think there's something going on tonight
The future melted with the past
I don't know how long this can last
There's something out there but it don't feel right

Some things I recognise but others seem so strange
Can't believe I fully understand
How things can be one way and
Then suddenly they're turned upon their head.

Sometimes the world can be so blind
Can't see what's right before their eyes
And just deny that they can see things changing
Dance to the beat of a different drum
Imagine where it all went wrong
And try to prove that they just want to save the world.

Our leaders just don't seem to care
They sanction fighting everywhere
But what the hell is all this fighting for?
Then politicians take their leave
Leave the rest of us to grieve
And shed a tear for those who went to war.

Some things I recognise but others seem so strange
Can't believe I fully understand
How things can be one way and
Then suddenly they're turned upon their head.

Sometimes the world can be so blind
Can't see what's right before their eyes
And just deny that they can see things changing
Dance to the beat of a different drum
Imagine where it all went wrong
And try to prove that they just want to save the world.

So can't we all just live our lives?
So many people need not die
Why can't they see we are all flesh and blood?
There has to be another way
I don't care what our leaders say
I know that we can find a brighter day.

Sometimes the world can be so blind
Can't see what's right before their eyes
And just deny that they can see things changing
Dance to the beat of a different drum
Imagine where it all went wrong
And try to prove that they just want to save the world.

Sometimes the world can be so blind
Can't see what's right before their eyes
And just deny that they can see things changing
Dance to the beat of a different drum
Imagine where it all went wrong
And try to prove that they just want to save the world.

8. Hearts & Voices
In a time of restlessness.
We live in hate and fear
Fighting for religion.
As we face another year
Murder breeding murder, a new morality
Killing in the name of some immortal mystery.

For all eternity, we will stand as one
Coming from the corners of the world

Raise your hearts and voices
Raise your hearts and voices
Raise your hearts and voices
Now! (Raise them)

Raise your hearts and voices
Raise your hearts and voices
Raise your hearts and voices
Now! (Raise them now)

Can you see the justice, the reason for this crime?
Ain't no fight for freedom.
Can we really be so blind?
Brother stands with brother, don't need to be afraid
We are all the children and we must not fade away

For all eternity, we will stand as one
Coming from the corners of the world

Raise your hearts and voices
Raise your hearts and voices
Raise your hearts and voices
Now! (Raise them)

Raise your hearts and voices
Raise your hearts and voices
Raise your hearts and voices
Now! (Raise them now)

And we will find a way to stay together now
And send a message cross the stars.

Raise your hearts and voices
Raise your hearts and voices
Raise your hearts and voices
Now! (Raise them)

Raise your hearts and voices
Raise your hearts and voices
Raise your hearts and voices
Now! (Raise them now)

9. I Don't Believe In Friends Forever
You never know who you can trust
You never know who's gonna stab you in the back
Sometimes you just don't know your friends
Sometimes you gotta sleep with one eye open.

It's hard to know who's on your side and who's against
It's hard to recognise the truth behind the lies
Sometimes a moment, sometimes many, many years
You'll find it written in their eyes.

I don't believe in friends forever
I trusted you and you just shot me down
I don't believe in friends for forever
30 pieces of silver - it's over now.

Some people only think of them
Their deeds remind me what I never want to be
They have no reason to exist
All they do in life is count their money

It's hard to know who's on your side and who's against
It's hard to recognise the truth behind the lies
Sometimes a moment, sometimes many, many years
You'll find it written in their eyes.

I don't believe in friends forever
I trusted you and you just shot me down
I don't believe in friends for forever
30 pieces of silver - it's over now.

[Solo]

It's hard to know who's on your side and who's against
It's hard to recognise the truth behind the lies
Sometimes a moment, sometimes many, many years
You'll find it written in their eyes.

I don't believe in friends forever
I trusted you and you just shot me down
I don't believe in friends for forever
30 pieces of silver - it's over now.

10. Never Again
I always had a dream, pictures in the magazines
Want to be like all my hero's are
Will I die before I'm old; live the life of rock n' roll
Travel all the highways of the world.

I took the easy way
Turned my back and walked away
Didn't have the courage or the will
Sometimes it's hard to say
Question what I did that day
Now I know I'll hide away no more.

Never again will I hide myself in shadows
Never again will I look the other way
Never again will I take the easy option
Never again, I won't wait another day.

And now I'm standing here, metal anthems fill the air
Playing through the songs you all wanted to hear
Without you we will fall, you're the ones who heed the call
You're the ones who make the dream come true.

I took the easy way
Turned my back and walked away
Didn't have the courage or the will
Sometimes it's hard to say
Question what I did that day
Now I know I'll hide away no more.

Never again will I hide myself in shadows
Never again will I look the other way
Never again will I take the easy option
Never again, I won't wait another day.

Sometimes it seems another chance won't come my way
Won't stop believing that it might just be my day

[Solo]

Never again will I hide myself in shadows
Never again will I look the other way
Never again will I take the easy option
Never again, I won't wait another day.

11. Reckoning Day
[Megadeth Cover]

I like the way that I make you itch
And all the reasons I give you to bitch
And how I make you wanna scream in pain
And feel your life is just a losing game

I like the way that you let me in
The way you look when the walls cave in
I like the way that your stomach knots
And how you cry for it all to stop

I like the way that you fool yourself
And make believe there's nobody else
I like the way that you stand in line
And beg salvation from the empty skies (empty skies)

Don't want no revenge
Ain't no pay back time
It ain't called getting even
Here comes the reckoning day

I like the things that you try to fake
And your face when I see you break
And that you say you will pray for me
You realize you are prey for me

I like the way you stay on attack
No matter what, I keep coming back
And how you try to hold me down
But you end up driven to the ground (to the ground)

Don't want no revenge
Ain't no pay back time
It ain't called getting even
Here comes the reckoning day

[solo]

Don't want no revenge
Ain't no pay back time
It ain't called getting even
Here comes the reckoning day
Here comes the reckoning day


1. Find My Heaven
When the thunder rolls, lightening in the sky
Do you carry on regardless even though you all may die?
And when the sun burns down, draining you of life
Do you crumble in the desert; do you fight to stay alive?

So we ride over the mountains
Over the mountains that stand in our way
We will fly, higher and higher
Searching for destiny.

Where will I find my heaven?
Can it really be here on earth?
How can I know what's waiting?
How will I know what's meant for me?

When the devil calls, devil calls your name
Do you run like little children, running from the game?
And when the evil lies buried near your heart
Do you turn against your people, tearing them apart?

See the shadowland, hidden from the light
Feel the terror rising on this cold deserted night
Broken promises, not to be fulfilled
Never trust a demon, never fall under his will.

2. Galaxies Unknown
We all travel light and space
To find the answer to the question
Save the human race.
Far out to galaxies unknown
We'll never give searching
Always thinking of our home.

The sands of our existence running low
There's only one direction for us all to go.

Into the sky, high above where the eagle flies
We journey to find a new home
Beyond the stars where a new life will wait for us
Somewhere we all can belong.
Our world is dying as we speak
From policy and government
The future's looking bleak.
We all must stand up for what's right
The poor are getting poorer
And the planet won't survive.

Tired of the fighting destroying our world
Now is the time to be strong
No turning back, we are leaving today
Hoping to find our own way.
We cried an ocean full of tears
For those we left behind us
When we made the journey here
I hope that somehow they survive
The odds are stacked against them
In their Quest to stay alive.

3. Hold On To Love
This all happened many years ago
When you and I first met
We were strangers from different towns
The scene for us was set
Pretty soon we were hanging out
Spending time as friends
Didn't know what it's all about
The signals that you sent.

Closer now, don't think I will ever leave you
Never, ever say goodbye.

Hold on to Love, don't let it slip away
Hold on to Love, we'll take it day by day
When hearts are broken you will find
All that you had has been left behind
Whoo-ah! hold on to Love

You were there when my best friend died
To ease me through the pain
But you never seemed to realize
Was you that kept me sane
Looking back on everything that was
So many years ago
Do you ever think of all those times
When it was me and you?

4. Diamond Sky
I'm searching for glory and truth
You know it's not gonna be easy
Maybe I'm dreaming, but life is so cruel
The power is leading my heart.

Draw in your mind a utopian world
I want to break free and escape here
Don't wanna hide in the shadows no more
Follow me, it's not too late.

Now try to believe me
From now on you've all got to listen to me
We never will fall
Forever we'll be free

Fly over the sun, find a way out
Higher and higher
We'll ride together as one
Back to the Diamond Sky.

Show me the way that you try to survive
What is your only desire?
See the destruction around us tonight
Spread all our faith through the fire.

Fly over the sun, find a way out
Higher and higher
We'll ride together as one
Back to the Diamond Sky.
Fly over the sun, follow the light
Holding your life
We'll ride together as one
Straight to the Diamond Sky

We'll climb all the hills and the mountains
Right now through the clouds we will find
The saviour that keeps all our lives
Leading us to the sky.

We are the ones that will save human kind
Fight for a place we can stay in
Send me a sign if you still wanna try
Look for the truth once again

5. The Message
I saw you turn and walk away
I never thought that day would be the last day
We would ever meet.
Looking back on all we had
We had each other and that was enough for us
Didn't need any more.

Now it's time to leave again
Time to travel many miles
I will think of you tonight.

And I wake up all alone
A message on my phone
Saying you've left me - for another guy
And you say I'm never home
I'm always on the road
But I still love you more that you'll ever know.

I guess we never really knew
How things would change for the and for you
Couldn't see it at all
Said you wanted me to stay
I heard your words but there was no way
I could give up my dream.

6. Soulfire
The light around me turns to grey
I'm falling
Memories of yesterday
Recalling

Something's changed but I don't know why
And I don't know where I should turn
Re-arranged all the sands of time
Blood in my veins stars to burn.

Soulfire, burning forever
Soulfire, a flame in the night
Guiding the way like a lamp in the darkness
Soulfire always burns in sacred light.

See the remnants of forgotten dreams
Evolving
Places I was sure that I had been
Dissolving

7. Children Of The Dream
When I was young, spent my time just dreaming
Moving on to find a better life.
Seen enough of sorrow to last me all my days
Heard enough of how it doesn't have to be that way.

All I ever wanted was to keep the dream alive
All I ever needed was someone to be my guide.
How was I to know where the road of life would go
Could I make the journey on my own?

We're all Children of the Dream
That lives in us unseen
Forever young.
We're all Children of the Dream
Wherever we may be
Forever dream.

As I grew up, start to see how life goes
Reality that childhood has to end.
Funny how those teenage years seem long but pass on by
Funny how the memories resemble someone else's life.

All is lost, innocence is gone forever
Hope the dream will never end.

8. Strike Force
When you feel in danger
Everyone's a stranger now
What more can you do?
When you feel uncertain
Behind a twitching curtain, yeah
Where else can you go?

All alone, there's no one left for you
Fear unknown, they're coming for you too.
Close to tears, the ending of the years
Who is gonna come and save you now?

Send for the Strike Force to come and deliver you now
Call on the Strike Force we'll come and put right what went wrong
It won't take us long !

If you feel like lying
Gonna end up dying soon
They will hunt you down
Don't you know the answer?
Will you take a chance right now?
There's nothing left to lose.

9. Another World
Another time, another space
I don't know if you'll hear me calling to you
Through the night, this endless night
I don't know if I'll ever find my way home.

I see around me only emptiness
I don't know where my world has gone
It feels like I just don't belong.

Now we live in different worlds
Far across the universe
No return, I'll journey no more
Try to put right what went wrong.

Blazing spires and rapid fire
I see ruins of a temple before me
Inside out and outside in
Can this be what is left of the world that I was in?

Searching high, searching low
Finding the way that will take me back to you
Choice is made I cannot leave
Sacrifice myself to this world of sin.

10. Magic Never Dies
It started long ago, when stories still were told
And heroes still defended their world
The centuries went by and all the stories died
And no one knew that magic survived.

The last of the mage line
Conjured a spell that would live forever
A chant and a rift in time
He journeyed into the unknown.

Whatever the future may bring
The magic will remain in all of us
Whatever the danger we face
Together we will all be strong enough
To find our salvation in life
To follow the ways of old
You can be sure in the one thing we know
Magic never dies.

The kingdom of the night, against the mages might
Has battled since the dawning of time
With darkness all around, a ray of hope is found
To save us from destroying our world

The world will be at peace, the west and in the east
When people learn the ways of the light
And stories will be told, just as in days of old
And magic lives in all our souls

11. The Longest Night
We've come so far again
No chance to turn away
We've come too far to falter now or be afraid.

Way beyond endurance is the place that we are thrown
Hungry and weak
We are tired and alone.

We must go on - don't listen to the devil's song
We must go on - to build the Promised Land again.

The longest night - shattered by the morning light
Breaking through the darkness with the power of hope inside me
The farthest land - conquered by the heart of man
Tearing through the darkness with the power of hope to guide me.

Desolate and barren is the place that we now dwell
Torn apart and dying now
The final living hell.

He may wait for us to fall
But we won't bow in fear to his demands and calls.

We may run to distant shores
But we will not kow-low to his desires or petty laws

2. Rising Anew
I've seen the writing on the wall, believe me
I know they wanted us to fall away
They criticised our every move, deceivers
They never wanted us to break their chains

[Chorus I:]
They sit in judgement and they think they know it all
They act like gods but they are human after all
I don't care what they say
They just want to shoot us down in flames

[Chorus II:]
Rising anew, in from the cold
Ready to strike, never grow old
No one can ever hold us down
Rising again, back on the streets
We have the power to believe
No one on earth can stop us now

The words they write are not the truth, I've seen them
Refuse to open up their eyes and ears
For you my friends we carry on, believers
The Quest will always be what makes us strong

[Chorus I]
[Chorus II]

[Solo / Interlude]

[Chorus II]

3. Glorious
We are the chosen ones, marching out to distant lands
I don't know when we will return
So many miles from home, lonely road we travel on
We have a mission to fulfill

[Chorus I:]
Over rainbows and stars
You can be sure I'll be there
When you're feeling alone
These are the words that will lift up your heart

[Chorus II:]
Glorious
Sunrise in Eden, the will to go on
Glorious
Never surrender, our lives will be glorious

Forever we are free, standing here in unity
No one can ever bring us down
Beyond the fires of hell, deep inside a wishing well
You'll find the answers that you seek

[Chorus I]
[Chorus II]

[Solo / Interlude]

[Chorus I]
[Chorus II]
[Chorus II]

4. Sacrifice
I saw it in your eyes
You left me paralysed
Now I can't remember how I felt before
Was it all in vain?
Another losing game
I can feel the fire that rages in my heart

This ain't the time to be afraid
You're not the only one who feels this way

[Chorus:]
Sacrifice - sacrifice my life
To be with you tonight
Sacrifice - nowhere left to hide
I need you by my side
Sacrifice - all the wrongs seem right
Don't leave me here alone
Sacrifice - steal away my soul
I want you to know

[Solo / Interlude]

It's only you and me
The way it's meant to be
It was written long ago before we walked the earth
I will depend on you
For you to pull me through
Climb the highest mountain to be right by your side

[Chorus]

[Solo / Interlude]

This ain't the time to be afraid
You're not the only one who feels this way

[Chorus]

5. Survive
World of confusion
Face oblivion
Veil of illusion
Everything is wrong

Leaders they fail us
Just don't have a prayer
Serving self interest
No one really cares

[Chorus I:]

After all is said and done
There's nothing left to lose
Has the story finally ended tonight?
Have you made your final move?
The sands are running low
Can you see a new horizon tonight?

[Chorus II:]

We can run, we can hide
We can say our last goodbye
Heaven knows, we're all too young to die
We can fight, we can try
Living under the same sky
Be aware, don't be scared
We'll survive

Power of deception
Growing every day
Communication
Nothing left to say

Heart of a lion
To fight their evil ways
We're only human
We must not be afraid

[Chorus I]
[Chorus II]

[Solo / Interlude]

Looking back on better days
Can't believe that we have fallen so far
Who can help us find our way?
Who can take away their power and set us all free?

[Solo / Interlude]

[Chorus II]
[Chorus II]

6. Better Days
Talk about a better day
Don't know what you heard
In the end your actions speak louder than words
Do you want the easy way
You're so unprepared
Let me know when you have decided to care

[Chorus I:]
I'm never giving in
I'm reaching for the stars
I'll never falter now
I've come so far

[Chorus II:]
Living the life that I've got to live
All I've ever dreamed of
Giving it all that I've got to give

Thought about another way
Could I break the rules
Time to be the master, not one of the fools
Only getting older
Will not be afraid
In the end there's nothing that can't be changed

[Chorus I]
[Chorus II]
[Chorus II]

[Solo / Interlude]

[Chorus I]
[Chorus II]
[Chorus II]

7. Crunching The Numbers
We fell on harder times than we had known before
Heading for tomorrow full of fear
Unemployment riding high, the country on its knees
Heading for disaster so it seems

[Chorus I:]
We worked so hard but for no return
Money just slipping through our hands
What can we do now but carry on
Fingers to the bone

[Chorus II:]
Don't believe the things you read or see upon the TV screen
From your own conclusions, practice what you preach
Time has come to realise, economy is jeopardised
Where does that leave us now?

[Chorus III:]
Crunching the numbers is all we can do
Hope there's enough left for me and you
Cross the line, the great divide
Crunching the numbers from black into red
Hope to survive, not to end up dead
Can this be what is left for me?

We put our trust in those who said they wouldn't fail
Find the right investment for us all
Stocks and shares and banking institutions up for sale
Everything we worked for ends in tears

[Chorus I]
[Chorus II]
[Chorus III]

[Solo / Interlude]

[Chorus III]

8. Only In My Dreams
She's an angel, running all night through the badlands
Trying to find her way home
Hiding her eyes from the sandman
Till morning breaks through she's alone
Searching the dark like a radar
Trying so hard to believe
Avoiding the glare of the hangman
She reaches for someone to hold

[Chorus I:]
If she only knew, I'll be right there with her forever
How can I explain the feelings that I know are true?

She's in danger, hearing her voice in the silence
Trying to find a way through
Feeling the eyes of a stranger
Burning so deep in her soul
Look at her now she's surrounded
Searching so hard for the light
Memories of heartbreak, confusion
I won't let her out of my sight

[Chorus I]

[Chorus II:]
Hold me now and stay forever
Till the sky comes crashing down
Save me now, I can't remember
If you're only in my dreams

[Solo / Interlude]

[Chorus I]
[Chorus II]
[Chorus II]

9. Blood Alliance
Locked in our hearts are secrets
Never to be told
Deep in our minds are wishes
Never to unfold
We are the small communion
Hide behind closed doors
Born of a blood alliance
Beyond the realms of law

[Chorus I:]
Promise of truth passed to us all
Father to son, heritage calls
Follow the path, follow the sign
Keepers of faith as long as we stay alive

[Chorus II:]
Forever we will be guardians of the flame
Creating history, we don't reveal our name
We're not so innocent, we call for mercy
We are the ones who will remain unheard of

We are the sworn protectors
Legacy of old
We are the isolated
Condemned to walk alone
Code of the esoteric
Buried deep in time
We hold the only cipher
Ministry of crime

[Chorus I]
[Chorus II]

[Solo / Interlude]

Where are the new messiahs?
Prophets of the age
We are the true disciples
Shadow renegades
We hear the distant echo
Calling down the years
We are the lonely angels
Hidden but always near

[Chorus I]
[Chorus II]

10. City Of Lies
They thought the streets were paved with gold
And riches still untold
They didn't realise the truth
I heard the stories long ago
How young men went alone
Searching for fortune and for fame

A final chance to make amends
The phoenix from the flames
Evolving tales from history
Carry our hope for all these years
And letting go your fears
To leave the mark on Neverworld

[Chorus I:]
And when the daylight fades, it's dangerous outside
Don't walk the streets alone, you just might not survive
Out there in the shadows they are waiting there for you
Waiting for the moment to arrive

[Chorus II:]
Nowhere to hide in the city of lies
No one to turn to, life's on the line
Nothing to save you from what you'll become
Caught in a web, trapped in the city of lies

I see the truth with my own eyes
There's nothing to disguise
A city now consumed by crime
There are no rainbows and no gold
Just nightmares to be sold
To desperate souls on borrowed time

[Chorus I]
[Chorus II]

[Solo / Interlude]

[Chorus I]
[Chorus II]

Nothing to save you from what you'll become
Caught in a web, trapped in the city of lies

11. Time To Burn
[Bonus track]

We are responsible, we cannot shake the blame
We have the scientific knowledge to remain
United Nations, do they really stand as one?
Subversive politics, but surely this is wrong

[Chorus I:]
It's safe to say that it won't happen in our lifetime
But that's no reason to ignore the warning signs

[Chorus II:]
Time - there'll be no long goodbyes
There's no way to survive
This world is lost forever
Burn - there's no air left to breathe
There's no one here to grieve
Life is finally over

It's time to burn

We have the evidence, we cannot turn and leave
We are the generation haunted by disease
Some day when we are gone, our planet on its knees
Maybe they'll question why we flattered to deceive

[Chorus I]
[Chorus II]

It's time to burn

Across the universe, an echo far away
Another planet dies, another born today
After millennia when others take our place
I hope they learn from our mistakes

[Solo / Interlude]

[Chorus I]
[Chorus II]

It's time to burn

2. Emerald Sword
Crossed the valleys the dust of midlands
to search for the third key to open the gates
Now I'm near the altar the secret inside
as legend told my beloved sun light the dragons eyes
On the way to the glory I'll honour my sword
to serve right ideals and justice for all

Finally happened the sun lit their eyes
the spell was creating strange games of light
Thanks to hidden mirrors I found my lost way
over the stones I reached the place it was a secret cave
In a long bloody battle that prophecies told
the light will prevail hence wisdom is gold

For the king for the land for the mountains
For the green valleys where dragons fly
For the glory the power to win the black lord
I will search for the emerald sword

Only a warrior with a clear heart
could have the honour to be kissed by the sun
Yes, I'm that warrior I followed my way
led by the force of cosmic soul I can reach the sword
On the way th the glory I'll honour my sword
to serve right ideals and justice for all

For the king for the land for the mountains
For the green valleys where dragons fly
For the glory the power to win the black lord
I will search for the emerald sword

3. Wisdom Of The Kings
Removed the stones which hide the cave
blind and dark along my way
I must go on wise and brave before a last hail
At the end of floor stairs  of ancient stone
lead me to a vision, an unreal hall

And they appear in front of me
lightened by a mystic flame
A new dimension I have to face beyond the gates
I can not believe oh what now I see
when the two demons awake from the sleep

Holy dragons keepers of time
Ride brave the blue skies and spell my eyes
Fly beyond these hills ride on the wind
The wisdom of the kings

Lost in a dream I'm under the spell
of this sunny magic land
But Aresius said: Become aware! All can hide the hell...
Now it's time to go to the mighty sword
it's time to follow the kings holy call

Holy dragons keepers of time
Ride brave the blue skies and spell my eyes
Fly beyond these hills ride on the wind
The wisdom of the kings

4. Heroes Of The Lost Valley
[Part I: Entering the Waterfalls Realm]

[instrumental]

[Part II: The Dragons Pride]

"Yes, mighty warrior... What you hear now are the suffering, voices of all
the heroes that crossed these lands before you. They ended their quest tragically
but their thirst for victory is still alive and breathers through these
ancient rocks corroded by the fury of the wind. Their pride now rides with you..."

5. Eternal Glory
Echoes of terror in this old land
I see the result of their quest
Skulls of old heroes lie everywhere in this mystical place
Dust in their eyes, dust in my pride
in this infinite journey to the ancient sword

I can hear their lament between these rocks
the whisper on an angry ghost
he speaks for them all trapped on this lost world
I am their very last hope
to ride from hell free once again
to break the chains from a bloody past for my victory

Eternal glory ride fast to me
pound in my heart for the Algalord kings
Eternal glory spread your wide wings
fly and forever lead my holy steel

I'll fight I'll cry for your silence your name
You'll live through me I will end all your pain
for the swan in the lake the bird on the tree
the place for my beloved lands
The black king is near and Algalord calls
so heroes of the lost valley raise all your voice

Eternal glory ride fast to me
pound in my heart for the Algalord kings
Eternal glory spread your wide wings
fly and forever lead my holy steel

6. Beyond The Gates Of Infinity
Fire of wisdom light the sky
let me go no through this dark evil ground
A veil of fog now covers all
something is happening my heart must be strong
Keep away monsters of hell
No, I won't give you my inviting flesh

Deformed creatures all around me
crept out from ancient and unholy crypts
They'll be your madness they'll be your end
they'll lick your bones and they'll drink your brain
Keep away monsters of hell
No, I won't give you my inviting flesh

Your tongue will be torn your bowels my food
your body impaled of shit will be full
now foolish warrior hear my words

You are condemned and you will come
with us all beyond the gates of infinity

I'm the mighty warrior herd of the northern lands
Algalord is calling so your hell must wait

Your tongue will be torn your bowels my food
your body impaled of shit will be full
now foolish warrior hear my words

You are condemned and you will come
with us all beyond the gates of infinity

7. Wings Of Destiny
Day has gone but I'm still here with you
my sweet rose my green hills
beloved sea, lakes and sky
beloved mother earth

Silent land erase my thoughts
I wanna lose myself in you, all in you
caress me and my soul
while I close my eyes

On wings of destiny
through virgin skies
to far horisons I will fly

Dear peaceful land, dear mother earth
caress my soul while I close my eyes

On wings of destiny
through virgin skies
to far horisons I will fly

8. The Dark Tower Of Abyss
Spread your wings to dark horisons
fly where the twilight reigns
Mighty Tharos cross the line of hell
it's so near

Lost in the shadow I search for my sun
Fly and face it before the new moon
there where chaos rules

Domine deterges nubila caeld
Bellator a proposito non deterreres
Unholy vision ancestral terror
spare my mind my innocent eyes

"...And suddenly the the unreal silence is broken by a lament...
A lament coming up from the deepest Darkest abyss...
And from the seven gates of the dark fortress
the dead come back to life to face him... this is hell..."
Immortal fire now light my heart light my way
Face the old legend the guardian of space and time

Living dead on black winged demons
fly high to play with your head
Gothic portals mystic towers
between the dark clouds

Lost in the shadow I search for my sun
Fly and face it before the new moon
there where chaos rules

9. Riding The Winds Of Eternity
Wise and mighty you are force of the earth
Fierce becomes the sea at your command
Winds of the south winds of the north
let me hear your call
Blow on my heart filling my soul
give me the force of the storm

For all of the  time I will ride be my guide
I will follow your sign for a just life
Winds of the  south winds of the north
let me hear your call
Blow on my heart filling my soul
give me the force of the storm

Riding the holy winds, winds of eternity
I'll fight you forever nightmares sons

10. Symphony Of Enchanted Lands
[Part I: Tharos Last Flight]

"Oh, cruel, destiny... The tears soon covered the warrior's face and Tharos,
the beloved dragon, spread his wings for the last time, happy to have found
the freedom at least in death... Fly... fly high, mighty Tharos... Your name
will always be remembered by the people of the enchanted lands... and your
memory will march with us forever against the hordes of the black lord for
the salvation of the enchanted lands.
Goodbye, brother... goodbye...!!"

[Part II: The Hymn of the Warrior]

God of dawn, father of thunder
Lord of the wind now blowing on me
Thank you for all, for your holy sign
For mountains and hills, the forest, the sea
for all those dead and for my princess
they'll shed their blood cause finally
the emerald sword is now mine

[Part III: Rex Tremende]

For what you did to them
you will burn in my hate

Son of hell betrayer of light
king of the dark your name is carved on my steel
for your will the innocent die every day
but my sword will soon come for you all
and your kingdom will fall
and you'll be dust again forever

Rex tremende semper inimice
ad gloriam perpetuam brave all we'll march
to give you the eternal agony

Love magic word fill all my dreams eternally use me
Love guide me to ecstasy to victory to infinity
to rhymes of winds to the voice of the dead
to innocence of my memory

Rape of earth I want your head
sadist pig I can't forgive what you did
all the blood you're sucking out of my land
But my sword will soon come for you all
and your kingdom will fall
and you'll be dust again forever

Rex tremende semper inimice
ad gloriam perpetuam brave all we'll march
to give you the eternal agony

[Part IV: The Immortal Fire]

"Go, mighty warrior... The kings of enchanted lands are awaiting your
victory! Ride on the wings of wisdom, ride beyond the middle valleys to
defeat the master of chaos in the name of cosmic justice. Peace and love
forever!"

"At the court of king Chaos only blood
can write its own tragedy..."

Mighty warriors from the silver hills
march, all led by golden winds
Elves and trolls from holy mystic woods
run through the last snow

He's now coming from the middle lands
handling proud his magic sword
Glory, pride and honor ride with him
Burns the flame of north

They will all meet in the Kazar ruins
not so far from Ancelot
In the temple of the fallen one
their hope will be born...

Born from the ashes of ancient glory... Born!

They all hail the mighty chosen one
reaching the skies with their cry
They are ready to reach Ancelot
Arwald's calling loud...

"Glory ride with us!  Lux Triumphans!
Magic and steelgods lead us to a new dawn..."

2. Dawn Of Victory
[Turilli / Staropoli]

Fire is raging on the battlefield
while Arwald is fighting the war of the kings
The army of Dargor, the thunder, the storm...
so people are calling the brave and his sword
No time left to save the wise throne!

Shades of a past not so far to forget...
the rise of the demons from their bloody hell!
So come mighty warrior to light the lost hope
for Tharos the dragon and your cosmic soul...
Now handle your emerald sword!

For Ancelot
the ancient cross of war
for the holy town of gods
Gloria, gloria perpetua
in this dawn of victory

The ride of the dead and their practice of pain
is pounding in him as a terrific quake
You're closer and closer now follow their smell
with your holy armour the steel in your hand
Fly angel of bloody revenge!

For Ancelot
the ancient cross of war
for the holy town of gods
Gloria, gloria perpetua
in this dawn of victory

Tragic and furious the clash of the steel of the gods
and so magic the power, the sword in his valorous hands
Oceans of fire are blasting the throne of the demons
and from distant red skies the thunders are calling his name
the name of the master of pain!

For Ancelot
the ancient cross of war
for the holy town of gods
Gloria, gloria perpetua
in this dawn of victory

3. Triumph For My Magic Steel
[Turilli / Staropoli]

Flies to where old dragons are lying
the cry for the triumph for my magic sword
Burns the pride of my mighty conscience
while rises the sceptre of our wise lord
So thunder and storm, the rage of the sword
the fury of my war
The axe of the dwarf, the blood on the stone
the scream for the eternal

Rage in the wind at the triumph for my magic steel
you will taste the blade of the ancient sword... and
Rage in the wind at the triumph for my magic steel
led by hundreds of mighty and fallen lords

Dead, laments and unholy sorrow
The heads of the fallen are staining the snow
May this be the last hated cruel war
I'm looking at my skies but they answer not!
So thunder and storm, the rage of the sword
the fury of my war
The axe of the dwarf, the blood on the stone
the scream for the eternal

Rage in the wind at the triumph for my magic steel
you will taste the blade of the ancient sword... and
Rage in the wind at the triumph for my magic steel
led by hundreds of mighty and proudly fallen brave lords

Old cathedrals dusty graves where nest the seeds of holy victory
Blood from old crypts gushing out to drown the deadly cosmic enemy
Steel all around for the king and his crown
Winds of the dawn are caressing us all...
Ancelot smiles at the knights' epic cry
Thanks to the old and their emerald sword
The kingdom is now hailing the triumph over Dargor
and he the man from Loregard he stands in front of all... of all!

4. The Village Of Dwarves
[Turilli / Staropoli]

The dwarves of Lork are showing all their honour
when you walk on the Gandor secret hill

The dance for fire and wind
and the stories about old kings
are pleasing our brave lords
down in the village of dwarves

The elves are playing under timeless willows
while blue and red paint all my beloved land

The dance for fire and wind
and the stories about old kings
are pleasing our brave lords
down in the village of dwarves

The eagle's eye is hiding something tragic
but in this night the red wine rules in me

The dance for fire and wind
and the stories about old kings
are pleasing our brave lords
down in the village of dwarves

And all night long me Arwald and Aresius
we speak, we laugh, we honor our king

The dance for fire and wind
and the stories about old kings
are pleasing our brave lords
down in the village of dwarves

And time has come now to ride
before the end of the night
the march of the swordmaster
to the unholy fight

5. Dargor, Shadowlord Of The Black Mountain
[Turilli / Staropoli]

Mighty and brave is the fighter of shade
He's prince of the darklands... Dargor his name
Adopted by Vankar, old wizard of Helm
disciple of evil he twisted his brain

Fire burns between pride and honour
Steel wild pounds in his dragonheart
Face to face with the cult of evil
Prince of lands of the darkest dream

We sing to the wind the legend of the kings
to spread our heart to the kingdom of dust
where heroes are lost, where's reigning the shadowlord

Power and glory but for the wrong side
For his tragic past he disowned the sunlight
But Akron knows well all the truth of that day
He needs him as fighter, a warrior so brave

Fire burns between pride and honour
Steel wild pounds in his dragonheart
Face to face with the cult of evil
Prince of lands of the darkest dream

We sing to the wind the legend of the kings
to spread our heart to the kingdom of dust
where heroes are lost, where's reigning the shadowlord

6. The Bloody Rage Of The Titans
[Turilli / Staropoli]

Between my trees the unicorn runs
from the highest mountains the water falls
Flowers and plants now caress my eyes
along these holy valleys kissed by light
And I am victim of this spell
wonderful symphony of enchanted lands...

The whisper of spring is now carried by winds
the winds from the land of the fire
Where peace is a gift from the king of the kings
It seems so strongly unreal... unreal!

Dragons and demons beware!
It's the rage of the titans...
Is the titans' bloody rage!
Warlords and steelgods beware!
It's the rage of the titans...
Is the titans' bloody rage!

The oak, my sister, smiles at the sun
now free from the weight of winter
The eagles fly from mountain to mountain
enchanting my heart... brave heart!

Dragons and demons beware!
It's the rage of the titans...
Is the titans' bloody rage!
Warlords and steelgods beware!
It's the rage of the titans...
Is the titans' bloody rage!

7. Holy Thunderforce
[Turilli / Staropoli]

Face me evil bastard, smell the hate of angels
Glory, pride and bloodshed
Cowards and beholders, rapers of my wisdom
mix of dust and bones
Go back to your abyss, Algalord will not fall
but your heads will soon roll
Test the blade of heroes, fury of the thunder
hit my golden shield

So we'll fight against the wind for the glory of the kings
to defeat the evil enemies
And we'll ride with our lord for the power and the throne
in the name of holy thunderforce

Arwald and Aresius with the nordic warrior
on their way to Hargor
Chaos and oblivion, turmoil and disorder
will have now their name
The last fallen heroes will defeat your forces
Thousand spirits calling
On the furthest mountain I will see your fire
quenched by holy frost!

So we'll fight against the wind for the glory of the kings
to defeat the evil enemies
And we'll ride with our lord for the power and the throne
in the name of holy thunderforce

8. Trolls In The Dark
[instrumental]
[Turilli]

9. The Last Winged Unicorn
[Turilli / Staropoli]

The seven red flames of the cave
are lightning the horrible torture
constricted to see he regrets
to have had the life from his god
Airin sheds black tears supporting the terrible rape
the fury of the sons of the thunder
is breaking the mystical chain

Arwald falls so to his knees
while Akron the black king is laughing
the princess falls down on the stones
with no breath of life anymore
May your ambition lead you to the unholy name
So my soul will fight you forever
in one of the many new hells

From the holy sea of golden flames
flies the last winged unicorn
With its magic breath of innocence
rising to the crystal throne

Skies are spitting holy fire wisdom cries and deadly whispers flow
Flow down to silent mystic shores
Shores of spirits thirst for vengeance waiting for their holy crystal gate
Gate to the sunny holy lands

"Lands of a timeless world...
an enchanted timeless world like no other...
there where magic flowers paint the cosmic landscape
and noone knows the word... pain!"
Tears of blood and sadness formed the wonderful silent lake
Swans and birds in water games will call Airin's name... her name!

And now is the time to decide
on a way to escape from the cavern
the old silver chains on the wall
are now also trapping their souls
Airin my princess I can not endure all my pain
but I swear to you on my proud name...
you'll open the mystical gate!

From the holy sea of golden flames
flies the last winged unicorn
With its magic breath of innocence
rising to the crystal throne

10. The Mighty Ride Of The Firelord
[Turilli / Staropoli]

Cruel Akron bloody bastard I now spit on you
You can turn my bones to black ash but I'll move the moon
I will light your evil kingdom
and your heart will burn in flames
Mutilated or dismembered
we'll soon rise to eat your brain
You will pay for your victims and for Airin's bloody rape
For Arwald my dear friend and all my crying wasted land
I call the rage of my dead
I call the black angels' tears

Also Dargor can't endure all... goes out from the cave
while the demons take the hero for their tragic game
Gods of earth save me from madness
from these rites of total shame
while descending in the red flame
Arwald dies but not in vain
They will pay for this nightmare, for the symphony of pain
For Airin, my dead friend and all my crying wasted land
I call the Tharos' fire
I call the thunder roar

Raise your voice and ride all
ride all brave, raise your sword to the sky
and sing the epic symphony
for the mighty and proud firelord

Arwald's acid broke the silver chains
before his very last breath
Akron laughing really doesn't know what now waits for him...
Gods are raging leading my red steel
heads and limbs are falling down
It's in me the mystic messenger bringer of revenge
"Black angel, I call you! King Chaos is raging
in the torment of my heart...
I call the holy earthquake to end this bloody hell!"
Gods are raging leading my red steel
heads and limbs are falling down
It's in me the mystic messenger bringer of revenge
while she comes, beloved sunlight

On the river known as Aigor
our hero found his way
All the demons desperately
search for him now but in vain
They will pay for this nightmare, for the symphony of pain
For Airin, my dead friend and all my crying wasted land
I call the Tharos' fire
I call the thunder roar

Raise your voice and ride all
ride all brave, raise your sword to the sky
and sing the epic symphony
for the mighty and proud firelord

The fading illusion the sirens' grey tears
it's here in the cold air the town's tragic fear
The breath of infernos the rise of the dead
the portals of chaos the seventh black flame

(RIDE) Destino (KNIGHT) mi arrendo
...al tuo dominio del tempo!

IN THIS BLOODY DAWN
I WILL WASH MY SOUL
TO CALL THE SPIRIT OF VENGEANCE

3. The Power Of The Dragonflame
Rise mighty dragon...

Rise, rise, rise, rise...
Mighty dragon rise!

Ruins of ancient wisdom closing now my darkest lonely eye
god is dead in Thorald and in Elnor's rhyme
Mutilated bodies are now carved in ancient holy stone
tragic decoration of unholy wars

The heart of the dragon is screaming awaiting
to write the black last page
The page of blood was written by them...
the dead now lying on the sand

Visions of disaster are now challenging the wild storms
cyclops of the midlands wash my bloody shore
Sirens from the open seas now heal my broken wounded brain
I call the holy typhoons... air, fire, earth!

The heart of the dragon is screaming awaiting
to write the black last page
The page of blood was written by them...
the dead now lying on the sand

FROM THE SILENT HILL WE SCREAM LOUD YOUR NAME
MIGHTY POWER OF THE DRAGONFLAME
FROM THE MOUNTAINS PROUD AND STRONG
WE CALL OUR DRAGONLORD

Mighty dragon rise... rise!

Energie di cosmi estinti gridano sangue
dalle terre dell'ignoto senza pieta'

The heart of the dragon is screaming awaiting
to write the black last page
The page of blood was written by them...
the dead now lying on the sand

FROM THE SILENT HILL WE SCREAM LOUD YOUR NAME
MIGHTY POWER OF THE DRAGONFLAME
FROM THE MOUNTAINS PROUD AND STRONG
WE CALL OUR DRAGONLORD

4. The March Of The Swordmaster
Ride... die... sacrifice!

Along the river of bloody tears
the mighty steel shining in my hands
we march and honor our brothers
victims of Kron's evil plan

We cross the lakes of the holy woods
to reach the ocean where red waves rule
the black king is moving to Algalord
this is the time... he has to be stopped!

HAIL, HAIL!
...Brave Swordmaster!
MARCH, MARCH!
...Great Swordmaster!
and I ask the wind for the fall of the king...!

INTO THE RAY OF THE SUN
MARCH OUR HERO HUNTING THE DARKLORD
REBORN FROM THE BLOOD OF HIS GOD...
HIS GOD... THE WARMASTER KRON
RIDE FOR THE FALL OF HIS POWER
FIGHTING THE STORM, THE ROAR OF THE THUNDER
ALLY OF THE SUN AND THE MOON...
GREAT SWORDMASTER RULE!

Between the waves of the raging sea
echoes of warcries and battle hymns
the underworld's armies found their ancient queen
the funeral march in the depths of the abyss

The terror which strikes the honor which prays
will be face to face in the mortal doomsday
Resist my fierce soldiers their vision can kill
it will test your courage... and your will to live

HAIL, HAIL!
...Brave Swordmaster!
MARCH, MARCH!
...Great Swordmaster!
and I ask the wind for the fall of the king...!

INTO THE RAY OF THE SUN
MARCH OUR HERO HUNTING THE DARKLORD
REBORN FROM THE BLOOD OF HIS GOD...
HIS GOD... THE WARMASTER KRON
RIDE FOR THE FALL OF HIS POWER
FIGHTING THE STORM, THE ROAR OF THE THUNDER
ALLY OF THE SUN AND THE MOON...
GREAT SWORDMASTER RULE!

To avenge all those cries I will rise to the sky
to defend mother life...
Ride... die... sacrifice!

5. When Demons Awake
Oh god don't forsake me, I need to survive
the unholy vision, the eternal bloody night
He pronounced the rites, the slimy queen's awake
the cause is the sword, my sword in Akron's hands
The vomit of evil, the venom of death
is crashing my wisdom, is blocking my legs
They all suck the blood, have ecstasy in pain
eating their flesh, devouring their brains

Dead and vampires spit out from hell...
is the new legion of the lord of the damned
The vengeance of the gods, soon their heads will roll
Oh, bringer of chaos... you will pay for all!
Bowels' rain around me, brothers mutilated
oh disfigured faces, flying army and bones
Fuck you bloody bastard, demon's raped soul
die into oblivion with your shitty sons

I'M THE NORDIC WARRIOR
HUNTER OF THE MARCHING DEAD
I'M THE BLOODY HAND OF TYTANS
WHEN... WHEN DEMONS AWAKE

Inferno apri rubami l'anima
voglio sfidare l'oscuro demone
Tutto e' in me, cielo e oceani
fratelli gargoyles, volate qui da me

Oh god don't forsake me, I need to survive
the unholy vision, the eternal bloody night
He pronounced the rites, the slimy queen's awake
the cause is the sword, my sword in Akron's hands
The vomit of evil, the venom of death
is crashing my wisdom, is blocking my legs
They all suck the blood, have ecstasy in pain
eating their flesh, devouring their brains

I'M THE NORDIC WARRIOR
HUNTER OF THE MARCHING DEAD
I'M THE BLOODY HAND OF TYTANS
WHEN... WHEN DEMONS AWAKE

6. Agony Is My Name
One for the pain and two for my name
three for my wonderful kingdom
Four for my king, five for my queen
Six for the fall of my wisdom...
Earth's calling me!

VITA, MORTE, GLORIA, ONORE...
Airin, Arwald, Tharos in my painful dreams

Horror and death crossing my way
paint all the unreal landscape
Villages burn, the black fire runs...
runs through the heart of the forest...
killing my trees!

VITA, MORTE, GLORIA, ONORE...
Spazio e tempo play the rhymes of human lies!

ALGALORD'S CALLING FOR HOLY REVENGE
THE RAGE OF THE HEROES IN MY HANDS
THE FURY WILL RISE AND SOON
THEY WILL TASTE MY SILVER BLADE
AND THEY WILL FACE THE PROPHECY
'CAUSE AGONY IS... MY NAME!

Black is the rose that's now in my hand
black for the blood of the fallen
symbol of death will soon be reborn
into the life of my tears' fall...
reborn and grow!

VITA, MORTE, GLORIA, ONORE...
Silent cries of children in my painful dreams

ALGALORD'S CALLING FOR HOLY REVENGE
THE RAGE OF THE HEROES IN MY HANDS
THE FURY WILL RISE AND SOON
THEY WILL TASTE MY SILVER BLADE
AND THEY WILL FACE THE PROPHECY
'CAUSE AGONY IS... MY NAME!

Quantus tremor est futurus,
quando judex est venturus...
quantus tremor est futurus,
...est venturus!

VITA, MORTE, GLORIA, ONORE...
Spazio e tempo play the rhymes of human lies!

ALGALORD'S CALLING FOR HOLY REVENGE
THE RAGE OF THE HEROES IN MY HANDS
THE FURY WILL RISE AND SOON
THEY WILL TASTE MY SILVER BLADE
AND THEY WILL FACE THE PROPHECY
'CAUSE AGONY IS... MY NAME!

7. Lamento Eroico
Langue in me l'eco infranto
al truce sguardo dell'angelo cieco
rovina in me l'antica rima
nel cuor del cigno ferito e morente...

Cosmi di eternita' tradita
di verita' svanite che ora versano
lacrime d'addio in un vuoto nero...
sincero e fiero al mio destino andro'...

URLA IL TUONO
AL MIO LAMENTO EROICO
SORTE... CONSUMA LA REALTA'!

Spiriti di mondi arcani
chiedo la vita al di la' della morte
per allinear le stelle amiche
e diventar guardiano celeste

Custode di eternita' guarita
di verita' trovate per tutti i figli di madre terra...
sempre a lei ho dato la vita... la morte...
cosi' continuero'!

URLA IL TUONO
AL MIO LAMENTO EROICO
SORTE... CONSUMA LA REALTA'!

[ENGLISH TRANSLATION:]

[Heroic lament]

Languishes in me the broken echo
at the grim look of the blind angel
ruins in me the ancient rhyme
in the heart of the wounded, dying swan

Worlds of betrayed eternity
Of vanished truth, that are now shedding
Tears of farewell into a black void
Proud and sincere, I'll go (to meet) my destiny

[Chorus]
The thunder cries
my heroic lament,
fate ... consume reality.

Spirits of arcane worlds
I ask for life beyond death
To align the friendly stars
And to become a celestial guardian

Keeper of healed eternity
Of truth found for all children of mother earth
Always to her I have always given (my) life. (my) death.
thus I will continue.

[Chorus]
The thunder cries
my heroic lament,
fate ... consume reality.

8. Steelgods Of The Last Apocalypse
Soon... winter again...
...snowlord come...
Come and cover those grey walls...

...VIOLENCE CALLS!
I want his fall...
his epic fall... in this evil war...
...fought to protect our ancient throne

From this grey prison I look at you
my lost and beloved wasted holy town
I call the prophecy's miracle
the thunder of the ancient book's word

WE ARE...
WE ARE THE ONES...
WHO'LL FACE THE STEELGODS
OF THIS LAST APOCALYPSE...
...OF THE LAST APOCALYPSE!

Now... Algalord lies...
in the shades...
of my shy mystic rainbow...

...VIOLENCE CALLS!
I want his fall...
his epic fall... in this evil war...
...trapped behind these humid walls

Raise all your eyes to the autumn skies
capture the energy of that sight
They can have fun with my limbs and bones
but I swear my spirit will never fall

WE ARE...
WE ARE THE ONES...
WHO'LL FACE THE STEELGODS
OF THIS LAST APOCALYPSE...
...OF THE LAST APOCALYPSE!

9. The Pride Of The Tyrant
Back into the fire I will have my sword
He won one fight but not the total war
Hurricanes will wipe out the dynasty of Kron
The chains of steel can't hold the holy storm

Sunshine is lighting the ruins of the ancient town
the seven towers are screaming their pain so loud
With my eagles I'll fly free
from snowy mountains to crystal seas

WE WILL FLY TO THE EMPIRE OF STEELGODS
TO DISCOVER THE SECRET OF STORMS
AND AGAINST THE BLACK PRIDE OF THE TYRANT
WE'LL USE IT TO DEFEND OUR THRONE

Dargor don't believe him... listen to my words!
You are the one who can still save your soul
Akron is the bastard... he massacred all
The evil hand that serves the will of Kron

You hate the tyrant as I and now don't deny
Give me the power to show you that I am right
With my eagles I'll fly free
from snowy mountains to crystal seas

WE WILL FLY TO THE EMPIRE OF STEELGODS
TO DISCOVER THE SECRET OF STORMS
AND AGAINST THE BLACK PRIDE OF THE TYRANT
WE'LL USE IT TO DEFEND OUR THRONE

Seven flames to not forget, to be sure I'll not regret... ever!
...to become the rage of god... Chaos bringer worse than Kron...
beware!

Back into the fire I will have my sword
He won one fight but not the total war
Dargor don't believe him... listen to my words!
You are the one who can still save your soul

You hate the tyrant as I and now don't deny
Give me the power to show you that I am right
With my eagles I'll fly free
from snowy mountains to crystal seas

WE WILL FLY TO THE EMPIRE OF STEELGODS
TO DISCOVER THE SECRET OF STORMS
AND AGAINST THE BLACK PRIDE OF THE TYRANT
WE'LL USE IT TO DEFEND OUR THRONE

10. Rise From The Sea Of Flames
[limited edition bonus track]

[written by: Luca Turilli / Alex Staropoli]

Mirror of tragic reflections
I'll break your glass showing pain
pain for the infernal vision
pain for that red bloody rain
Trapped in this lonely oblivion
dishonoured by acts not to name
I search for answers forgotten
trying not to become insane

Baptized in fire is the dark knight who rides in me
against the raging wind

RISE FROM THE WIDE SEA OF FLAMES
TO THE VALLEYS OF ETERNITY
RISE FROM THE WIDE SEA OF FLAMES
TO LEAD ME AGAINST THE ENEMY
FOR THE RUIN OF THE KING

Hope of dark stone are now falling
under attack of the ghouls
crashing the high dragons' tower
witness of legend untold
My brothers run through the grey streets
not spared by the queen's deadly call
some throw themselves from the high walls
denying the torture of soul

Baptized in fire is the dark knight who rides in me
against the raging wind

RISE FROM THE WIDE SEA OF FLAMES
TO THE VALLEYS OF ETERNITY
RISE FROM THE WIDE SEA OF FLAMES
TO LEAD ME AGAINST THE ENEMY
FOR THE RUIN OF THE KING

11. Gargoyles, Angels Of Darkness
[I. Angeli di Pietra Mistica]

The prophet told of loud thunders quaking the surface of earth
when the black raven would have turned victim of wonderful spells
He would have become a white swan born from the darklands of sin
Neither would Aresius have believed what was now changing in him
Swan... prince of the magic lake... Dargor's your name...

GARGOYLES, FLY
GARGOYLES, RISE
GARGOYLES, FLY HIGH...!
ANGELI DI PIETRA MISTICA
LADRI D'ANIME FIERI VOLANO

Another mess of vampires, masquerade of sadistic pride
He could not endure these cruel games
against him who once spared its life
He realized so not too late to be really far from his king
far from his infinite blood thirst, too far to call them right for him
Rise... fly high and steal his soul... angels of stone...

GARGOYLES, FLY
GARGOYLES, RISE
GARGOYLES, FLY HIGH...!
ANGELI DI PIETRA MISTICA
LADRI D'ANIME FIERI VOLANO

Ti invoco o terra... colora il mio nero...
con fiera lealta' io giuro sincero...
tra anime morte e caos immenso
a Gaia sovrana l'amore piu' intenso... io Dargor a te...

Gargoyles, oh my brother gargoyles
Rise now, rise for his soul

[II. Exotic Interlude (instrumental)]

[III. ...And the Legend Ends...]

Dargor, do it... it must be done...
free your rage and light your soul...
It's Gaia's call...

...the powerful energies of the furthest secret cosmos heard
so the prayer of our mother Gaia, the supreme spirit
who gave us the miracle of life... and her dark son breathed new life...
The power of the dragonflame was realizing what had seemed to be impossible...

And this is then the epic end
of the legendary tale
of the one who found the light
and the dragonflame inside
of the tragic rain of a thousand flames
of the town's defenders who faced pain
of symphonies of enchanted lands
of whispers of love and hate

The dawn of victory can breathe in the wind
and this would mean the great rebirth
reborn, the one who's giving his life
...the towns lying on the ground
Be one (Be one!) of us (of us!) and
act as all the prophecies want...
To mountains and valleys, to fire and snow,
to sun, moon and wisdom rise your soul...
it's the call...!

Oh no, oh god, oh god no
What is happening?

ANGELI DI PIETRA MISTICA
LADRI D'ANIME FIERI VOLANO
ANGELI DI PIETRA MISTICA
LADRI D'ANIME FIERI VOLANO

Oh, god, my god...
it happened... it happened!

Dargor mortally struck the queen of the dead and called the mighty gargoyles against the legions of darkness...
He pushed Akron into the hands of the nordic warrior, now a dying victim of terrible tortures... the chosen one let himself fall into the deep marshes constraining the black king, with the emerald sword again in his hands, not to move... they became food for the snakes of the abyss...
But this sacrifice had a terrific and great effect and Akron's death meant the victory on the evil forces of abyss... once... forever...
Remember, proud brothers... everything is possible... when you let the mystic power of the dragonflame burn in your heart... believe it... ...it's the dragonflame!

May there be misery for you, king of darkness
From the beginning to your holy end
Cruel fights and epic fury
Against disciples of darkness

For the eternal glory of the light
The everlasting furious rage
Against injustice and ruin
The eternal furious rage

May there be misery for you, king of darkness
Cruel king.

2. Warrior Of Ice
Demons of abyss wait for my pride
on wings of glory I'll fly brave and wild
I'll stop your madness your thirst for blood
to bring them peace where love must reign

A while ago the elder told dark will fall again
my land will see the light no more my beloved Algalord
My horse run wild the beast is back to conquer my reign
the sea the hills rivers and lakes call my holy name

Fight your holy war raise your mighty sword and ride
You're the chosen face the evil son of holy ice

Mighty warrior for the legend ride again
from the hills for peace and love to the sea of gold
my land must be free

I cross the forest of the elves while my heart pounds fast
sky is grey wind no more time has stopped its race
My horse run wild the beast is back to conquer my reign
the sea the hills rivers and lakes call my holy name

Fight your holy war raise your mighty sword and ride
You're the chosen face the evil son of holy ice

Mighty warrior for the legend ride again
from the hills for peace and love to the sea of gold
my land must be free

March to hell Irengard brothers
together we'll face the flames fearless and brave
on the grass where blood we'll shed
flowers of real hope will bud again
And on the grass where blood we'll shed
flowers of hope will bud again

Now leave your castles united we'll be strong
I'll lead you to this holy war to save all our thrones
to give our people the joy to be free
to see our beloved sun shine again

Mighty warrior for the legend ride again
from the hills for peace and love to the sea of gold
my land must be free

3. Rage Of The Winter
Cold is the winter snow falls down
mystical lights dance in the sky to the winds of night
Spell of the nature fill all my soul
kiss with your wonderful song my land with love

Rage of the winter mould the horizon
cover the mountains forest and lakes
Rage of the winter magical wonder
enchanted fury majestic force

There are no words to describe the poetry of landscape
I can receive all the magic that my season gives
Tears of winter falling on me freezing my dark side
my heart must be wide fair full light eyes

Rage of the winter mould the horizon
cover the mountains forest and lakes
Rage of the winter magical wonder
enchanted fury majestic force

Cold is the winter snow falls down
mystical lights dance in the sky to the winds of night
Spell of the nature cross my heart fill all my soul
kiss with your wonderful song my land with love

Rage of the winter mould the horizon
cover the mountains forest and lakes
Rage of the winter magical wonder
enchanted fury majestic force

4. Forest Of Unicorns
Run holy beloved horse
on this peaceful day
through these valleys kissed by light
where peace is so rare

So hardy trees let me hear your words
about those memories
please tell me all about our hold
and epic battles they won

Beware of unholy fire
my guardian of the trees
their flames can't burn the memory
the wisdom of the kings
The secrets of this forest
the ride of unicorns
are treasures of these valleys
where freedom has its throne
where love must reign eternally
avoiding acts of war

We must have all their valour
to defend these lands
or the sun in these valleys
will not shine again

Beware of unholy fire
my guardian of the trees
their flames can't burn the memory
the wisdom of the kings
The secrets of this forest
the ride of unicorns
are treasures of these valleys
where freedom has its throne
where love must reign eternally
avoiding acts of war

5. Flames Of Revenge
My princess why must I assist at your death
I can't endure this tragic pain
now I close your eyes while thunder strikes the sky
I cry to see the innocent die
Brothers I'm ready the ride can begin
for you I must win

Now the time has come farewell my dear old friends
Ancelot is calling for my help
From the sun of Elgard to the middle plains
for salvation of enchanted lands
I'm looking forward to avenge all those killed
to be face to face

Fire and steel
follow me through my lands
you will burn hordes of hell
in the deadly raging flames of revenge

Come out from your abyss her tears seek revenge
for this cruel tragedy flames are burning high

Brothers I'm ready the ride can begin
for you I must win

Fire and steel
follow me through my lands
you will burn hordes of hell
in the deadly raging flames of revenge

6. Virgin Skies

7. Land Of Immortals
Hear the silence of the winds making your own destiny
go and face the mirror of their sin
Only brave hearts found the way breaking all the dragon's spell
cross the Argon's glade with heart in hand

Land of immortals I wait for my day
to reach the wisdom of your skies
Land of immortals you must belong to me
from here to eternity

And between Elgard's hills near the ancient ruins of Kron
you will face the trick of the old dwarf
To obtain the second key you have to cross the bloody sea
where the thirst of Tharos never ends

Land of immortals I wait for my day
to reach the wisdom of your skies
Land of immortals you must belong to me
from here to eternity

Holy force of wisdom spread through all the air
I shall breathe you forever to end this epic holy quest
My way will be hard but I would do all
to reach the valleys where true heroes ride
beyond the ivory gates

Land of immortals I wait for my day
to reach the wisdom of your skies
Land of immortals you must belong to me
from here to eternity

8. Echoes Of Tragedy
Where sun creates shadow's games
where tragic echoes speak of death why Lord why
between the ruins through lakes of holy blood
I walk in tears for my wasted land

Echoes of tragedy carved on my steel
in this neverending fight against the beast
soldiers of twilight turn back to hell
burn in your fire or glory for me will be your end

Mothers and children embraced in blood
torture and rape will leave their sign
after the sorrow I call the holy rage
burn in my heart now flames of blind hate

Echoes of tragedy carved on my steel
in this neverending fight against the beast
soldiers of twilight turn back to hell
burn in your fire or glory for me will be your end

9. Lord Of The Thunder
Born in the time of darkness and evil under the sign of God
glory's my mother fire's my brother sword my only law
Into the land of chaos and hate there is no place for me
and for the conquest of justice and honour I will use my steel

Holy flame burn again for eternity burn my heart to win
the holy war is awaiting another fiery king

Rage in my heart crossing the forest riding my black horse
across the valley along the river where the hot blood flows
Over the lakes and over the hills I follow the call of the wind
uphold the legend and for my princess I will fight and win

Holy flame burn again for eternity burn my heart to win
the holy war is awaiting another fiery king

Lord of the thunder please be my guide
before and after my last ride
I'll be your soldier serving the light
riding forever alive and proud

Holy flame burn again for eternity burn my heart to win
the holy war is awaiting another fiery king

Lord of the thunder please be my guide
before and after my last ride
I'll be your soldier serving the light
riding forever alive and proud

10. Legendary Tales
And darkness covers all the land
the silent river flows
the jesters dance around the flame
playing an ancient song

A song of mighty warriors
of epic bloody fights
while moonlight meets the manor's walls
and I must close my eyes

Another tale of infinite wars
for the defenders of holy light
the fire enters my mind
the blood of the innocent before my eyes
spreading the wings of the dream
I want to win between fire and steel
for them all

Some knights sleep near fire
drowned in their own red wine
the elder looks at the high flame
knowing the fight will reprise

The magic twittering of the birds
meets the light of dawn
the ancient song is fading now
but my old dream carries on

Another tale of infinite wars
for the defenders of holy light
the fire enters my mind
the blood of the innocent before my eyes
spreading the wings of the dream
I want to win between fire and steel
for them all

1. Emerald Sword
[Turilli]

I crossed the valleys the dust of midlands
to search for the third key to open the gates
Now I?m near the altar the secret inside
as legend told my beloved sun light the dragon?s eyes
On the way to the glory I?ll honor my sword
to serve right and justice for all

Finally happened the sun lit their eyes
the spell was creating strange games of light
Thanks to hidden mirrors I found my lost way
over the stones I reached the place it was a secret cave
In a long bloody battle that prophecies told
the light will prevail hence wisdom is gold

For the king for the land for the mountains
for the green valleys where dragons fly
for the glory the power to win the black lord
I will search for the emerald sword
 
Only a warrior with a clear heart
could have the honor to be kissed by the sun
Yes, I?m that warrior I followed my way
led by the force of cosmic soul I can reach the sword
On the way to the glory I?ll honor my sword
to serve right ideals and justice for all

For the king for the land for the mountains
for the green valleys where dragons fly
for the glory the power to win the black lord
I will search

2. Where Dragons Flymm
[Turilli]

The way is long, time is too short
this little footpath seems never to end
Green are the trees, musk on the stones
how it looks strange this mystical world
Sweet smelling rose what do you hide
behind your innocence red like my blood

Hungry for victory, hungry for love
love for the earth that made her son
strong and invincible serving my cry
go now and ride there where dragons fly 
The rocks appear in front of me
when the first shadows pretude to dark
Near is your end wild holy path
open my eyes to what the sun hides
Beloved mountain what do you hide
Where does your river flow, I want to know

Hungry for victory, hungry for love
love for the earth that made her son
strong and invincible serving my cry
go now and ride there where dragons fly

3. Land Of Immortals
[Turilli/Staropoli]

Hear the silence of the winds making 
your own destiny go and face the 
mirror of their sin Only brave hearts 
found the way breaking all the 
dragon's spell cross the Argon's
glade with heart in hand
Land of immortals I wait for my day 
to reach the wisdom of your skies 
Land of immortals you must belong 
to me from here to eternity

And between Elgard's hills near the 
ancient ruins of Kron you will face 
the trick of the old dwarf To obtain 
the second key you have to cross them 
bloody sea where the thirst of Tharos 
never ends
 
Land of immortals I wait for my day 
to reach the wisdom of your skies 
Land of immortals you must belong
to me from here to eternity
Holy force of wisdom spread through
all the air I shall breathe you forever
to end this epic holy quest My way 
will be hard but I would do all to reach 
the valleys where true heroes ride 
beyond the ivory gates

Land of immortals I wait for my day to 
reach the wisdom of your skies Land 
of immortals you must belong to me 
from here to eternity

RHAPSODY LYRICS


1. The Dark Secret
[I. The Ancient Prophecy]

"It was a good time for all creatures of the earth, but fate decreed that the dark prophecy of a demon knight could bring a tragic end to this peace
scarring their lives forever. Shortly before his defeat in the last of the primordial wars between the heavens and hells the evil son of the Hell God Kron,
known as Nekron, withdrew to his lair in the underworld.
There, sensing his impending death he inscribed a testament of pure evil in seven black books. One by one six of these books were discovered through out
the ages, however the seventh, last and most terrible of all contained the secret of his resurrection.
He commanded seven immortal demons to carry out his dark plan.
But they were turned into stone by the angels of the crystal realms.
And so his dreams slept with them until a time came when the forces of evil would usurp the earth.
Nekron would rule in the unholy name! of cosmic chaos.
And this time he would reign supreme!"

[II. Ira Divina]

Ira divina
A dolore nunc libera nos
Tacet rota temporis
Nunc est silentium
Sempiternus angelus
A malo libera nos
A malo

2. Unholy Warcry
IN THE DARK LIES A SECRET
IN THE MYSTIC SEVENTH BLACK BOOK
NEKRON'S DARK WORDS
HE IS KRON, KRON'S DISCIPLE
HE IS SWORN TO RETURN
TO AVENGE THE LOST DIVINE WARS

Algalord arise, greater than before
time of peace, not of war
Shouts of freedom from the castle's walls
Freedom in the land and
hope for all

INTO THE SILENT, DARK AND FORGOTTEN
CAVES OF DAR-KUNOR
DEEP IN THE SECRET BOOK IS AWAITING
UNHOLY WARCRY
NEKRON PROMISED BLOODY TERROR
BRINGING DEATH AND HATE TO THE NEW WORLD

From the rocky mountains to the golden sea
to the barbarians' sacred hills
From the icy north and misty lakes
to the walls of Seth and elvish plains
all beware!

INTO THE SILENT, DARK AND FORGOTTEN
CAVES OF DAR-KUNOR
DEEP IN THE SECRET BOOK IS AWAITING
UNHOLY WARCRY
NEKRON PROMISED BLOODY TERROR
BRINGING DEATH AND HATE TO THE NEW WORLD

Torment, pain and bloody rain... Nekron's resurrection
They must kill the demon king or fight another war

"Only one person could crossed the darklands surrounding Hargor
and venture forth deep into the caves of Dar-Kunor...
His is a name the world will never forget...
He is Dargor!"

He is the chosen one
he walked out through the darkness
he met the wisdom's light
chosen to find the last dark rhymes
the last rhymes of hell

HE IS KRON, KRON'S DISCIPLE
HE IS SWORN TO RETURN
TO AVENGE THE LOST DIVINE WARS

There was only one who knew the way
he lived in the dark, lonely caves
the demon of the night could save the day
should they take a chance or run away...
Dargor was his name!

INTO THE SILENT, DARK AND FORGOTTEN
CAVES OF DAR-KUNOR
DEEP IN THE SECRET BOOK IS AWAITING
UNHOLY WARCRY
NOW THEY SWORE TO BAND TOGETHER
ON A SACRED JOURNEY
CALLED BY FATE, TIME TO BE GREAT
UNHOLY WARCRY
NEKRON PROMISED BLOODY TERROR
BRINGING DEATH AND HATE TO THE NEW WORLD

3. Never Forgotten Heroes
Autumn is kissing valleys and hills
shy Falin welcome me
old trees are speaking to the holy wind
about ancient memories

Sense of infinity prelude to memory
in the mystic Elgard's forest
echoes their voice

Airin 'the rose', Arwald 'the rock'
great example of pure love
warrior of ice thank you for all
from the creatures of the world

All kneel before you dear old Aresius
we lived thousand great adventures
kept in my dreams

FLY TO THE CRYSTAL SKY
GLORIOUS AND PROUD
NEVER FORGOTTEN FRIENDS OF ALL
HEROES OF THE WHOLE KNOWN WORLD
MAY YOUR FIRE BURN IN OUR HEARTS
AND LET THE LEGEND SURVIVE

4. Elgard's Green Valleys
[Instrumental]

5. The Magic Of The Wizard's Dream
[Iras:]
In those silent shades of grey
I will find a place
to escape the endless night
to find a new sun

I know which is my fate
bond to Erian's old tale
I'll be always there
fighting the ancient sin
Moon shine in this eternal night

ANGELS ARE CALLING
FROM DIVINE LOST CRYSTAL REALMS
RIDING FROM HEAVEN
FOR THE MAGIC OF THE WIZARD'S DREAM

In the misty lights of dawn
between heart and soul
Elgard's calling for new hope
to avoid our fall

I know which is my fate
bond to Erian's old tale
I'll be always there
fighting the ancient sin
Moon shine in this eternal night

ANGELS ARE CALLING
FROM DIVINE LOST CRYSTAL REALMS
RIDING FROM HEAVEN
FOR THE MAGIC OF THE WIZARD'S DREAM

6. Erian's Mystical Rhymes
IN PRIMORDIAL TIMES OF SORROW
ANCIENT AGES OF THE KNOWN WORLD
KRON'S REIGN OF TERROR WAS RISING
SO THE SKYLORDS SENT THEIR ANGELS
AGAINST THE STORM THAT TREATHENED HEAVENS
SEVEN WARS WERE SO FOUGHT
THE DEAD ROSE
LED BY THE DARKLORDS OF HELL

The last war
meant the end
of hellgod's
old reign

Dark memories lost in the shades of illusion
warn the light of electric sky
the angels could change the life on earth
but not the demons' old plans

United force of strong wise men...
a new order soon was born
ten kings, ten wizards, elves and dragonlords
ready to fight for their world

Ready to face the last secret
hidden for 5000 angels' years
5000 years

A great and new hope in Elgard was born
the one hope that could finally find the

SACRED WORDS TO STOP THE DARK PLAN OF NEKRON
ALL CONTAINED IN ERIAN'S MYSTICAL WHITE BOOK

The holy council cast their vote
hearing the deep voice of soul
Etherus... Iras... two names on all
elected to face the darklord

They knew so well Erian's tale
what could be found between his rhymes
his rhymes of divine light
written to save our lands

Ready to face the last secret
hidden for 5000 angels' years
5000 years

Now is the time for them to share all their plans
the one hope that could finally find the

SACRED WORDS TO STOP THE DARK PLAN OF NEKRON
ALL CONTAINED IN ERIAN'S MYSTICAL WHITE BOOK

So the name was chosen
White Dragon's Order
all sworn to fight
all for one
one for all

A great and new hope in Elgard was born
the one hope that could finally find the

SACRED WORDS TO STOP THE DARK PLAN OF NEKRON
ALL CONTAINED IN ERIAN'S MYSTICAL WHITE BOOK
SACRED WORDS TO STOP THE DARK PLAN OF NEKRON
ALL CONTAINED IN ERIAN'S MYSTICAL WHITE BOOK

- THE WHITE DRAGON'S ORDER

[Iras:]
"And so the Order of the White Dragon decreed Khaas the hero of the middle lands. He and princess Lothen from the kingdom of the ancient waterfalls,
together with Tharish, elven king of the caverns and myself, Iras Algor from Hor-Lad, would travel the path of incredible danger and great adventure.
Dargor the shadowlord would lead us through the ancient underworld of Dar-Kunor. Finally the time had come to find the legendary seventh black book, that
containing the worst of all the known prophecies"

7. The Last Angels' Call
After five long days the final plan
the wise words of Iras convinced all of them
The path to Erloria could be a safer way
to reach the grey mountains, Dar-Kunor's old caves

Epic horizons, majestic falls
green golden valleys moving to north

SEVEN WIZARDS CAME FROM DISTANT LANDS
TO MEET KINGS, DWARFS, ELVES AND DRAGONLORDS
ELGARD'S EYE CAN SEE THE FEAR OF THE WORLD
IT'S THE LAST DRAMATIC ANGELS' CALL

King Uriel proclaimed the last holy words
the new sun was rising... it was time to go
May the wise angels give them the strength
to face all the fears that the darkness awakes

From the high towers the people acclaim
the chosen heroes now crossing the gates

SEVEN WIZARDS CAME FROM DISTANT LANDS
TO MEET KINGS, DWARFS, ELVES AND DRAGONLORDS
ELGARD'S EYE CAN SEE THE FEAR OF THE WORLD
IT'S THE LAST DRAMATIC ANGELS' CALL

8. Dragonland's Rivers
They began a magical journey
to the ancient dragonland
For ten days they walked through majestic woods
their vision ever at hand

THE DRAGONS FLY IN THE BLUE SKIES
THE MOUNTAINS SHOW THEIR MIGHT
STANDING IN THE HEART OF THE LAND
WHAT A SIGHT!

See the deer, trolls and wolves, lovely creatures
they're guardians of this land
Such wonder and beauty lives in their hearts
to see is to understand

THE DRAGONS FLY IN THE BLUE SKIES
THE MOUNTAINS SHOW THEIR MIGHT
STANDING IN THE HEART OF THE LAND
WHAT A SIGHT!
THE RIVER WILL LEAD THEM TO URIEN
THE MYSTICAL HOME OF THE GODS
NOW A MASS OF RUINS BECAUSE OF THE LAST WAR

SEE THE FALLS OF ERLORIA
THE GREY MOUNTAINS ARE NEAR
DARK SHADOWS FALLING
DAYLIGHT'S END IS HERE
AND ALL THE CREATURES OF DARKNESS
THEY WARN US IN THE NIGHT
IN THE DARKLAND THERE IS DANGER
THERE'S EVIL THERE TO FIGHT

9. Sacred Power Of Raging Winds
"NAIRA... ORIEL...TARNA...
Majestic winds of the northlands...
protect our heroes from the deadly Naroth...
cover their tracks with snow...
Rage on with all your fury...
NAIRA... TARNA... ORIEL-NIRNAAN..."

Dark is the way to the mountains of grey
breath turns to ice in the air
The journey is painful and longer than life
crossing the rocks in the night

GODS, LEAD THEM ALL
TO HARGOR'S WALLS
SACRED POWER OF RAGING WINDS
KEEP AWAY FROM THE BLACK ORDER'S STEEL
(THEIR BLACK STEEL, THEIR DARK WILL)
SACRED POWER OF RAGING WINDS
PLEASE HELP THEM REACH THEIR GOAL
TO HIDE IN THE SNOW
SUN AND MOON HAVE LEFT THEIR BRAVE SONS

In the dangerous peaks they may all find their death
searching for the ancient realm
The worship of darkness is Nekron's desire
His soldiers the Black...
The Black Order sect!

GODS, LEAD THEM ALL
TO HARGOR'S WALLS
SACRED POWER OF RAGING WINDS
KEEP AWAY FROM THE BLACK ORDER'S STEEL
(THEIR BLACK STEEL, THEIR DARK WILL)
SACRED POWER OF RAGING WINDS
PLEASE HELP THEM REACH THEIR GOAL
TO HIDE IN THE SNOW
DARGOR'S PAST APPEARS BEFORE HIM

[Dargor:]
Father...
are you really wanting my soul?
Your black blood
no longer flows in my veins...
[Vankar:]
Son, you are a betrayer...
You have betrayed me!!
[Dargor:] No!... I don't want to serve your hellish will...
[Vankar:]
You are half demon... never forget that!
You are one of us!
[Dargor:]
I know it well... for this I will pay!
But I will deny you and fight you forever!

Sacred power of raging winds fill their soul
and the shadowlord's heart
In a magical vision Vankar appeared in Dargor's dream
while the four heroes were trying to rest
He was born half demon half man...
he struggled inside but would soon understand
all would be payed with the blood on his hands

GODS, LEAD THEM ALL
TO HARGOR'S WALLS
SACRED POWER OF RAGING WINDS
KEEP AWAY FROM THE BLACK ORDER'S STEEL
(THEIR BLACK STEEL, THEIR DARK WILL)
SACRED POWER OF RAGING WINDS
PLEASE HELP THEM REACH THEIR GOAL
TO HIDE IN THE SNOW
DARGOR'S PAST APPEARS BEFORE HIM
VANKAR'S THIRST FOR BLOODY VENGEANCE
VANKAR LIVES FOR VENGEANCE

10. Guardiani Del Destino
Prodi e fieri all'ultimo sol verso il monte di Erinor
unica via per arrivar la' dove l'aria di morte sa
fango, paludi... resti di un regno che da millenni paura fa
il nero demone urla il suo odio, l'ultima guerra vuol vendicar

Fuoco di liberta'
Fiamma di vecchia eta'
nei lor cuori sveglia l'ardor
contro l'oscurita'
che fu antico mal
primordiale nella sua realta'

UN'ERA DI SANGUE DI OSCURE MEMORIE
RINASCE IN HARGOR PER NUOVO MAL
ELETTI IN ELGARD GUARDIANI DEL FATO
OR SONO E SARANNO I VERI EROI

Solo le aquile osan volar li' oltre il picco tra ovest e nord
Hargor rivela la sua irrealta' che ai lor occhi svela timor
Per madre terra devono andar, sanno che posson pure morir
la roccia e' forte ma lor di piu'... drago leone in animo e cor

Monti dal manto d'or
scoprono verita'
mura e torri immensita'
Grigia maestosita'
Nera epicita'
che in te celi l'antico mal

UN'ERA DI SANGUE DI OSCURE MEMORIE
RINASCE IN HARGOR PER NUOVO MAL
ELETTI IN ELGARD GUARDIANI DEL FATO
OR SONO E SARANNO I VERI EROI

[English translation:]

[Guardians Of Destiny]

Brave and proud at the last sun towards Erinor's mount,
The only way to reach there, where the air smells like death
Mud, marsh... remains of a reign that have been frightening us for millenniums
The black demon screams its hate, he wants to revenge the latest war

Fire of freedom
Flame of ancient times
Awakes the ardor in their hearts
Against the darkness
That was an ancient evil
Primordial in its reality

AN AGE OF BLOOD, OF OBSCURE MEMORIES
REVIVES IN HARGOR FOR A NEW EVIL
ELECTED IN ELGARD GUARDIANS OF FATE
NOW THEY ARE AND THEY WILL BE THE TRUE HEROES

Only the eagles dare to fly there, beyond the peaks between West and North
Hargor reveals its unreality which unveil fear in their eyes
They have to leave for Mother Land, they even know that they may die
the rock is strong but they are even more... a dragon, a lion in soul and heart

Mounts with golden mantle
reveal the truth
walls and towers, immensity
Grey majesty
Black greatness
In you is hidden the ancient evil

AN AGE OF BLOOD, OF OBSCURE MEMORIES
REVIVES IN HARGOR FOR A NEW EVIL
ELECTED IN ELGARD GUARDIANS OF FATE
NOW THEY ARE AND THEY WILL BE THE TRUE HEROES

11. Shadows Of Death
The old elfking Tarish knows well the way
through the caverns
to Dar-Kunor's forgotten entrance
For two days they walked in the wild
on the pathway to darkness
the reason they survived it was Dargor

Finally they saw in the black and evil marsh
There lied the passageway between snakes and hellish mud

SHADOWS OF DEATH
Follow behind into Dar-Kunor caves
SHADOWS OF DEATH
The holy mission of Iras' new friends
FIVE HEROES READY TO DIE
die for the whole world
die to protect
the green of the earth
the green of the earth

Black waters moving are signs - Dar-Kunor's river
the water is cold - the water is cold there
Tarish dived into the marshes
he soon disappeared
into the black icy water
black icy water

Then, when he appeared
they welcome him as heroes do.
he found the caves of the ancient brother elves

SHADOWS OF DEATH
Follow behind into Dar-Kunor caves
SHADOWS OF DEATH
The holy mission of Iras' new friends
FIVE HEROES READY TO DIE
die for the whole world
die to protect
the green of the earth
the green of the earth
the green and the wonderful beloved our Mother Earth

"Now is the time to face the underworld of Dar-Kunor
perhaps never to return alive"

SHADOWS OF DEATH
Follow behind into Dar-Kunor caves
SHADOWS OF DEATH
The holy mission of Iras' new friends
FIVE HEROES READY TO DIE
die for the whole world
die to protect
the green of the earth
the green of the earth
the green and the wonderful beloved Mother of all

12. Nightfall Of The Grey Mountains
Holy angels of eternal light
you who fell in the primordial age
between these dark and grey lonely mountains
who died to protect the green of the earth

For Algalord and Elgard, Thorald and Elnor
for all the towns of the known world
for the icy northlands, the waterfalls' kingdom
the dwarfs' western realms and the whole middle lands

COLD MYSTIC NIGHT - IT FALLS ON THE PLAIN
ON THE GREY MOUNTAINS REIGNS NOW THE SHADE
ANGELS OF LIGHT GIVE THEM THE FAITH
TIME NOW HAS COME
DAR-KUNOR AWAITS

Unknown threat - it fills the dry air
the howling of wolves fades behind them
they try to find rest between the wild rocks
the one they'll soon see can be their last dawn

The angels' lament breaths in the cold winds
whispers of death surround the wide marsh
Dar-Kunor is there to swallow their souls
in front of them another hell's gate

COLD MYSTIC NIGHT - IT FALLS ON THE PLAIN
ON THE GREY MOUNTAINS REIGNS NOW THE SHADE
ANGELS OF LIGHT GIVE THEM THE FAITH
TIME NOW HAS COME
DAR-KUNOR AWAITS

1. Holy Thunderforce
Face me evil bastards, smell the hate of angels
Glory, pride and bloodshed
Cowards and beholders, rapers of my wisdom
Mix of dust and bones
Go back to your abyss, Algalord will not fall
But your heads will soon roll
Test the blade of heroes, fury of the thunder
Hit my golden shield

So we'll fight against the wind 
for the glory of the kings
to defeat the evil enemies
And we'll ride with our lord 
for the power and the throne
in the name of holy thunderforce

Arwald and Aresius with the nordic warrior
On their way to Hargor
Chaos and oblivion, turmoil and disorder
Will have now their name
The last fallen heroes will defeat your forces
Thousand spirits calling
On the furthest mountain I will see your fire
Quenched by holy frost

So we'll fight against the wind 
for the glory of the kings
to defeat the evil enemies
And we'll ride with our lord 
for the power and the throne
in the name of holy thunderforce

2. Dargor, Shadowlord Of The Black Mountain (Extended)
Not so far from the wide dragonland
Where the valleys breathe the smell of dark gate
Dargor is marching with the poor Airin
There where dark has ruled forever for the demonknights

Fire's rising to valleys of death
While shadows are rising from bloody hells
Fire's riding to Hargor, the town
Where evil and terror conquered the clouds

We sing to the wind the legend of the king
To spread out heart to the kingdom of dust
Where heroes are lost, where now reigns the shadowlord

Carved in shadow is his magic throne
Kron disciple, not extreme at all
Gothic his kingdom told by old jesters
Pride and terror live together in his stormy heart

Fire's rising to valleys of death
While shadows are rising from bloody hells
Fire's riding to Hargor, the town
Where evil and terror conquered the clouds

We sing to the wind the legend of the king
To spread out heart to the kingdom of dust
Where heroes are lost, where now reigns the shadowlord
 
Cry with me to fill the crystal sea
Cry for all the victims of these stones
Shed your tears to fill the silent fall
And wash in it your soul

Fire's rising to valleys of death
While shadows are rising from bloody hells
Fire's riding to Hargor, the town
Where evil and terror conquered the clouds

We sing to the wind the legend of the king
To spread out heart to the kingdom of dust
Where heroes are lost, where now reigns the shadowlord

3. Rage Of The Winter (Alt. Version)
Snow on the portals to magic dreams 
there where the old wizard spellbinds his king 
Fire and icelords, the white realm's queen 
are planning the battle between frost and wind 

Rage of the winter mould the horizon 
cover the mountains forest and lakes 
Rage of the winter magical wonder 
enchanted fury majestic force 

In the dark forest the march of black knights... 
echoes of warcry from day until night 
the empire is calling the ride of the brave 
the Loregard warrior.. the black demons' pain 

Rage of the winter mould the horizon 
cover the mountains forest and lakes 
Rage of the winter magical wonder 
enchanted fury majestic force 

Face me Akron king of terror 
Come now here to taste my blade 

Algalord fire burns in his veins 
Master of wisdom, master of faith 
Glorify his name! 

Snow on the portals to magic dreams 
there where the old wizard spellbinds his king 
Fire and icelords, the white realm's queen 
are planning the battle between frost and wind 

Rage of the winter mould the horizon 
cover the mountains forest and lakes 
Rage of the winter magical wonder 
enchanted fury majestic force

4. Guardians
[Helloween cover]

We're living in our units
And one thing we can do is
Work for a life without a fate
We don't pay any taxes
But the state is the axes
Of our minds without love without hate

We have a higher order
No one needs to be a hoarder
Our society is such a glorious thing
In our centers we can dream of
Anything you never think of
You can't say we are puppets on a string

Our minds are kept so clean
Checked up on a screen
They're holy men, they're saints
Without them we might all fail

We don't know war and crime
Things of ancient times
We just see it if we put on video
The blue pass is for my life
And the red one's for my wife
It's the only thing we really need to show

There are still some without rules
But I tell you, they're all fools
The Guardians will find them as we've seen
We got banks where we freeze them
They get new brains screwed in then
And act contrarily to what they have been

With new minds made so clean
Checked up on a screen
They will be the saints
Without them we might all fail

[x2]
Guardians of our lives
Protect security
They turn the key and they step in
Controlling you and me
Guardians of our lives
Take care eternally

1. The Dark Secret
[I : The Ancient Prophecy]

It was a good time for all creatures on the earth,
But fate decreed that the dark prophecy of a demon
Knight could bring a tragic end to this peace
Scarring their lives forever.
Shortly before his defeat in the last of the primordial
Wars between the heavens and hells the evil son
Of the Hell God Kron, known as Nekron, withdrew
To his lair in the underworld. There sensing his
Impending death he inscribed a testament of pure evil
In seven black books. One by one six of these books
Were discovered through the ages, however the
Seventh, last and most terrible of all contained the
Secret of his resurrection.
He commanded seven immortal demons to carry out
His dark plan. But they were turned into stone by
The angels of the crystal realms. And so his dreams
Slept with them until a time came when the forces of
Evilevul would usurp the earth. Nekron would rule in the
Unholy name of cosmic chaos.
And this time he would reign supreme!

[II : Ira Divina]

Ira divina
A dolore nunc libera nos
Tacet rota temporis
Nunc est silentium
Sempiternus angelus
A malo libera nos
A malo

2. Unholy Warcry
The dark lies a secret he is sworn to return to avenge the lost divine wars.

Algalord arise greater than before
Time of peace not of war
Shouts of freedom from the castle walls
Freedom in the land and hope for all
Hope for all

Into the silent dark forgotten
Caves of dark-Kunor
Deep in the secret book is awaiting
Unholy warcry
Nekron promised bloody terror
Bringing death and pain
To the new world

From the rocky mountains
To the golden sea
To the Barbarians' sacred hills
From the icy north and misty lakes
To the walls of Seth and Elvish plains
All beware!

Into the silent dark forgotten
Caves of dark-Kunor
Deep in the secret book is awaiting
Unholy warcry
Nekron promised bloody terror
Bringing death and pain
To the new world

Torment pain and bloody rain
Nekron's resurrection
They must kill the demon king
Or fight another war

"Nekron would rule
In the unholy name of cosmic chaos
And this time he would reign supreme"

He is Kron Kron's disciple
He is sworn to return
To avenge the lost devine wars

There was only one who knew the way
He lived in the dark lonely caves
The demon of the night
Could save the day
Should they take a change or run away
Dargor was his name!

Into the silent dark forgotten
Caves of dark-Kunor
Deep in the secret book is awaiting
Unholy warcry
Now they swore to band together
On a sacred journey
Called by fate time to be great
Unholy warcry
Nekron promised bloody terror
Bringing death and pain
To the new world

3. Wisdom Of The Kings
Removed the stones which hide the cave
Blind and dark along my way
I must go on wise and brave before a last hail
At the end of floor stairs of ancient stone
Lead me to a vision, an unreal hall

And they appear in front of me
Lightened by a mystic flame
A new dimension I have to face beyond the gates
I can not believe on what now I see
When the two demons awake from the sleep

Holy dragons keepers of time
Ride brave the blue skies and spell my eyes
Fly beyond these hills ride on the wind
The wisdom of the kings

Lost in a dream I'm under the spell
Of the sunny magic land
But Aresius said: become aware! all can hide the hell...
Now it's time to go to the mighty sword
It's time to follow the kings holy call

Holy dragons keepers of time
Ride brave the blue skies and spell my eyes
Fly beyond these hills ride on the wind
The wisdom of the kings

4. The Village Of Dwarves
The dwarves of Lark are showing all their honour
When you walk on the Gandor secret hill

The dance for fire and wind
And the stories about old kings
Are pleasing our brave lords
Down in the village of dwarves

The elves are playing under timeless willows
While blue and red paint all my beloved land

The dance for fire and wind
And the stories about old kings
Are pleasing our brave lords
Down in the village of dwarves

The eagle's eye is hiding something tragic
But in this night the red wine rules in me

The dance for fire and wind
And the stories about old kings
Are pleasing our brave lords
Down in the village of dwarves

And all night long me Arwald and Aresius
We speak, we laugh, we honor our king

The dance for fire and wind
And the stories about old kings
Are pleasing our brave lords
Down in the village of dwarves

The eagle's eye is hiding something tragic
But in this night the red wine rules in me

The dance for fire and wind
And the stories about old kings
Are pleasing our brave lords
Down in the village of dwarves

And time has come now to ride
Before the end of the night
The march of the swordmaster
To the unholy fight

And time has come now to ride
Before the end of the night
The march of the swordmaster
To the unholy fight

Unholy fight
Unholy fight

5. Erian's Mystical Rhymes
In Primordial times of sorrow
Ancient ages of the known world
Kron's reign of terror was rising
So the skylords sent their angels
Against the storm that threatened heavens
Seven wars were so fought
The dead rose
Led by the darklords of hell
The last war
Meant the end
Of hellgod's
Old reign

Dark memories lost in the shades of illusion
Warn the light of electric sky
The angels could change the life on earth
But not the demons' old plans

United force of stron wise men...
A new order soon was born
Ten kings, ten wizards, elves and dragonlords
Ready to fight for their world

Ready to face the last secret
Hidden for 5000 angels' years
5000 years

A great and new hope in Elgard was born
The one hope that could finally find the

Sacred words to stop the dark plan of Nekron
All contained in Erian's mystical white book

The holy council cast their vote
Hearing the deep voice of soul
Etherus... Iras... two names on all
Elected to face the darklord

They knew so well Erian's tale
What could be found between his rhymes
His rhymes of divine light
Written to save our lands

Ready to face the last secret
Hidden for 5000 angels' years
5000 years

Now is the time for them to share all their plans
The one hope that could finally find the

Sacred words to stop the dark plan of Nekron
All contained in Erian's mystical white book

So the name was chosen
White Dragon's Order
All sworn to fight
All for one
One for all

A great and new hope in Elgard was born
The one hope that could finally find the

Sacred words to stop the dark plan of Nekron
All contained in Erian's mystical white book
Sacred words to stop the dark plan of Nekron
All contained in Erian's mystical white book

6. Dawn Of Victory
Fire is raging on the battlefield
While Arwald is fighting the war of the kings
The army of Dargor, the thunder, the storm...
So people are calling the brave and his sword
No time left to save the wise throne!

Shades of a past not so far to forget...
The rise of the demons from their bloody Hell!
So come mighty warrior to light the lost hope
For Tharos the dragon and your cosmic soul...
Now handle your emerald sword!

For Ancelot
The ancient cross of war
For the holy town of gods
Gloria, gloria perpetua
In this dawn of victory

The ride of the dead and their practice of pain
Is pounding in him as a terrific quake
You're closer and closer now follow their smell
With your holy armour the steel in your hand
Fly angel of bloody revenge!

For Ancelot
The ancient cross of war
For the holy town of gods
Gloria, gloria perpetua
In this dawn of victory

Tragic and furious the clash of the steel of the gods
And so magic the power, the sword in his valorous hands
Oceans of fire are blasting the throne of the demons
And from distant red skies the thunders are calling his name
The name of the master of pain!

For Ancelot
The ancient cross of war
For the holy town of gods
Gloria, gloria perpetua
In this dawn of victory
Gloria, gloria perpetua
In this dawn of victory

7. Lamento Eroico
Langue in me l'eco infranto
al truce sguardo dell'angelo cieco
rovina in me l'antica rima
nel cuor del cigno ferito e morente...

Cosmi di eternita' tradita
di verita' svanite che ora versano
lacrime d'addio in un vuoto nero...
sincero e fiero al mio destino andro'...

Urla il tuono
al mio Lamento Eroico
sorte... consuma la realta'!

Spiriti di mondi arcani
chiedo la vita al di la' della morte
per allinear le stelle amiche
e diventar guardiano celeste

Custode di eternita' guarita
di verita' trovate per tutti i figli di madre terra...
sempre a lei ho dato la vita... la morte...
cosi' continuero'!

Urla il tuono
al mio Lamento Eroico
sorte... consuma la realta'!

8. Nightfall On The Grey Mountains
Holy angels of eternal light
You who fell in the primordial age
Between these dark and grey lonely mountains
Who died to protect the green of the earth

For Algalord and Elgard, Thorald and Elnor
For all the towns of the known world
For the icy northlands, the waterfalls' kingdom
The dwarves' western realms and the whole middle lands

Cold mystic night - it falls on the plane
On the grey mountains reigns now the shade
Angels of light give them the faith
Time now has come
Dar-Kunor awaits

Unknown threat - it fills the dry air
The howling of wolves fades behind them
They try to find rest between the wild rocks
The one they'll soon see can be their last dawn

The angels' lament breaths in the cold winds
Whispers of death surround the wide marsh
Dar-Kunor is there to swallow their souls
In front of them another hell's gate

Cold mystic night - it falls on the plane
On the grey mountains reigns now the shade
Angels of light give them the faith
Time now has come
Dar-Kunor awaits

9. March Of The Swordmaster
Ride... die... sacrifice!

Along the river of bloody tears
The mighty steel shining in my hands
We march and honor our brothers
Victims of Kron's evil plan

We cross the lakes of the holy woods
To reach the ocean where red waves rule
The black king is moving to Algalord
This is the time... he has to be stopped!

Hail, Hail!
...Brave Swordmaster!
March, March!
...Great Swordmaster!
And I ask the wind for the fall of the king...!

Into the ray of the sun
March our hero hunting the darklord
Reborn from the blood of his God...
His God... the warmaster Kron
Ride for the fall of his power
Fighting the storm, the roar of the thunder
Ally of the sun and the moon...
Great swordmaster rule!

Between the waves of the raging sea
Echoes of warcries and battle hymns
The underworld's armies found their ancient queen
The funeral march in the depths of the abyss

The terror which strikes, the honor which prays
Will be face to face in the mortal doomsday
Resist my fierce soldiers their vision can kill
It will test your courage... and your will to live

Hail, Hail!
...Brave Swordmaster!
March, March!
...Great Swordmaster!
And I ask the wind for the fall of the king...!

Into the ray of the sun
March our hero hunting the darklord
Reborn from the blood of his God...
His God... the warmaster Kron
Ride for the fall of his power
Fighting the storm, the roar of the thunder
Ally of the sun and the moon...
Great swordmaster rule!

Into the ray of the sun
March our hero hunting the darklord
Reborn from the blood of his God...

Great swordmaster rule!

To avenge all those cries I will rise to the sky
To defend mother life...
Ride... die... sacrifice!

10. Emerald Sword
I crossed the valleys the dust of midlands
To search for the third key to open the gates
Now I'm near the altar the secret inside
As legend told my beloved sun light the dragons eyes
On the way to the glory I'll honour my sword
To serve right ideals and justice for all

Finally happened the sun lit their eyes
The spell was creating strange games of light
Thanks to hidden mirrors I found my lost way
Over the stones I reached the place it was a secret cave
In a long bloody battle that prophecies told
The light will prevail hence wisdom is gold

For the king for the land for the mountains
For the green valleys where dragons fly
For the glory the power to win the black lord
I will search for the emerald sword

Only a warrior with a clear heart
Could have the honour to be kissed by the sun
Yes, I'm that warrior I followed my way
Led by the force of cosmic soul I can reach the sword
On the way to the glory I'll honour my sword
To serve right ideals and justice for all

For the king for the land for the mountains
For the green valleys where dragons fly
For the glory the power to win the black lord
I will search for the emerald sword

down in the crypts of the damned
Her sins will not be the last
when the rituals start

BLACK CANDELS BURNING ANNOUNCE HER COME
BACK / THE REIGN IS AWAITING THE QUEEN OF THE
DEAD... OF  THE DEAD!

Yes, my dear friends, the sun shining on our beloved
lands seems to not be the same anymore... / from
when the magic sword was handled by the black king
Akron none of us... none of us can sleep peacefully...
he's clearly preparing his plans of war to attack the
people of these wonderful valleys... / the ancient
towns of Elnor and Thorald will be surely the first goals
in his ambitious and cruel dream of conquest...
Come mighty warrior... come to help your... your...

Oh god!...oh god... no... / They found it, they found
it... the ancient words are going to be pronounced...
thanks to the cosmic power of the emerald weapon
the book of the dead kept by the dark angel is now
open and the rites of blood are going to begin...
Oh no, god!... oh no... I hear those damned words...
Necros, Dagma, Atra, Krona... / I hear them... Necros,
Dagma, Atra, Krona
Necros, Dagma, Atra, Krona... / I hear them... Necros,
Dagma, Atra, Krona...

The abyss will soon spit out thousands of demoniac
creatures and she will be back to lead them all...!
Why? Why? The godforsaken bitch ancient servant of
Kron will be free from the spell that was trapping her
in the crypts of the ghostland... what the fathers of
my father were able to do is going to end... / Oh yes,
I knew it... I knew it! / ...the power of the emerald
sword in the wrong hands can lead to these tragic results...
I knew it! / ...the waves of the oceans will soon
become giants attacking our towns... and if we
don't organize / a valid controffensive to stop those
creatures this will only be a tragic... / a tragic prelude
to an announced... massacre!

your future... Elnor, Thorald... resist... resist!

[INSTRUMENTAL]

6. The Poem's Evil Page
The silent willows keep the ancient stone

hidden behind that cryptic door

Rituals of terror quake all the ghostland
the bloody line now paints the cold floor
The evil pages are almost written
with the dark poison of flesh and bones
Fire is raining on the grey mountains
Waters are waiting for the last oath
The way is open... now they are coming
called by the blasphemous words of the lord

...and finally the violet waves announce their arrival
and blood will soon be painting the beloved lamenting
ocean...

The way is open... now they are coming
called by the words... the words of the lord

Ethereal harmonies spread trough all the air...
the unreal calm before Elnor's end...

7. The Wizard's Last Rhymes
The aim of the serpent, the serpent's creation
reveals itself now trough crystal spheres
He's riding the waves as a real conqueror
colliding with ships, the ships of the kings
He owns... your sword!

The emerald weapon, the steel of the heroes
Flow the black tears of dark angels
Your blade is now serving the dark force...
the evil source of the unborn
the truth is there... in this hands

QUANDO CORPUS MORIETUR FAC UT ANIMAE
DONETUR / Starless is my night, silent is my ride
trough the paradox of wishdom... to the sea of souls
Nel silenzio tragiche realta'...

FIRE IS BLAZING FAST ACROSS THE BLOODY RED SEA
THE SUNLIGHT IS FADING ON HIM / THESE ARE THE
WIZARD'S LAST HOLY SIGHTS... / THE WIZARD'S LAST
RHYMES

We are reaching the brutal, the tragic dimension
led by reflections, reflections of death
the ghost in the fog... wander lamenting
while violence devours my wasted brain
Let me... awake!

The astral bewitchment is the fatal witness
of created surge of chaos
I reflect the constellations' fall
Now close your eyes and fight blind
The moon is dying, don't fear his might

QUANDO CORPUS MORIETUR FAC UT ANIMAE
DONETUR / Starless is my night, silent is my ride
trough the paradox of wishdom... to the sea of souls
Nel silenzio tragiche realta'...

FIRE IS BLAZING FAST ACROSS THE BLOODY RED SEA

WIZARD'S LAST HOLY SIGHTS... / THE POEM'S TRAGIC
RHYMES

Fierce blows the wind, infinite fires
on Elnor sea... hail to the king!
He died as brave, oh valiant hero
but so in vain, facing the storm... the storm!

And soon the snakes of the abyss
swallowed the mighty woodship
while the waves of the bloody ocean
were reaching the walls of the falling town...

QUANDO CORPUS MORIETUR FAC UT ANIMAE
DONETUR / Starless is my night, silent is my ride

2. Rage Of The Winter (Symphonic Version)
Cold is the winter snow falls down
mystical lights dance in the sky to the winds of night
Spell of the nature fill all my soul
kiss with your wonderful song my land with love
 
Rage of the winter mould the horizon
cover the mountains forest and lakes
Rage of the winter magical wonder
enchanted fury majestic force
 
There are no words to describe the poetry of landscape
I can receive all the magic that my season gives
Tears of the winter falling on me freezing my dark side
my heart must be wide fair full light eyes

3. Forest Of Unicorns
Run holy beloved horse
on this peaceful day
through these valleys kissed by light
where peace is so rare
 
So hardy trees let me hear your words
about those memories
please tell me all about our hold
and epic battles they won
 
Beware of unholy fire
my guardian of the trees
their flames can't burn the memory
the wisdom of the kings
The secret of this forest
the ride of unicorns
are treasures of these valleys
where freedom has its throne
where love must reign eternally
avoiding acts of war
 
We must have all their valour
to defend these lands
or the sun in these valleys
will not shine again
 
Beware of unholy fire
my guardian of the trees
their flames can't burn the memory
the wisdom of the kings
The secret of this forest
the ride of unicorns
are treasures of these valleys
where freedom has its throne
where love must reign eternally
avoiding acts of war

4. Land Of Immortals (Remix)
Hear the silence of the winds making your own destiny
go and face the mirror of their sin
Only brave hearts found the way breaking all the dragon's spell
cross the Argon's glade with heart in hand
 
Land of immortals I wait for my day
to reach the wisdom of your skies
Land of immortals you must belong to me
from here to eternity
 
And between Elgard's hills near the ancient ruins of Kron
you will face the trick of the old dwarf
To obtain the second key you have to cross the bloody sea
where the thirst of Tharos never ends
 
Land of immortals I wait for my day
to reach the wisdom of your skies
Land of immortals you must belong to me
from here to eternity
 
Holy force of wisdom spread through all the air
I shall breathe you forever to end this epic holy quest
My way will be hard but I would do all
to reach the valleys where true heroes ride beyond the ivory gates
 
Land of immortals I wait for my day
to reach the wisdom of your skies
Land of immortals you must belong to me
from here to eternity

5. Emerald Sword
I crossed the valleys the dust of midlands
to search for the third key to open the gates
Now I'm near the altar the secret inside
As legend told my beloved sun light the dragons eyes
On the way to the glory I'll honour my sword
to serve right ideals and justice for all
 
Finally happened the sun lit their eyes
the spell was creating strange games of light
Thanks to hidden mirrors I found my lost way
over the stones I reached the place it was a secret cave
In a long bloody battle that prophecies told
the light will prevail hence wisdom is gold
 
For the king for the land for the mountains
for the green valleys where dragons fly
for the glory the power to win the black lord
I will search for the emerald sword
 
Only a warrior with a clear heart
could have the honour to be kissed by the sun
Yes, I'm that warrior I followed my way
led by the force of cosmic soul I can reach the sword
On the way to the glory I'll honour my sword
to serve right ideals and justice for all
 
For the king for the land for the mountains
for the green valleys where dragons fly
for the glory the power to win the black lord
I will search for the emerald sword

6. Wisdom Of The Kings
Removed the stones which hide the cave
blind and dark along my way
I must go on wise and brave before a last hail
At the end of floor stairs of ancient stone
lead me to a vision, an unreal hall
 
And they appear in front of me
lightened by a mystic flame
A new dimension I have to face beyond the gates
I can not believe on what now I see
when the two demons awake from the sleep
 
Holy dragons keepers of time
ride brave the blue skies and spell my eyes
fly beyond these hills ride on the wind
the wisdom of the kings
 
Lost in a dream I'm under the spell
of the sunny magic land
But Aresius said: become aware! all can hide the hell...
Now it's time to go to the mighty sword
it's time to follow the kings holy call
 
Holy dragons keepers of time
ride brave the blue skies and spell my eyes
fly beyond these hills ride on the wind
the wisdom of the kings

7. Wings Of Destiny
Day has gone but I'm still here with you
my sweet rose my green hills
beloved sea, lakes and sky
beloved mother earth
 
Silent land erase my thoughts
I wanna lose myself in you, all in you
caress me and my soul while I close my eyes
 
On wings of destiny
through virgin skies
to far horizons I will fly
 
Dear peaceful land, dear mother earth
caress my soul while I close my eyes
 
On wings of destiny
through virgin skies
to far horizons I will fly

8. Riding The Winds Of Eternity
Wise and mighty you are force of the earth
Fierce becomes the sea at your command
Winds of the south winds of the north
let me hear your call
Blow on my heart filling my soul
give me the force of the storm
 
For all of the time I will ride be my guide
I will follow your sign for a just life
Winds of the south winds of the north
let me hear your call
Blow on my heart filling my soul
give me the force of the storm
 
Riding the holy winds, winds of eternity
I'll fight you forever nightmares sons

9. Dawn Of Victory
Fire is raging on the battlefield
while Arwald is fighting the war of the kings
The army of Dargor, the thunder, the storm...
so people are calling the brave and his sword
No time left to save the wise throne!
 
Shades of a past not so far to forget...
the rise of the demons from their bloody Hell!
So come mighty warrior to light the lost hope
for Tharos the dragon and your cosmic soul...
Now handle your emerald sword!
 
For Ancelot
the ancient cross of war
for the holy town of gods
Gloria, gloria perpetua
in this dawn of victory
 
The ride of the dead and their practice of pain
is pounding in him as a terrific quake
You're closer and closer now follow their smell
with your holy armour the steel in your hand
Fly angel of bloody revenge!
 
For Ancelot
the ancient cross of war
for the holy town of gods
Gloria, gloria perpetua
in this dawn of victory
 
Tragic and furious the clash of the steel of the gods
and so magic the power, the sword in his valorous hands
Oceans of fire are blasting the throne of the demons
and from distant red skies the thunders are calling his name
the name of the master of pain!
 
For Ancelot
the ancient cross of war
for the holy town of gods
Gloria, gloria perpetua
in this dawn of victory

10. Holy Thunderforce (Remix)
Face me evil bastards, smell the hate of angels
Glory, pride and bloodshed
Cowards and beholders, rapers of my wisdom
mix of dust and bones
Go back to your abyss, Algalord will not fall
but your heads will soon roll
Test the blade of heroes, fury of the thunder
hit my golden shield
 
So we'll fight against the wind for the glory of the kings
to defeat the evil enemies
And we'll ride with our lord for the power and the throne
in the name of holy thunderforce
 
Arwald and Aresius with the nordic warrior
on their way to Hargor
Chaos and oblivion, turmoil and disorder
will have now their name
The last fallen heroes will defeat your forces
Thousands spirits calling
On the furthest mountain I will see your fire
quenched by holy frost!
 
So we'll fight against the wind for the glory of the kings
to defeat the evil enemies
And we'll ride with our lord for the power and the throne
in the name of holy thunderforce
 
Face me evil bastards, smell the hate of angels
Glory, pride and bloodshed
Cowards and beholders, rapers of my wisdom
mix of dust and bones
Go back to your abyss, Algalord will not fall
but your heads will soon roll
Test the blade of heroes, fury of the thunder
hit my golden shield
 
So we'll fight against the wind for the glory of the kings
to defeat the evil enemies
And we'll ride with our lord for the power and the throne
in the name of holy thunderforce
 
So we'll fight against the wind for the glory of the kings
to defeat the evil enemies
And we'll ride with our lord for the power and the throne
in the name of holy thunderforce
 
So we'll fight against the wind for the glory of the kings
to defeat the evil enemies
And we'll ride with our lord for the power and the throne
in the name of holy thunderforce

11. The Village Of Dwarves
The dwarves of Lork are showing all their honour
when you walk on the Gandor secret hill
 
The dance for fire and wind
and the stories about old kings
are pleasing our brave lords
down in the village of dwarves
 
The elves are playing under timeless willows
while blue and red paint all my beloved land
 
The dance for fire and wind
and the stories about old kings
are pleasing our brave lords
down in the village of dwarves
 
The eagle's eye is hiding something tragic
but in this night the red wine rules in me
 
The dance for fire and wind
and the stories about old kings
are pleasing our brave lords
down in the village of dwarves
 
And all night long me Arwald and Aresius
we speak, we laugh, we honor our king
 
The dance for fire and wind
and the stories about old kings
are pleasing our brave lords
down in the village of dwarves
 
The eagle's eye is hiding something tragic
but in this night the red wine rules in me
 
The dance for fire and wind
and the stories about old kings
are pleasing our brave lords
down in the village of dwarves
 
And time has come now to ride
before the end of the night
the march of the swordmaster
to the unholy fight
 
And time has come now to ride
before the end of the night
the march of the swordmaster
to the unholy fight
Unholy fight
Unholy fight

12. Rain Of A Thousand Flames
DIES IRAE
REGNA NELL' OSCURITA'
 
Guardians of the moonlight bring the spell alive
trought the sphere of sorrow lead my holy ride
Titans of the desert face the warlord's pride
fighters from the near lakes join the tragic night
 
War of the ghostland take your souls
but give us freedom once and for all
...firestorm!
 
UNDER THE RAIN OF A THOUSAND FLAMES
WE FACE THE REAL PAIN FALLING IN VAIN
WHILE THE DARK ANGEL SCREAMS FOR VENGEANCE
IN THE DEAD SHADOW OF FALLING STARS
 
Silent cries of virgins touch the heart of night
raped by the demons under painful sights
Sperm and blood and terror chaos in my head
Is the law of evil triumph for the damned
 
War of the ghostland take your souls
but give us freedom once and for all
...firestorm!
 
UNDER THE RAIN OF A THOUSAND FLAMES
WE FACE THE REAL PAIN FALLING IN VAIN
WHILE THE DARK ANGEL SCREAMS FOR VENGEANCE
IN THE DEAD SHADOW OF FALLING STARS
 
...Moonlight is the witness of the most tragic day for our lands...
nothing seems possible to change the destiny of war...
Lament of heroes reach the deep skies
fill the wide cosmos and free my pain... my pain!
 
UNDER THE RAIN OF A THOUSAND FLAMES

WHILE THE DARK ANGEL SCREAMS FOR VENGEANCE
IN THE DEAD SHADOW

13. Knightrider Of Doom
The fading illusion the sirens' grey tears
it's here in the cold air the town's tragic fear
The breath of infernos the rise of the dead
the portals of chaos the seventh black flame
 
(RIDE) Destino (KNIGHT) mi arrendo
...al tuo dominio del tempo!
 
IN THIS BLOODY DAWN
I WILL WASH MY SOUL
TO CALL THE SPIRIT OF VENGEANCE
TO DENY MY WISDOM FOR ANGER
TO BREAK THE SCREAM OF THE SILENT FOOL
AND TO BE THE SON OF DOOM...
IN THIS BLOOD DAWN
I WILL WASH MY SOUL
TO CALL THE SPIRIT OF VENGEANCE
TO DENY MY WISDOM FOR ANGER
TO BREAK THE SCREAM OF THE SILENT FOOL
TO BE A KNIGHTRIDER OF DOOM...
 
The rites of the unborn the dragonship's fall
the waves of my ocean the twins' holy call
The march of the heroes the call of the gods
after the rituals on the silent shore
 
(RIDE) Destino (KNIGHT) mi arrendo
...al tuo dominio del tempo!
 
IN THIS BLOODY DAWN
I WILL WASH MY SOUL
TO CALL THE SPIRIT OF VENGEANCE

14. March Of The Swordmaster
Ride... die... sacrifice!
 
Along the river of bloody tears
the mighty steel shining in my hands
we march and honor our brothers
victims of Kron's evil plan
 
We cross the lakes of the holy woods
to reach the ocean where red waves rule
the black king is moving to Algalord
this is the time... he has to be stopped!
 
HAIL, HAIL!
...Brave Swordmaster!
MARCH, MARCH!
...Great Swordmaster!
and I ask the wind for the fall of the king...!

REBORN FROM THE BLOOD OF HIS GOD...
HIS GOD... THE WARMASTER KRON
RIDE FOR THE FALL OF HIS POWER
FIGHTING THE STORM, THE ROAR OF THE THUNDER
ALLY OF THE SUN AND THE MOON...
GREAT SWORDMASTER RULE!
 
Between the waves of the raging sea
echoes of warcries and battle hymns
the underworld's armies found their ancient queen
the funeral march in the depths of the abyss
 
The terror which strikes the honor which prays
will be face to face in the mortal doomsday
Resist my fierce soldiers their vision can kill
it will test your courage... and your will to live
 
HAIL, HAIL!
...Brave Swordmaster!
MARCH, MARCH!
...Great Swordmaster!
and I ask the wind for the fall of the king...!

15. Power Of The Dragonflame
Rise mighty dragon...
Rise, rise, rise, rise...
Mighty dragon rise!
 
Ruins of ancient wisdom closing now my darkest lonely eye
god is dead in Thorald and in Elnor's rhyme
Mutilated bodies are now carved in ancient holy stone
tragic decoration of unholy wars
 
The heart of the dragon is screaming awaiting
to write the black last page
The page of blood was written by them...
the dead now lying on the sand
 
Visions of disaster are now challenging the
wild storms
cyclops of the midlands wash my bloody shore
Sirens from the open seas now heal my broken wounded brain
I call the holy typhoons... air, fire, earth!
 
The heart of the dragon is screaming awaiting
to write the black last page
The poem of blood was written by them...
the dead now lying on the sand
 
FROM THE SILENT HILL WE SCREAM LOUD YOUR NAME
MIGHTY POWER OF THE DRAGONFLAME
FROM THE MOUNTAINS PROUD AND STRONG
WE CALL OUR DRAGONLORD
 
Mighty dragon rise... rise!
 
Energie di cosmi estinti gridano sangue
dalle terre dell'ignoto senza pieta'
 
The heart of the dragon is screaming awaiting
to write the black last page
The poem of blood was written by them...
the dead now on the sand
 
FROM THE SILENT HILL WE SCREAM LOUD YOUR NAME
MIGHTY POWER OF THE DRAGONFLAME
FROM THE MOUNTAINS PROUD AND STRONG
WE CALL OUR DRAGONLORD

1. Unholy Warcry
"It was a good time for 
all creatures of the earth, 
but fate decreed that the dark 
prophecy of a demonknight 
could bring a tragic end to this peace 
scarring their lives forever!

Darklands surrounding Hargor 
and venture forth deep into 
the caves of Dark-Kunor. 
His is a name the world will never forget,
he is Dargor."

[Dargor:] Father
are you really wanting my soul?
your black blood
no longer flows in my veins
[Vankar:] son you are a betrayer
You have betrayed me!!
[Dargor:] No! I don't want to serve
you hellish will
[Vankar:] You are half demon 
never forget that! You are one of us!
[Dargor:] I know it well for this I will pay!
But I will deny you and fight you forever!

Sacred power of raging winds
fill their soul
and the shadowlord's heart
in a magical vision Vankar appeared
in Dargor's dream
while the four heroes
where trying to rest
he was born half demon half man
he struggled inside
but would soon understand
all would be pay with the
blood on his hands

GODS LEAD THEM ALL
TO HARGOR'S WALLS
SACRED POWER OF RAGING WINDS
KEEP AWAY FROM THE BLACK ORDER'S STEEL
(THEIR BLACK STEEL THEIR BLACK WILL)
SACRED POWER OF RAGING WINDS
PLEASE HELP THEM REACH THEIR GOAL
TO HIDE IN THE SNOW
DARGOR'S PAST APPEARS BEFORE HIM
VANKAR'S THIRST FOR BLOODY VENGEANCE
VANKAR LIVES FOR VENGEANCE

From whom the Gods destroy they first make mad
casting shadows on our fears
Malicious designs built strong and iron-clad catostrophic
conclusion, judgement closes near

Chaos sets the stage
bitter mouths of violent rage
spinning webs of timeless confusion
help us find our way

Tonight can we scape from this hell
(seasons ragin - sands of time will fall)
conquer the wicked
tonight can we escape from ourselves

Ten-thousand tyrants preach their treachery
striking down the weary and the wise
Swords of oppression sever the artery
of our freedom - victimized

Chaos sets the stage
bitter mouths of violent rage
spinning webs of timeless confusion
help us find our way

Tonight can we scape from this hell
(seasons ragin - sands of time will fall)
conquer the wicked
tonight can we escape from ourselves

Down-cast jaded - the glory has faded
so close your eyes
(locked in the darkness all your life...)
dream a twisted tale - dark and venomous
(...do you really have a reason not to fell this raging season)
so infamous

Watch the raging inferno of serpents rip the flesh
from all your pride and glory
then you die open your eyes - it's true

[Solo]

Chaos sets the stage
bitter mouths of violent rage
spinning webs of timeless confusion
help us find our way

Tonight can we scape from this hell
(seasons ragin - sands of time will fall)
conquer the wicked
tonight can we escape from ourselves

3. Premonition
[Music: Michael Romeo, Michael Pinnela, Thomas Miller, Jason Rullo and Rod Tyler]

Unlock the doors of silence
scanning eyes turn into stone
pours the wine of hate and enmity

Helpless minds dance in circles
forever frozen within time
then stare into unlit serenity

Endless dreams are all encased in disarray

Through the eyes of time - I see
all the love and tragedy
the breath of fate surrounds me
and bring me to my kness

Through the eyes of time - I see
peace and false tranquility
although my scars - they do
run deep - right here I'll be

Blind visions summond me
return under blackened skies
scorned and scathed by the spirit's song

A shadow forbears warning
reveals a rhyme, then descends
and falls into the black endless sea

Endless dreams are all encased in disarray

Through the eyes of time - I see
all the love and tragedy
the breath of fate surrounds me
and bring me to my kness

Through the eyes of time - I see
peace and false tranquility
although my scars - they do
run deep - right here I'll be

Our inner strenghts will fill our needs
and heal the hearts that still bleed

[Solo]

Our inner strenghts will fill our needs
and heal the hearts that still bleed

4. Masquerade
[Music: Michael Romeo, Michael Pinnela, Thomas Miller, Jason Rullo and Rod Tyler]

Shackled in darkness - the forbidden portrait confined to
it's frame
Unbroken silence - a total misfortune and shame

Ragin obsession - this mask of oppression, it hides your
agression from view
This tearing suture renounces the love he once knew

Your sacrifice this paradise of innocence
Trust the lie - you falsify the line of truth
You disguise your insolence
Don't deny insanity - mediocrity

Save us from this masquerade of lies
Kings and fools die in ridicule (save us)
Save us from this masquerade of lies

A fallen fortress sees him beneath starless skies
Subsiding deeper - the final farewell in his eyes

Unspoken hero - distrusted and thrusted within surmise
Seizing intrusion to unveil his clever disguise

Your sacrifice this paradise of innocence
Trust the lie - you falsify the line of truth

Save us from this masquerade of lies
Kings and fools die in ridicule (save us)
Save us from this masquerade of lies

[Solo]

Save us from this masquerade of lies
Kings and fools die in ridicule (save us)
Save us from this masquerade of lies

5. Absinthe And Rue
[Music: Michael Romeo, Michael Pinnela, Thomas Miller, Jason Rullo and Rod Tyler]

In your time of dying don't call my name
so you see me as evil it's just the same

Through the windows in my mind
now you're cast in flames

Absinthe and Rue
twisted wings of paranoia
twilight runs through eyes of ignorance

Afflicted, addicted, and wicked
you'll loom in fear
severed, endeavored in trial
time closes near

Obsessing, possessing, confessing consumed by sin
injected, infected by venom that's searing your skin

Through the windows in my mind
now you're cast in flames

Absinthe and Rue
twisted wings of paranoia
twilight runs through eyes of ignorance

Absinthe and Rue
twisted wings of paranoia
twilight runs through eyes of ignorance

[Solo]

Absinthe and Rue
twisted wings of paranoia
twilight runs through eyes of ignorance

Absinthe and Rue
twisted wings of paranoia
twilight runs through eyes of ignorance

6. Shades Of Grey
[Music: Michael Romeo, Michael Pinnela, Thomas Miller, Jason Rullo and Rod Tyler]

Seasons changing now - summer's come
and I'll be on my own
just bear another day

I have wondered - if I can turn back hands of time
I'll try, just try another way

I don't know why my heart keeps calling,
but I really don't want you to stay
I have my reasons to keep from falling
then cast me into shades of gray

Life's an endless stage - wisdom comes with age,
can't you see what mindless games we play

(So the end)
So the end is near - captured by the spirit in the wind
you keep calling out to me

I'll find my way
I'll wee it through

I don't know why my heart keeps calling,
but I really don't want you to stay
I have my reasons to keep from falling
then cast me into shades of gray

[Solo]

When the curtain falls - I'll hold my head up high
and curse you all
such vicious games we play

I don't know why my heart keeps calling,
but I really don't want you to stay
I have my reasons to keep from falling
then cast me into shades of gray

I don't know why my heart keeps calling,
but I really don't want you to stay
I have my reasons to keep from falling
then cast me into shades of gray

7. Taunting The Notorious
[Music: Michael Romeo, Michael Pinnela, Thomas Miller, Jason Rullo and Rod Tyler]

Don't give me reasons
why you spread your disease like aplague

Caught up in treason
a faith that's misleading and vague

It's so sad our world is breaking down
feeling desires, desires are set in my mind

Your corrupted ways
my sarcastic daze
Parasites infecting us
savage and notorious

Lost in the kingdom
kingdom of pain and my spite
whirlwind of power
power controllng my mind

It's so sad our world is breaking down
feeling desires, desires are set in my mind

Your corrupted ways
my sarcastic daze
Parasites infecting us
savage and notorious

[Solo]

Your corrupted ways
my sarcastic daze
Parasites infecting us
savage and notorious

Your corrupted ways
my sarcastic daze
Parasites infecting us
savage and notorious

8. Rapture Or Pain
[Music: Michael Romeo, Michael Pinnela, Thomas Miller, Jason Rullo and Rod Tyler]

A tearless stare
encased by fear
like a thread my heart is torn
and ripped right from my soul
with no control

Suits in disguise then fades to red
brings a blackened sky to fall
and make you very cold
while you grow old

Gone whithout a trace (gone)
it's left me chained and bound
my heart you thrust a dagger
my life and dreams are shattered
and left in tyranny

Rapture or pain
you spill my blood and take my life away
rapture or pain
all adversions still remain

You've realized
you're not alone
they've took your breath of life
and left your mind to unfold
lifeless and cold

Your thoughts erased
it's death you taste
your searing face
it hides the scars of love

Gone whithout a trace (gone)
it's left me chained and bound
my heart you thrust a dagger
my life and dreams are shattered
and left in tyranny

Rapture or pain
you spill my blood and take my life away
rapture or pain
all adversions still remain

Rapture or pain
you spill my blood and take my life away
rapture or pain
all adversions still remain

9. Thorns Of Sorrow
[Music: Michael Romeo, Michael Pinnela, Thomas Miller, Jason Rullo and Rod Tyler]

Beckoning me through aeons of time - captured by you
in dismay
I try to elude these prisions of flesh - but return to
shattered domains

There's no image in the mirror
Shattered glass impales my soul

She's like thorns of sorrow - ripping through my head
She's like thorns of sorrow - visions turning red

Enchanting me - defying my love - I'm hindered with
penance and pain

False reflection of grandeur and light - leaves my heart
bleeding and stained

There's no image in the mirror
Shattered glass impales my soul

She's like thorns of sorrow - ripping through my head
She's like thorns of sorrow - visions turning red

[solo]

She's like thorns of sorrow - ripping through my head
She's like thorns of sorrow - visions turning red

She's like thorns of sorrow - ripping through my head
She's like thorns of sorrow - visions turning red

10. A Lesson Before Dying
[Music: Michael Romeo, Michael Pinnela, Thomas Miller, Jason Rullo and Rod Tyler]

A chill grows near you're faced with fear
a darkened day you'll see it clear

your shadows call while you stand tall
watch before me while you fall

Times are changing, rearranging
where's the answer we've all been looking for
transient dreaming do you believe in
I am the answer to it all

where are you heading to time will tell
to a destiny that fate knows well
so fly away

Victim of the silence - wipe the cob - webs from your eyes
beware the season - the lies, the treason, the pain

You're running in reverse now - while struggling to break
free
the path you strayed from can only lead to dismay

Living a timeless tale
Behold the truth unveiled
Passion and glory fill my heart
Knowing my fate

Nightmare of fantasy
Untrue reality
Learning the lesson
as we fight to stay alive

Awakened by the thunder - crashing conscience
through your mind
persistent voices - all evils call out your name

Tears can break the silence - let your doubts
and fears be heard
You're releasing inned peace from your soul

Marching on staff in hand
falling into darkness
carry on through the endless nights calling

Living a timeless tale
Behold the truth unveiled
Passion and glory fill my heart
Knowing my fate

Nightmare of fantasy
Untrue reality
Learning the lesson
as we fight to stay alive

Crying downs your doubts and fears
they say that time just might heal the wounds of love

it replaces shattered traces of dispair
looking out through all the years
they say that time just might heal the wounds of love
it replaces

Love will light the darkness there
bringing some hope into view
it replaces the nameless faces of loneliness that you once
knew

Marching on staff in hand
falling into darkness
carry on through the endless nights calling

Living a timeless tale
Behold the truth unveiled
Passion and glory fill my heart
Knowing my fate

Nightmare of fantasy
Untrue reality
Learning the lesson
as we fight to stay alive

Passing through the void
The darkest grand illusion
Chaos is riding on the wind

Destroyed in agony
They create a maddened lair
Summon all to heed their cry

Innocence fading away
- the dying eyes of prey

Desperate cries, hail of fire deciding
All our fate in the night
Tempt in sin, shadows then begin to
Gather the souls they hold within

Victims of desire
Pestilence of their invasion
Forms then take on evil waves

Paralyze, victimize
The shadows fall and enter fast
from the sky - (from the sky)
Summon all to heed their cry

Innocence fading away
- the dying eyes of the prey

Desperate cries, hail of fire deciding
All our fate in the night
Tempt in sin, shadows then begin to
Gather the souls they hold within

I've betrayed - slowly fade
I repent my inner plea
I've denied - sanctified
Cannot hide form this
monstrosity

I'm immersed in a curse
Of this jaded imagery
Realize that your cries
Only jeopardize this legacy

[Solo]

Desperate cries, hail of fire deciding
All our fate in the night
Tempt in sin, shadows then begin to
Gather the souls they hold within

2. Sea Of Lies
[Music: Michael Romeo, Michael Pinnella, Thomas Miller]
[Lyrics: Russel Allen]

Today I've seen the shallow face I wear
Inside this shell,
a living hell endures
I'm held captive by my fear,
decaying hope and wasted years
The knife of time carves another
line around these eyes

Good and evil - lust primeval
Dragging me into a sea of lies

Losing faith in who I am
Never changing just rearranging
my life again
Through into an eternal abyss I fall,
Silent screams through paper walls
I pray someday the sun will shine
on me again (shine on me again)

Good and evil - lust primeval
Dragging me into a sea of lies

Lies ... lies ...

[Solo]

Lies ... lies ...

3. Out Of The Ashes
[Music: Michael Romeo, Michael Pinnella, Thomas Miller]
[Lyrics: Russel Allen]

In the house of my master
Behind the gate there is a bed
Oh, I hear laughter
I forged the iron bars that
someday will imprison me

Ooh, mother will you help me
Mother will you help me
To find a reason to go on

Out of the ashes of my youth
- I rise a man
And through the eyes of truth
- I finally understand
The way

I've been beaten with his words
and whipped with his lies
He will not break me down no
matter how hard he tries
Pray for my lost soul
Out of control the storm inside
me rages on and on and on

Mother will you help me
Mother will you help me
To find a reason to go on

Out of the ashes of my youth
- I rise a man
And through the eyes of truth
- I finally understand
The way

[Solo]

Out of the ashes of my youth
- I rise a man
And through the eyes of truth
- I finally understand
The way

4. The Accolade
[Music: Michael Romeo, Michael Pinnela, Thomas Miller]
[Lyrics: Russel Allen]

Into the morning sun
Down his chosen road he rides to
save the world
Cross of crimson, robe of white
Sworn to the quest for the rest of
his life

Play shields and wooden swords
Slaying dragons as a knight of
Arthur's Court
Trained to kill, to sing a song
Youthful hope to right the wrong

Sons of Antioch
An angel's voice cries out to him
Free the holy lands,
bring peace to it again

Across the seas through sands of time
Knight of the Templar
A charging steed through lands unkind
A legend forever

A heart of gold pumps within his metal skin
A noble line he carries on

[Solo]

Braving the bloody din
Silver spurs are justly earned by
strength within
Squire to knight,
like prince to king
Chalice of life completes the ring

Into the morning sun
Down his chosen road he rides to
save the world

Across the seas through sands of time
Knight of the Templar
A charging steed through lands unkind
A legend forever

To see the light he spent his life
to understand
The sword he once held tight,
falls forever from his hands

Across the seas through sands of time
Knight of the Templar
A charging steed through lands unkind
A legend forever

5. Pharaoh
[Music: Symphony X]
[Lyrics: Russel Allen]

Ancient lands, lost in time
Storms of sand, walls of lime
Surround this mask of death I wear

Awakened by intruder souls
The jackal screams as my stone gods behold
Desecraters of Ra

Pharaoh's curse upon you
Who dares to invade his sacred ground
Gods of the Nile arise to strike you down

Forgotten days of my rule, cities
blazed with gold and jewel
Diamond symbol of riches
beyond compare

Now I lay cold in this chamber of
stone
Fools forsaken the wrath of my
throne
Desecraters of Ra

Pharaoh's curse upon you
Who dares to invade his sacred ground
Gods of the Nile arise to strike you down

Mystic gods of the stars
- I summon thee from afar
Sun, moon and earth
- align for my rebirth

I feel the blood flow through my veins
The life force shines on me again
Let the ritual begin
- you will pay for your sins

I am god, I am king of the land
The hour of judgement is at hand
Winds of revenges sweep through the sand
The mighty pharaoh lives again

[Solo]

Pharaoh's curse upon you
Who dares to invade his sacred ground
Gods of the Nile arise to strike you down

6. The Eyes Of Medusa
[Music: Michael Romeo, Michael Pinnela, Thomas Miller]
[Lyrics: Thomas Miller]

Can you look into my eyes
Tell me, now do you somehow
still recognize this stare I wear
Through crystal tears

The light escapes my smile
There is no likeness to be seen,
it is so strange to me

Awaken vindication
The mirrors curse-it besets me

Endless, timeless, faceless terror
To the isle of deadly shores
Sightless, countless, ageless
torture
To behold the sight of Medusa's
eyes

Under a spell - I'm enchanted
The hand of fate is never late to
ring the time
I'm forced to climb the walls

A voice bids last farewell
With no beginning or no end to
be found by me

Endless, timeless, faceless terror
To the isle of deadly shores
Sightless, countless, ageless
torture
To behold the sight of Medusa's
eyes

[Solo]

[Instrumental]
[The Isle of Deadly Shores]

Endless, timeless, faceless terror
To the isle of deadly shores
Sightless, countless, ageless
torture
To behold the sight of Medusa's
eyes

7. The Witching Hour
[Music: Michael Romeo, Michael Pinnela]
[Lyrics: Russel Allen, Michael Romeo]

It was seven score and sixteen more
A dreadful scene to behold
Marble silhouettes, white
statuettes
Forever gaze into time
(Caught in a web between life and
death)

Visions dance throughout the
night
In the pale moon light
In the witching hour

Haunting minuet, immortal duet
Dance to the waltz of the souls
Stillness falls upon the aging hall
The fading chimes echo midnight
(Caught in a web between life and
death, life and death)

Visions dance throughout the
night
In the pale moon light
In the witching hour

8. The Divine Wings Of Tragedy
[All Music: Michael Romeo, Michael Pinnela, Thomas Miller]

[Part I - At the Four Corners of the Earth]
[Lyrics: Romeo, Pinnela]

On the edge of paradise
Tears of woe fall, cold as ice
Hear my cry
Renounce, have you, thy name
Eternal is my pain

Eternal is the pain that leads me
to the thrones of temptation
Eternal is the pain that leads me
to the thrones of temptation ...

[Part II - In the Room of Thrones]

[Instrumental]

[Part III - A Gathering of Angels]
[Lyrics: Michael Romeo]

There was a time ...
When nine choirs sang the
endless melody of light
Music of the spheres
There was a place ...
Where mortals embraced thunder
and majesty
Their fate lay in our hands
Feel my wings slowly fading -
forever lost in time - I cry

[Part IV - The Wrath Divine]
[Lyrics: Michael Romeo, Thomas Miller]

The burning conflict I'm feeling
It summons me to descend into
the other side
And just beyond the stars blazing
A beam light from a red, velvet
moon illuminates me

I will devise, from perfect skies
A dark and vengeful day
Faith and mercy gone astray

With strength of infinite measure
The mighty sword divides order
from chaos in the kingdom below
And from the mansions of glory,
This empty soul cries out one
final plea ...
The end has begun

Our worlds collide, now in
disguise,
You'll feel the Wrath Divine
Tears of woe fall from the sky ...

[Part V - The Prophet's Cry]
[Lyrics: Michael Romeo]

The prophet cries
Vast battalions rage on in the sky
Rising from the north
- the bringer of war
Eve of destruction
Summon all who have 'power
over fire'
Impending doom from shore to
shore

Standing on the edge of paradise
I sacrifice my truth and loyalty
Seven deadly sins consume you
all, a dance with death
I taste the victory

(Eternal is the pain that leads me to temptation)

Rising from the north
- the warrior prince
Judgement without compassion
eyes of fear
Like the river Styx,
the gates of hell -
"Abandon hope all ye who enter here"

The prophets cry
As armies fall from the edge of
the sky
The Prince of truth, now the
bringer of war

The day of wrath
Banish all kings from the face of the land
Dominion for strength is my
name

[Part VI - Bringer of the Apocalypse]

[Instrumental]

Eve of Sacrifice/Armies in the Sky/Dies trae

[Part VII - Paradise Regained]
[Lyrics: Russel Allen, Michael Pinnella]

Looking out on a blue sky
I can see a new world arising
Like a prisoner unbound
I feel the power and the majesty
again

Looking up to the heavens
I can see what I left behind
Beneath the stars, moon and
warm sun
And all I know,
is my paradise has begun ...

9. Candlelight Fantasia
[Music: Michael Romeo, Michael Pinnela]
[Lyrics: Thomas Miller]

Just one more night
One more score
Another question in my mind,
can't take no more

Kissing the tears form my face as
they fall
To the ground in silence
in twilight and faded time
Spirits cold, with no love
Bells ring the lonely chime
Candle fires
These lit dreams can't burn alone

Winds of change bring songs
upon my memory
An empty heart and soul
intoxicates me
This darkened page orchestrates
my final destiny
Not knowing what,
what tomorrow will bring

From within the mirrors eyes
I'm forced to run away and hide
I feel those mystic eyes subside
And leave me blind
Through passages in time
I'm prisoned and locked behind the door
Lonely roses slowly wither and die

I can't escape this captive misery
Heart stone cold, under supremacy
Thrown into a raging sea of tyranny

Life's vile walls have tangled me in webs
Eternally caught in my futures threads
Play the violent strings of my symphony

[Solo]

Transcend the absence of this fantasy
Just another vision
Washed away with the tide
No place for forgotten ones
I cannot deny
What lies beyond, beyond this fantasy

From within the mirrors eyes
I'm forced to run away and hide
I feel those mystic eyes subside
And leave my blind
Through passages in time
A prisoner locked behind the door
Lonely roses slowly wither and die

Shackled in darkness
- the forbidden portrait confined to it's frame
Unbroken silence
- a total misfortune and shame

Raging obsession - this mask of oppression
it hides your aggression from view
This tearing suture renounces
the love he once knew

Your sacrifice this paradise of innocence
Trust the lie - you falsify the line of truth
You disguise your insolence
Don't deny insanity - mediocrity

Save us from this masquerade of lies
Kings and fools die in ridicule (save us)
Save us from this masquerade of lies

A fallen fortress sees him beneath starless skies
Subsiding deeper - the final farewell in his eyes

Unspoken hero
- distrusted and trusted within surmise
Seizing intrusion to unveil his clever disguise

Your sacrifice this paradise of innocence
Trust the lie - you falsify the line of truth

Save us from this masquerade of lies
Kings and fools die in ridicule (save us)
Save us from this masquerade of lies

[solo]

Save us from this masquerade of lies
Kings and fools die in ridicule (save us)
Save us from this masquerade of lies

2. A Winter's Dream - Prelude (Part I)
[Music: Romeo, Pinnela, Miller, Rullo and Allen]

Although your words are empty,
I can hear now, what you feel inside

The night is drawing closer,
you fell you have to hide.

Your fears are never wrong or right
Everything is either black or white.

It's time to close your eyes now,
begin your fantasy - what does it mean?
Wake your dreams (commence now...)
into reality.

Your fears are never wrong or right
Everything is either black or white.

In a Winter's Dream - I'll be there for you
In a Winter's Dream - I'll be there for you

3. The Damnation Game
[Music: Romeo, Pinnela, Miller, Rullo and Allen]

Forever cursed by this game, he who plays with sin
Incantations summoned up our creations

We're players cast in this tale, believe it
stranger than fiction
This justice thunders our condemnation

Falling into innocence by a shadow's kiss
He speaks what mortals dare to say, will he betray?

If you dare play the game - your descent preordained
from their fiery thrones screaming,
cursing your name
On the terror it breeds - breathing fire and greed
watch him jest as you bleed...
Screaming enter the Damnation Game

We can not keep our heads clear,
or our tongues from evil
by this sword, certain death at our own hands

To have no wants is divine - untrue!
platinum waves tainted gold, we can only watch from
the shores

Falling into innocence by a shadow's kiss
He speaks what mortals dare to say, will he betray?

If you dare play the game - your descent preordained
from their fiery thrones screaming,
cursing your name
On the terror it breeds - breathing fire and gree
watch him jest as you bleed...
Screaming enter the Damnation Game

[solos]

If you dare play the game -
your descent preordained
from their fiery thrones screaming,
cursing your name
On the terror it breeds - breathing fire and greed
watch him laugh as you bleed...
Screaming enter the Damnation Game

[SOLO]
[Chorus]
[Chorus]

4. Dressed To Kill
[Music: Romeo, Pinnela, Miller, Rullo and Allen]

Dark desires of the cynic queen
laughter echoes her name
He feels his breath decay

Opens the past to an empty page
Watch his life drain away

Arrival - dressed to kill, scarlet memories
Watching and waiting for curtains to fall
Arrival - dressed to kill, it's a tragedy
Could you feel sympathy or pain?

In a desolate room, the canvas bleeds
He slides through his chair
rendered prince of fools

Dire thoughts of her begotten son,
Watch his life drain away
Watch his life fade away

Arrival - dressed to kill, scarlet memories
Watching and waiting for curtains to fall
Arrival - dressed to kill, it's a tragedy
Could you feel sympathy or pain?

[solo]

Arrival - dressed to kill, scarlet memories
Watching and waiting for curtains to fall
Arrival - dressed to kill, it's a tragedy
Could you feel sympathy or pain?

5. Of Sins And Shadows
[Music: Romeo, Pinnela/Lyrics: Miller]

Passing through the void
The darkest grand illusion
Chaos is riding on the wind

Destroyed in agony
They create a maddened lair
Summon all to heed their cry

Innocence fading away
- the dying eyes of prey

[Chorus]
Desperate cries, hail of fire deciding
All our fate in the night
Tempt in sin, shadows then begin to
Gather the souls they hold within

Victims of desire
Pestilence of their invasion
Forms then take on evil waves

Paralyze, victimize
The shadows fall and enter fast
from the sky - (from the sky)
Summon all to heed their cry

Innocence fading away
- the dying eyes of the prey

[Chorus]

I've betrayed - slowly fade
I repent my inner plea
I've denied - sanctified
Cannot hide form this
monstrosity

I'm immersed in a curse
Of this jaded imagery
Realize that your cries
Only jeopardize this legacy

The knife of time carves another

Good and evil - lust primeval
Dragging me into a sea of lies

Losing faith in who I am
Never changing just rearranging
my life again
Through into an eternal abyss I fall,
Silent screams through paper walls
I pray someday the sun will shine

Good and evil - lust primeval
Dragging me into a sea of lies

Lies ... lies ...

7. Out Of The Ashes
[Music: Romeo, Pinnella, Miller/Lyrics: Allen]

In the house of my master
Behind the gate there is a bed
of snakes where evil lays
Oh, I hear laughter
I forged the iron bars that
someday will imprison me

Ooh, mother will you help me
Mother will you help me
To find a reason to go on

[Chorus]
Out of the ashes of my youth
- I rise a man
And through the eyes of truth
- I finally understand
The way

I've been beaten with his words
and whipped with his lies
He will not break me down no

Pray for my lost soul
Out of control the storm inside
me rages on and on and on

Mother will you help me
Mother will you help me
To find a reason to go on

8. The Divine Wings Of Tragedy
[All music: Romeo, Pinnela, Miller]

[PART I - At the Four Corners of the Earth]
[Lyrics: Romeo, Pinnela]

On the edge of paradise
Tears of woe fall, cold as ice
Hear my cry
Renounce, have you, thy name
Eternal is my pain

Eternal is the pain that leads me
to the thrones of temptation
Eternal is the pain that leads me
to the thrones of temptation ...

[Part II - In the Room of Thrones]
[instrumental]

[PART III - A Gathering of Angels]
[Lyrics: Romeo]

There was a time ...
When nine choirs sang the
endless melody of light
Music of the spheres
There was a place ...
Where mortals embraced thunder
and majesty
Their fate lay in our hands
Feel my wings slowly fading -
forever lost in time - I cry

[PART IV - The Wrath Divine]
[Lyrics: Romeo, Miller]

The burning conflict I'm feeling
It summons me to descend into
the other side
And just beyond the stars blazing
A beam light from a red, velvet
moon illuminates me

I will devise, from perfect skies
A dark and vengeful day
Faith and mercy gone astray

With strength of infinite measure
The mighty sword divides order
from chaos in the kingdom below
And from the mansions of glory,
This empty soul cries out one
final plea ...
The end has begun

Our worlds collide, now in
disguise,
You'll feel the Wrath Divine
Tears of woe fall from the sky ...

[PART V - The Prophet's Cry]
[Lyrics: Romeo]

The prophet cries
Vast battalions rage on in the sky
Rising from the north
- the bringer of war
Eve of destruction
Summon all who have 'power
over fire'
Impending doom from shore to
shore

Standing on the edge of paradise
I sacrifice my truth and loyalty
Seven deadly sins consume you
all, a dance with death
I taste the victory

(Eternal is the pain that leads me to temptation)

Rising from the north
- the warrior prince
Judgement without compassion
eyes of fear
Like the river Styx,
the gates of hell -
"Abandon hope all ye who enter here"

The prophets cry
As armies fall from the edge of
the sky
The Prince of truth, now the
bringer of war

The day of wrath
Banish all kings from the face of the land
Dominion for strength is my
name

[PART VI - Bringer of the Apocalypse]
[instrumental]

Eve of Sacrifice/Armies in the Sky/Dies trae

[PART VII - Paradise Regained]
[Lyrics: Allen, Pinnella]

Looking out on a blue sky
I can see a new world arising
Like a prisoner unbound
I feel the power and the majesty
again

Looking up to the heavens
I can see what I left behind
Beneath the stars, moon and
warm sun
And all I know,
is my paradise has begun ...

9. Candlelight Fantasia
[Music: Romeo, Pinnela/Lyrics: Miller]

Just one more night
One more score
Another question in my mind,
can't take no more

Kissing the tears form my face as they fall
To the ground in silence in twilight and faded time
Spirits cold, with no love
Bells ring the lonely chime
Candle fires
These lit dreams can't burn alone

Winds of change bring songs upon my memory
An empty heart and soul intoxicates me
This darkened page orchestrates my final destiny
Not knowing what, what tomorrow will bring

[Chorus:]
From within the mirrors eyes
I'm forced to run away and hide
I feel those mystic eyes subside
And leave me blind
Through passages in time
I'm prisoned and locked behind the door
Lonely roses slowly wither and die

I can't escape this captive misery
Heart stone cold, under supremacy
Thrown into a raging sea of tyranny

Life's vile walls have tangled me in webs
Eternally caught in my futures threads
Play the violent strings of my symphony

[Solo]

Transcend the absence of this fantasy
Just another vision
Washed away with the tide
No place for forgotten ones
I cannot deny
What lies beyond, beyond this fantasy

[Chorus]

10. Smoke And Mirrors
[Music: Romeo, Miller/Lyrics: Miller, Allen, Romeo]

It's all perpetual dreams, this hidden life ain't what it seems
Walking dead we are
Victims of misfortune and lies, and tortured bringers of demise
Circling above like vultures

They reap the harvest that we sew and take, like trusting fools
Promising charade
All days now disappear from weeks to months, from months to years
Forever bound, shackled to the wall

The night falls, I've seen 1000 moons rising in the sky
The night calls, I feel the midnight as it slowly cloaks my eyes
Touched by the kiss of the sunrise

Live with shadows and fears--behind smoke and mirrors
Try to turn back the years--living inside smoke and mirrors

Sacred and serpentine, a hypnotizing twisted theme
Weaves our souls to roar
Like candles in the wind, our echoed cries above the din
Fade into this faceless sculpture

In the wheel of chance and fate, spinning as we watch and wait
A mystery to us all
On the edge of sanity, we tread the seas of destiny
Forever bound, silent voices call

The night falls, I've seen 1000 moons rising in the sky
The night calls, I feel the midnight as it slowly cloaks my eyes
Touched by the kiss of the sunrise

Live with shadows and fears--behind smoke and mirrors
Try to turn back the years--living inside smoke and mirrors

Live with shadows and fears--behind smoke and mirrors
Try to turn back the years--living inside smoke and mirrors

Oh.....the night calls

11. Through The Looking Glass (Part I, II, III)
[Music: Romeo, Pinnella, Miller/Lyrics: Miller, Romeo]

[Part I]

Look to the other side, reach the undefined
Curious to what she doesn't know
Step through the empty air, reveal what wasn't there
A fantasy-her looking glass world

Is it as it seems? Or just a dream within a dream
(dream within, dream within a dream)

Like she's been here before, locked behind the door
Held within the grasp of mystic hands
Everything's so strange, the same but rearranged
Through a bird's eye view-Can it all be true?

The final answer she seeks, with the three to be crowned Queen
Essence of rule divides the land-YEAH!

Dark shape, above in the sky, captures her prismatic eye
Again she walks in wonder, With no, with no tearful good-byes

[Part II]

Alice...Alice...Run Alice...Run

And there she stood, in misery
Searching for the final ring within
A dream, (dream within a dream)

Dream within a dream

"I'm not afraid..."

[Part III]

Scepter in hand-all the numbers so deceiving
The small dreaming child who wears the crown
Watches the pieces falling down

Like knights in the game-her next move is so unsure
'Waken the Queen of Nevermore
Hidden behind the royal doors

White on her right, Red on her left
Talking in riddles, on ears fallen deaf

"Stop with all the lies", all the questions so confusing
Answer the riddles they deny, losing hope, the child cries

Dream on...
Do you believe...all the things that you're seeing are true?
The start's where the end's leading you
Do you believe...all's as twisted as one would perceive?
Seek the answers...and soon you'll believe

The royal child, in a rage of desperate fury
Shattering all that lies before, screaming dolls fall to the floor
Now remove the masque, that's obscuring this dimension
Illusions so clear to me now, her invention is unwound

Escape the dream- like an unwritten book
There at my feet-lies the knight, the queen and the rook

Dream on...
Do you believe...all the things that you're seeing are true?
The start's where the end's leading you
Do you believe...all's as twisted as one would perceive?
Seek the answers...and soon you'll believe

Dream on...
Do you believe...all the things that you're seeing are true?
The start's where the end's leading you
Do you believe...all's as twisted as one would perceive?
Seek the answers...and soon you'll believe

1. Prelude
In articulus sic aeternus - Spiritus
donec dies fas
Dies Irae, Dies Illa - Solvet saeclum in
favilla

(Born) into the moment that is Forever -
To breath until that fateful day
Day of Wrath, Day of Burning - All the
world to ashes turning...

2. Evolution (The Grand Design)
[Music: Michael Romeo, Michael Pinnella]
[Lyrics: Michael Romeo, Russel Allen, Jason Rullo]

Born from the light - journey into the
moment, delivered from thought and
sky
He will be one, one with the land -
Lord of wind and the sea and the sands
The one - The bringer of life

"All will bear a part of me - let this
hollow shell set your free to live as one"

Here we are - Children of Sun and Stars
the first to know and to understand
Living by the Law of the Ages
prophets and sages - forging Utopia

Great Ptah - Khnemu - sacred priest of
the Temple of Ra and the keeper of
truth
Crystalline spheres, the power of light,
grant us keys to the stars and the
secrets of flight
'Five shall be as One'

"We unlock the mysteries of
knowledge and technology"

Here we are - Children of Sun and Stars
the first to know and to understand
Living by the Law of the Ages
prophets and sages - forging Utopia

'We shall live forever, and cast out
those less divine
Gods we will be - rulers of the sea - in
our Grand design'

Here we are - Children of Sun and Stars
the first to know and to understand
Living by the Law of the Ages
prophets and sages - forging Utopia

3. Fallen / Transcendence
[Music: Michael Romeo, Michael Pinnella, Michael Lepond, Jason Rullo]
[Lyrics: Russel Allen, Jason Rullo]

Alone I walk, among the twisting
shadows
tempted by the ancient magic, the Power
of Five
My desire to mirror my own image -
and I will offer you no soul - offer you no
soul

Tonight Darkness will shadow the Light -
Symmetry divine, there's no force greater
Dividing the Fathers of Time

Feel my hate, I'm banished to this
wasteland
my Serpents plot the overthrow of your
temples and shrines
In the night, my army's rage and fury
burning my
shadow into the land - Vengeance by my
hand

Tonight Darkness will shadow the Light -
Symmetry divine, there's no force greater
Dividing the Fathers of Time
Tonight Darkness will shadow the Light -
Paradise denied - the balance of ages
forever lost in time

Was I sure of my fateful wish to evoke
the night from the day?
Thousands now join as one - be afraid
What have I done? Clouds are dimming
the Sun with his wrath of disease and
decay
This masque of vengeance leads my
death parade
What have I done?
"My shadow burning - my shadow burns
across the land...".

Tonight Darkness will shadow the Light -
Symmetry divine, there's no force greater
Dividing the Fathers of Time
Tonight Darkness will shadow the Light -
Paradise denied - the balance of ages
forever lost in time

[Transcendence:]

[Music: Michael Romeo]

[Instrumental]

4. Communion And The Oracle
[Music: Michael Romeo, Michael Pinnella]
[Lyrics: Michael Romeo, Jason Rullo]

All we know, now has come undone
Balance lost between the Moon and Sun
Hear out prayers - Keepers of the Skies
Divine
Upon us all - let your wisdom shine

Losing faith as the madness prevails
in us all we are searching for a reason,
a need to calm the storm
In our sails - let your winds be strong

Breathe the air around you
The oceans fill your veins and winds
embrace your heart
Feel the change within you
The Sun and Moon align - The Grand
Design awaits a new start

From the skies, looking down on you
Through the clouds tainted crystal blue
"Such advancement, yet lacking the
control,
so unaware of your earthly roles"

Praise this child and the words of her
rhyme
A sacred gift - Magic of the Five will
bring you tranquillity
A new order of equality

Five senses come alive - Five reasons
thrive - Five nations unite - Unite as
one
Night and Day will find a way to keep
the Balance true
Let the Sky and Stars be your guide -
the destination is up to you

Raise our heads up to the Skies
Feel the essence of Time
Changing ways like the shifting tides
In the waves hear the Rhyme

5. The Bird-Serpent War / Cataclysm
[Music: Michael Romeo, Michael Pinnela]
[Lyrics: Michael Romeo, Michael Pinnella]

Mocking the ways of Justice - the
Serpent's Dragon - Vultures ride
Storming the Gates of Seven - no mortal
man shall break our stride
Our flames engulf your good works and
our terror reigns supreme
Dark beasts that do my bidding by
thrashing, tearing down your dreams

"Gather 'round chosen people of the
Grand Design
Scorn the prophet's words - 'the device
of our demise'..."

The crumbling earth beneath the
weapon's roar -
Raining fire from shore to shore
Neptune's might - the storming waves
rise to make the Kingdom's grave

And all Atlantis cried - a million souls
crying out
Save the child from the Sea - she must
carry on
The secrets and technology shrouded
deep in mystery -
only One will carry on - Carry on...

6. On The Breath of Poseidon
[Instrumental]

7. Egypt
[Music: Michael Romeo, Michael Pinnella, Michael Lepond]
[Lyrics: Michael Romeo, Russel Allen, Jason Rullo]

Endless sands of Alnantees - etched in
gold, a city lost in time
and from the Sea - A Child speaks of
things unseen,
before the King - a teller of the Rhyme

Five align - hidden in the word a
message locked in time
find the Key - it draws the final line
between what is and what should never
be

Gaze in these eyes my child and see -
here by my side, you're destined to be
Fears in the night flee with the Sun - if
we are One
Kingdom of Gold I lay at your feet -
Ruler of Time and Space you will be
Rivers of Truth forever will run - if we
are One

From the ruins of Atlantis, the Lord of
Night rises from the sands
He seeks the one - his serpent's tail and
twisted tongue -
a bringer of War - Destroyer of the land

Five align - hidden in the word a
message locked in time
find the Key - it draws the final line
between what is and what should never
be

"Rise my minions - from within the deep abyss
my disciples - thunder this necropolis"

Gaze in these eyes my child and see -
here by my side, you're destined to be
Fears in the night chasing the Sun - now
we are One
Kingdom of Gold now lay at my feet -
Ruler of Time and Space I will be
Rivers of Lies forever will run - now we
are One

8. Death of Balance / Candlelight Fantasia
[Death of Balance:]

[Music: Michael Romeo, Jason Rullo]

[Instrumental:]

[Candlelight Fantasia:]

[Music: Michael Romeo, Michael Pinnela]
[Lyrics: Thomas Miller]

Just one more night
One more score
Another question in my mind,
can't take no more

Kissing the tears form my face as they fall
To the ground in silence in twilight and faded time
Spirits cold, with no love
Bells ring the lonely chime
Candle fires
These lit dreams can't burn alone

Winds of change bring songs upon my memory
An empty heart and soul intoxicates me
This darkened page orchestrates my final destiny
Not knowing what, what tomorrow will bring

From within the mirrors eyes
I'm forced to run away and hide
I feel those mystic eyes subside
Through passages in time
I'm prisoned and locked behind the door
Lonely roses slowly wither and die

9. The Eyes of Medusa
[Music: Michael Romeo, Michael Pinnela, Thomas Miller]
[Lyrics: Thomas Miller]

Can you look into my eyes
Tell me, now do you somehow
still recognize this stare I wear
Through crystal tears

The light escapes my smile
There is no likeness to be seen,
it is so strange to me

Awaken vindication
The mirrors curse-it besets me

Endless, timeless, faceless terror
To the isle of deadly shores
Sightless, countless, ageless
torture
To behold the sight of Medusa's
eyes

Under a spell - I'm enchanted
The hand of fate is never late to
ring the time
I'm forced to climb the walls

A voice bids last farewell
With no beginning or no end to
be found by me

Endless, timeless, faceless terror
To the isle of deadly shores
Sightless, countless, ageless
torture
To behold the sight of Medusa's
eyes

[Solo]

Endless, timeless, faceless terror
To the isle of deadly shores
Sightless, countless, ageless
torture
To behold the sight of Medusa's
eyes

10. Smoke And Mirrors
[Music: Michael Romeo, Thomas Miller]
[Lyrics: Thomas Miller, Russel Allen, Romeo]

It's all perpetual dreams, this hidden life ain't what it seems
Walking dead we are
Victims of misfortune and lies, and tortured bringers of demise
Circling above like vultures

They reap the harvest that we sew and take, like trusting fools
Promising charade
All days now disappear from weeks to months, from months to years
Forever bound, shackled to the wall

The night falls, I've seen 1000 moons rising in the sky
The night calls, I feel the midnight as it slowly cloaks my eyes
Touched by the kiss of the sunrise

Live with shadows and fears--behind smoke and mirrors
Try to turn back the years--living inside smoke and mirrors

Sacred and serpentine, a hypnotizing twisted theme
Weaves our souls to roar
Like candles in the wind, our echoed cries above the din
Fade into this faceless sculpture

In the wheel of chance and fate, spinning as we watch and wait
A mystery to us all
On the edge of sanity, we tread the seas of destiny
Forever bound, silent voices call

The night falls, I've seen 1000 moons rising in the sky
The night calls, I feel the midnight as it slowly cloaks my eyes
Touched by the kiss of the sunrise

Live with shadows and fears--behind smoke and mirrors
Try to turn back the years--living inside smoke and mirrors

Live with shadows and fears--behind smoke and mirrors
Try to turn back the years--living inside smoke and mirrors

Oh.....the night calls

11. Church of the Machine
[Music & Lyrics: Symphony X]

I'm the master, looking down from the edge of space and time
Flesh and steel intertwined
I am the future, sacrifice your soul and succumb to me
Nailed to your faith, you'll believe

Scream-and no one hears my pleas
Faceless masses falling to their knees

Bow down in the platinum maze
Twilight cathedrals spread the system plague
Forging sacred thrones in the void unseen
Merciless judgement in the church of the machine

Pyramids in the sky, playing out their cosmic games
Rulers of us all, forever cursed we live in pain
Cursed-we live in pain...

The creator, 'Neath the darkened sun, my empires rise
Artificially devised
The destroyer, fierce intentions flow from a virtual rage
Forever lost and enslaved

Total mesh of soul and steel
Life-force force under my command
Twisted baptism of fire
Between machine and man

Scream-and no one hears my pleas
Faceless masses falling to their knees

Bow down in the platinum maze
Twilight cathedrals spread the system plague
Forging sacred thrones in the void unseen
Merciless judgement in the church of the machine

Bow down in the platinum maze
Twilight cathedrals spread the system plague
Forging sacred thrones in the void unseen
Merciless judgement in the church of the machine

13. Of Sins And Shadows
[Music: Michael Romeo, Michael Pinnela]
[Lyrics: Thomas Miller]

Passing through the void
The darkest grand illusion
Chaos is riding on the wind

Destroyed in agony
They create a maddened lair
Summon all to heed their cry

Innocence fading away
- the dying eyes of prey

Desperate cries, hail of fire deciding
All our fate in the night
Tempt in sin, shadows then begin to
Gather the souls they hold within

Victims of desire
Pestilence of their invasion
Forms then take on evil waves

Paralyze, victimize
The shadows fall and enter fast
from the sky - (from the sky)
Summon all to heed their cry

Innocence fading away
- the dying eyes of the prey

Desperate cries, hail of fire deciding
All our fate in the night
Tempt in sin, shadows then begin to
Gather the souls they hold within

I've betrayed - slowly fade
I repent my inner plea
I've denied - sanctified
Cannot hide form this
monstrosity

I'm immersed in a curse
Of this jaded imagery
Realize that your cries
Only jeopardize this legacy

[Solo]

Desperate cries, hail of fire deciding
All our fate in the night
Tempt in sin, shadows then begin to
Gather the souls they hold within

14. Sea of Lies
[Music: Michael Romeo, Michael Pinnella, Thomas Miller]
[Lyrics: Russel Allen]

Today I've seen the shallow face I wear
Inside this shell,
a living hell endures
I'm held captive by my fear,
decaying hope and wasted years
The knife of time carves another
line around these eyes

Good and evil - lust primeval
Dragging me into a sea of lies

Losing faith in who I am
Never changing just rearranging
my life again
Through into an eternal abyss I fall,
Silent screams through paper walls
I pray someday the sun will shine
on me again (shine on me again)

Good and evil - lust primeval
Dragging me into a sea of lies

Lies ... lies ...

[Solo]

Lies ... lies ...

15. The Divine Wings of Tragedy
[All Music: Michael Romeo, Michael Pinnela, Thomas Miller]

[Part I - At the Four Corners of the Earth]
[Lyrics: Romeo, Pinnela]

On the edge of paradise

[Part IV - The Wrath Divine]
[Lyrics: Michael Romeo, Thomas Miller]

The burning conflict I'm feeling
It summons me to descend into
the other side
And just beyond the stars blazing
A beam light from a red, velvet
moon illuminates me

I will devise, from perfect skies
A dark and vengeful day
Faith and mercy gone astray

With strength of infinite measure
The mighty sword divides order
from chaos in the kingdom below
And from the mansions of glory,
This empty soul cries out one
final plea ...
The end has begun

Our worlds collide, now in
disguise,
You'll feel the Wrath Divine
Tears of woe fall from the sky ...

Seven deadly sins consume you

3. Sonata
[Based on a theme from Sonata #8 in C minor by Ludwig van Beethoven]

[Instrumental]

4. Into The Dragon's Den
[Music: Michael Romeo, Thomas Miller, Michael Pinnella]
[Lyrics: Symphony X]

Placid skies, through crystal gazing eyes
Slaves to our desire, in a ring of smoke and fire
The dungeons call, two faces on the wall
Candles light the way, for a moonlight serenade

Through the nights and days, we will find a way
A way to carry on what we believe

An empty door, ashes on the floor
Hypnotic array of lights, dragons calling throughout the night
Omen in black, chained down to the rack
The end never in sight, soaring through an endless plight

Through the nights and days, we will find a way

Silence fills the shrine, giving us the sign
Forever lost, forever in the dragon's den
Born with second sight, essence burning bright
Forever lost, forever in the dragon's den

Silence fills the shrine, giving us the sign
Forever lost, forever in the dragon's den
Born with second sight, essence burning bright
Forever lost, forever in the dragon's den

Look to the other side, reach the undefined
Curious to what she doesn't know
Step through the empty air, reveal what wasn't there
A fantasy-her looking glass world

Is it as it seems? Or just a dream within a dream
(dream within, dream within a dream)

Like she's been here before, locked behind the door
Held within the grasp of mystic hands
Everything's so strange, the same but rearranged
Through a bird's eye view-Can it all be true?

The final answer she seeks, with the three to be crowned Queen
Essence of rule divides the land-YEAH!

Dark shape, above in the sky, captures her prismatic eye
Again she walks in wonder, With no, with no tearful good-byes

[Part II:]
Alice...Alice...Run Alice...Run

And there she stood, in misery
Searching for the final ring within
A dream, (dream within a dream)

Dream within a dream

"I'm not afraid..."

[Part III:]
Scepter in hand-all the numbers so deceiving
The small dreaming child who wears the crown
Watches the pieces falling down

Like knights in the game-her next move is so unsure
'Waken the Queen of Nevermore
Hidden behind the royal doors

White on her right, Red on her left
Talking in riddles, on ears fallen deaf

"Stop with all the lies", all the questions so confusing
Answer the riddles they deny, losing hope, the child cries

Dream on...
Do you believe...all the things that you're seeing are true?
The start's where the end's leading you
Do you believe...all's as twisted as one would perceive?
Seek the answers...and soon you'll believe

The royal child, in a rage of desperate fury
Shattering all that lies before, screaming dolls fall to the floor
Now remove the masque, that's obscuring this dimension
Illusions so clear to me now, her invention is unwound

Escape the dream- like an unwritten book
There at my feet-lies the knight, the queen and the rook

Dream on...
Do you believe...all the things that you're seeing are true?
The start's where the end's leading you
Do you believe...all's as twisted as one would perceive?
Seek the answers...and soon you'll believe

Dream on...
Do you believe...all the things that you're seeing are true?
The start's where the end's leading you
Do you believe...all's as twisted as one would perceive?
Seek the answers...and soon you'll believe

6. The Relic
[Music: Michael Romeo, Michael Pinnela, Thomas Miller]
[Lyrics: Russel Allen, Thomas Miller]

Silver cross in ancient halls, deep inside the castle walls
Bound to sleep, forever locked in chains
Evil carved into the stone, ancient words they've never known
A serpent's silent shroud still remains

Come with me and I'll make all your wishes come true
Lifting the chains of oppression from you
Wiping away the lines carved in your face
Take the Relic from this place...

Carry on, into the horizon, wielding courage, staff in hand
Journey on, through shadows and dreams, and what lies beyond the guardian's keep

Prey and siege in voiceless woe, who's dust was scattered long ago
Awaken from the dark and endless sleep
Man's desires-now mortal wounds, believing tales and shallow truths
Hardened hearts now tremble in the keep

Trust in me and I'll lay all your nightmares to waste
Take the Relic from this place

Carry on, into the horizon, wielding courage, staff in hand
Journey on, through shadows and dreams, and what lies beyond the guardian's keep

7. Orion - The Hunter
[Music: Michael Romeo, Thomas Miller]
[Lyrics: Thomas Miller, Russel Allen]

Child of the oceans I am, walking on the waves
Stirring the pools, I silence and calm the tides to a glaze
Touched by a vision of love, her beauty recognized
Elusive to me, progressions are now violence in disguise

On a quest for light, and braving the seas
Chasing the morning star, wait for me...
Now I'm blinded, this vision I cannot see
I cannot see my future destiny

Ohh...the hunter looks at you with eyes to kill
Praying for your life-the mighty rage against the still

For whom the God's destroy, they first make mad
Receiving the sun, and falling like hourglass sand
Child of the sea I am, in starlight I reside
Glow silver and white, eternal and bright in the sky

On a quest for light, and braving the seas
Chasing the morning star, wait for me...
Now I'm blinded, this vision I cannot see
I cannot see my future destiny

Ohh...the hunter looks at you with eyes to kill
Praying for your life-the mighty rage against the still

Ohh...the hunter looks at you with eyes to kill
Praying for your life-the mighty rage against the still

Ohh...the hunter
Ohh...the hunter
Ohh...the hunter
I'm the hunter

8. Lady Of The Snow
[Music: Michael Romeo, Michael Pinnela]
[Lyrics: Thomas Miller, Russel Allen]

Garden of ice, ivory trees dimly glow
Maiden in white, led by lanterns of stone

Captured-by the light of moon
Diamonds and Jade-dressed in ashen blue

From the North, a mistress dressed in silvery blaze
The feel of her kiss steals my breath away
In the night, shadows dance through lucid doors
With a pale and frigid gaze

Lady of the snow, calling me
Her silhouette awaits in the cold
A kiss of stone, tempting me
Radiant lady in white, Maiden of the Snow
A winter's stare through veils that still my sight
In the night...she calls

Bound by this passion, I'm begging you please let me go
There is no escaping the feeling, I can't fight anymore

My desire echoes from a tale of ancient lore
As before, mystery fills my eyes
Beauty and bliss, I feel the hands that hold me now
I surrender myself to the night

Lady of the snow, calling me
Her silhouette awaits in the cold
A kiss of stone, tempting me
Radiant lady in white, Maiden of the Snow
A winter's stare through veils that still my sight
In the night...she calls

Lady of the snow, holding me
Her silhouette awaits in the cold
I can't fight anymore

1. The Damnation Game
[Music: Michael Romeo, Michael Pinnela, Miller, Jason Rullo and Russel Allen]

Forever cursed by this game, he who plays with sin
Incantations summoned up our creations

We're players cast in this tale, believe it
stranger than fiction
This justice thunders our condemnation

Falling into innocence by a shadow's kiss
He speaks what mortals dare to say, will he betray?

If you dare play the game - your descent preordained
from their fiery thrones screaming,
cursing your name
On the terror it breeds - breathing fire and gree
watch him jest as you bleed...
Screaming enter the Damnation Game

We can not keep our heads clear,
or our tongues from evil
by this sword, certain death at our own hands

To have no wants is divine - untrue!
platinum waves tainted gold, we can only watch from
the shores

Falling into innocence by a shadow's kiss
He speaks what mortals dare to say, will he betray?

If you dare play the game - your descent preordained
from their fiery thrones screaming,
cursing your name
On the terror it breeds - breathing fire and gree
watch him jest as you bleed...
Screaming enter the Damnation Game

[Solo]

If you dare play the game -
your descent preordained
from their fiery thrones screaming,
cursing your name
On the terror it breeds - breating fire and greed
watch him laugh as you bledd...
Screaming enter the Damnation Game

[Solo]

If you dare play the game - your descent preordained
from their fiery thrones screaming,
cursing your name
On the terror it breeds - breathing fire and gree
watch him jest as you bleed...
Screaming enter the Damnation Game

2. Dressed To Kill
[Music: Michael Romeo, Michael Pinnela, Thomas Miller, Jason Rullo and Russel Allen]

Dark desires of the cynic queen
laugher echoes her name
He feels his breath decay

Opens the past to an empty page
Watch his life drain away

Arrival - dressed to kill, scarlet memories
Watching and waiting for curtains to fall
Arrival - dressed to kill, it's a tragedy
Could you feel sympathy or pain?

In a desolate room, the canvas bleeds
He slides through his chair
rendered prince of fools

Dire thoughts of her begotten son,
Watch his life drain away
Watch his life fade away

Arrival - dressed to kill, scarlet memories
Watching and waiting for curtains to fall
Arrival - dressed to kill, it's a tragedy
Could you feel sympathy or pain?

[Solo]

Arrival - dressed to kill, scarlet memories
Watching and waiting for curtains to fall
Arrival - dressed to kill, it's a tragedy
Could you feel sympathy or pain?

3. The Edge Of Forever
[Music: Michael Romeo, Michael Pinnela, Thomas Miller, Jason Rullo and Russel Allen]

Pictures of what used to be,
lie in pieces on the floor
finds himself in an empty room,
her voice calls out to him
he opens the door, but there's no one there
no one there...

Draped in a silken glow of moonlight
through the mist I see, a lucid cathedral appears to me.
pray for a glimpse of touch of sunlight
chain our shadow down, night settles in, my love,
you never make a sound.

Love is flowing from my fingertips
never in control of this domain.
All around me, my essence lay
watch the vultures circle through the pouring rain.

Close your eyes - and try to remember
discordant lullabies of days gone by.
Close your eyes - on the edge of forever
a chance to dream, fast asleep your nightmare ends.

As the walls converge around me.
castles crumbling down, everything is not
as it seems to be.

Once more, I fells I must return
no more will my soul burn. Dawn breaks the ground,
my love,
and with it you fade away...

Close your eyes - and try to remember
discordant lullabies of days gone by.
Close your eyes - on the edge of forever
a chance to dream, fast asleep your nightmare ends.

[solo]

Close your eyes - and try to remember
discordant lullabies of days gone by.
Close your eyes - on the edge of forever
a chance to dream, fast asleep your nightmare ends.

My love never dies...

4. Savage Curtain
[Music: Michael Romeo, Michael Pinnela, Thomas Miller, Jason Rullo and Russel Allen]

Besiege me not for what I am
a man with intent in the Devil's den
for I know not what to believe
yet mad I am not in trust I deceive
Radical alterations in my temper
grows worse day by day
I will offer you extreme opposition

Savage curtain closes in on you
but I do grieve the evident
behind this illusion

The fury of demons possessing me
my fiendish corruption will fill my need
every reason to fulfill my deed.
Have we not a perpetual inclination
to violate that witch is law merely
because we know it is to be?

Savage curtain closes in on you
but I do grieve the evident
behind this illusion

[Solo]

Savage curtain closes in on you
but I do grieve the evident
behind this illusion

5. Whispers
[Music: Michael Romeo, Michael Pinnela, Thomas Miller, Jason Rullo and Russel Allen]

When all the angels cry
sadness reigns upon us all
white doves fade to black

With the absence of the heart
we could never smile
we can feel the bitter tears

Whispers from you - calling out from above
visions I can't see, like the wind and your love
whispers to you - calling out through the night
words I can't hear, graceful figure in white

And when you watch over me
please guide me all the way
you're my judge and my jury

As I lay my head to rest
your absence will surround me
and I'll die another death

Whispers from you - calling out from above
visions I can't see, like the wind and your love
Whispers to you - calling out through the night
words I can't hear, graceful figure in white

[Solo]

Whispers from you - calling out from above
visions I can't see, like the wind and your love
Whispers to you - calling out through the night
words I can't hear, graceful figure in white

6. The Haunting
[Music: Michael Romeo, Michael Pinnela, Thomas Miller, Jason Rullo and Russel Allen]

Lightning flashes across the sky
the hands of time keep falling like the pouring rain
Soft voice call my name; I've seen this place before
This whole thing is mad and still I can see
that he awaits for me

As the knife cuts to the vein
am I going insane? Have I lost my mind?
Ten years gone by, my friend, haunting me
scars will fade but never die

Prisioner waiting out my time
looking back through years gone by
My mind is always wondering what can I do
to seal a different fate,
can I undo the things I've done?
I lie on the ground without making a sound
and cry for my life
again

As the knife cuts to the vein
am I going insane? Have I lost my mind?
Ten years gone by, my friend, haunting me
scars will fade but never die

Staring down at me
through my eyes I can see
al the terror and pain still live on
I can't leave
silver strand is pulling me back to mortality

[Solo]

As the knife cuts to the vein
am I going insane? Have I lost my mind?
Ten years gone by, my friend, haunting me
scars will fade but never die

7. Secrets
[Music: Michael Romeo, Michael Pinnela, Thomas Miller, Jason Rullo and Russel Allen]

Deep within a tiny box, shadowed truth under the locks
Burns inside your heart - then it starts

Your soul stretched on the rack
the straw that breaks the back
Watch the make-up crack...

Got no peace of mind, now you're going blind
Secrets within, living in sin.
No one needs to know, watch the cancer grow
Feel it eating - Secrets within.

Secrets hurt if they are told, someone's trust you will
have sold - Don't tell a soul.
Hear the cry inside of you, live the lie or speak the
truth - when will it end?

Your soul stretched on the rack
the straw that breaks the back
Watch the make - up crack...

Got no peace of mind, now you're going blind
Secrets within, living in sin.
No one better know, feel the cancer grow
Feel it eating - Secrets within your mind.

[Solo]

Got no peace of mind, now you're going blind
Secrets within, living in sin.
No one needs to know, watch the cancer grow
Feel it eating - Secrets within your mind.

8. A Winter's Dream - Prelude (Part I)
[Music: Michael Romeo, Michael Pinnela, Thomas Miller, Jason Rullo and Russel Allen]

Although your words are empty,
I can hear now, what you feel inside

The night is drawing closer,
you fell you have to hide.

Your fears are never wrong or right
Everything is either black or white.

It's time to close your eyes now,
begin your fantasy - what does it mean?
Wake your dreams (commence now...)
into reality.

Your fears are never wrong or right
Everything is either black or white.

In a Winter's Dream - I'll be there for you
In a Winter's Dream - I'll be there for you

9. A Winter's Dream - The Ascension (Part II)
[Music: Michael Romeo, Michael Pinnela, Thomas Miller, Jason Rullo and Russel Allen]

Still in bed an hour past,
I'm drifting through the void.
As fallen star divides the sky of divinity.

Taken on a journey,
and enlightened to the past.
And if I wake, if I wake, will it embrace me?

Awoke at dawn to calm the storm inside of me.
Take my last breath as I fall into eternity...

Risen to an astral flight, I wander through
Serene with you.
Answers to the voices I hear,
In a Winter's Dream, a dream.

Empty minds still wait, I'm here.
Captured by light - my spirit rides through the
night.
And if I dream to wake - will it embrace me?

When the story fades and all is said done,
I can not wait - pray for daybreak -
Will it escape me?

Awoke at dawn to calm the storm inside of me.
Take my last breath as I fall into eternity...

Risen to an astral flight, I wander through
the serene with you.
Answers to the voices I hear,
In a Winter's Dream, a dream.

[Solo]

In a Winter's Dream - I'll be there for you
In a Winter's Dream - I'll be there for you

Risen to an astral flight, I wander through
the serene with.
Answers to the voices I hear,
In a Winter's Dream, a dream.

1. Inferno (Unleash The Fire)
[music - Romeo]
[lyrics - Allen, Romeo]

Welcome to the Anarchy
Enigmatic entity
The grand illusion - destitution
infecting one and all

Forces they're oppressing me
Lords of mediocrity
an iron will shall break the still
some will rise and some will fall

Oh... yes, we ride through stormy skies of Fire

Evil lies that mesmerize
from the dragons' tongue they slide
a fury lashes from the ashes
never losing sight

Pounding down the wicked ones
Tyrants now are overcome
A final yell from hounds of Hell
rising we unite

Yes we ride through stormy skies

The endless nights
In the moonlight, we do gather
We curse uncertainty and false desires
We lift the mask
and stand together - one and all
and when the flames grow dim, look within
Unleash the Fire...

A time will come
when all will see: In the end - it's just a game
Time will tell
when all these things that have come to pass - still remain

Oh... Yes we ride through stormy skies

The endless nights
In the moonlight, we do gather
We curse uncertainty and false desires
We lift the mask
and stand together - one and all
and when the flames grow dim, look within
Unleash the Fire...

2. Wicked
[music - Romeo]
[lyrics - Allen]

Alone I traveled through the mountains
Led by a star fading west
When I came upon an ancient ruin of a church
and it was there I stopped to rest

Then the black and gloomy night that chased my footsteps
crashed down on me like a wave
Whispering through the trees and eerie breeze
carried a voice beckoning me to be her slave

In a whisper she said...

Burn forever
Leave never from my arms
Embrace the night

From the black and twisting shadows rose a woman
beauty alluring to the eye
Oh her devilish grin, her moonlit skin
and long dark hair flowing down around her thighs

As she approached I felt the evil growing stronger
I waltz with the wicked within
Frozen in my place, she kissed my face
and in a storm of passion bathed me in sin

In the madness...she said...

Burn forever
Leave never from my arms
Embrace the night

Then she weaved a mist - and cast me into the shadows

"Come with me, love eternally, forever mine"
"Set me free - in death we'll dance eternally forever and ever..."

As so the light, cast down from the heavens,
washed over me like wave
I awoke, it seems, from some crazy dream
only to find I was standing at her grave

In my nightmare...she said

Burn forever
Leave never from my arms
Embrace the night

Burn forever
Leave never from my arms
Don't ever leave me- never leave me

Burn forever
Leave never from my arms
Embrace the night

3. Incantations Of The Apprentice
[music - Romeo]
[lyrics - Allen]

Through eerie reach of ancient woods
where lumbering mists arise
I journey for nines moons of the year
to where a land of legend lies

Deep within a stony lamp-lit hall
under falling grains of sand
Magic eyes glance magic pages
turned by magic hands

And as he spoke I watched in awe
A God's aura in his eyes
Master of all

Darkness fall - Spirits arise
Lord of Storms - Blacken the skies

With heavy breath, I break the seal
howls echo through the room
Blood lettings of a black Raven's heart
Conjure up the wraiths of doom

I cannot heed my Master's call
Lakes of Fire - writhe and swell
Foolish eyes - while spying Prophet's pages
unleash Barons of Hell

And as they rose I watched in awe
A God's aura in my eyes
Master of all

Darkness fall - Spirits arise
Lord of Storms - Blacken the skies

4. Accolade II
[music - Romeo, Pinnella, Lepond]
[lyrics - Allen]

On a cold and misty night,
a ring of torches light the hallowed ground
where his father's laid to rest

In the reflection of the sword
he sees his destiny and he swears up to the sky -
"You will not have died in vain"

On the field - with sword and shield
amidst the din of dying man's wails
War is waged - and the battle will rage
until only the righteous prevail

From the shadows comes a man,
returning to his land - Winds of change
taint the sweet smell of home

And all around him, he can see
the pain and misery
this tyrant's reign is through
"I will stand and fight... Will you?"

A heart of gold pumps within his metal skin
A noble line he carries on

On the field - with sword and shield
amidst the din of dying man's wails
War is waged - and the battle will rage
until only the righteous prevail

I wish to stay...to be here with you
You were my strength...How can I go on?

On the field - with sword and shield
amidst the din of dying man's wails
War is waged - and the battle will rage
until only the righteous prevail

5. King Of Terrors
[music - Romeo, Pinnella]
[lyrics - Allen, Romeo, Rullo]

I awake - without the sun
encased in walls of steel
terror so real - it blinds me

Rancid darkness steals my breath
The Pit - on the edge of death
The wells of Hell know not my name

I slip away...into black I fade away

Terrified - to the left and to the right
Spirits of the Damned, iron shadows cast
Hear my desperate cries
Shrieking demon - far and wide
praying for this breath to be my last

Awake again - paralyzed
I'm shackled to this alter
sacrificed to their God

'Inch by Inch and Line by Line'
The Blade - descending lost in time
The fiends of Doom they call my name

I slip away... into black I fade away

Terrified - to the left and to the right
Spirits of the Damned, iron shadows cast
Hear my desperate cries
Shrieking demon - far and wide
praying for this breath to be my last

"The Inquisitorial vengeance
had been hurried by my two-fold escape,
and there was to be no more dallying
with the King of Terrors..."
[Edgar Allan Poe - The Pit and the Pendulum]

Terrified - to the left and to the right
Spirits of the Damned, iron shadows cast
Hear my desperate cries
Shrieking demon - far and wide
praying for this breath to be my last

6. The Turning
[music - Romeo, Lepond]
[lyrics - Allen, Romeo]

Lurking out of sight
Night shall fall and feed my frenzy
Beneath an eerie moon a change comes over me

Eyes glow by candlelight
a face divided in the mirror
my psyche ripped by daggers of my alchemy

Side by side with myself again
As midnight's curse descends on trembling hands

Oh - save my soul
losing control when the bells toll

Savage on the prowl
In the lamplight's glow - nocturnal
my breath hangs like ghosts in the evening air

This ill effect - a vile creation
of my design - abomination
the madness rages on and on...

Side by side with myself again
As midnight's curse descends on trembling hands

Oh - save my soul
losing control when the bells toll
Oh - feed my soul
I'm in control - when the bells toll

Oh - save my soul
losing control when the bells toll
Oh - feed my soul
I'm in control - when the bells toll
You'll be forever mine

7. Awakenings
[music - Romeo, Pinnella, Lepond]
[lyrics - Allen, Romeo]

Needless to say, another day has passed away
Yet everything, and nothing, has changed
Awake I lie, my thoughts get lost up in the sky
Needless to say, nothing will change...

Maybe a mystic - with fortunes to tell...
Surrender my coin at the old wishing well...
Maybe the stars will align in the night...
To show me the path that is right

'Would've been's and 'could've been's
they waste my days away
the colors of my life dissolve and fade to gray

So many paths of promise
Indecision poisons my mind
If only I had seen the signs - so blind

Oh, so blind...

Oh, Yet I must journey on - on and on

A haunting vision torments me
It smothers and steals my dreams
I see an old man in the mirror
cold and bitter starring back at me

Here I am - at the crossing of life I stand
On my own - looking down the road
Hear my cry - answer me
Still I'm searching yet the truth is unknown - though the night is cold
I walk the road alone

8. The Odyssey
[Part I: Odysseus' Theme / Overture]

[Music / orchestration: Romeo]

[Instrumental]

[Part II: Journey to Ithaca]

[Music: Romeo, lyrics: Allen, Romeo]

To the one that I love, my journey has begun
When our eyes meet once more there will be peace
The taste of your lips the warmth of your touch
again, forever, two souls as one

Seems like forever that my eyes have been denied
Home - I'm dreaming of the home
I've been twenty years away from all I ever knew
to return would make my dream come true

Seasons of sorrow have stolen all my years
I miss the rolling hills of Ithaca
I've been through battles and cried a sea of tears
but the tide is changing, and with it all my fears

Seems like forever that my eyes have been denied
Home - I'm dreaming of the home
I've been twenty years away from all I ever knew
to return would make my dream come true

Behold the sea and winds of Jove
We set sail guided by the stars above
The ports of Troy escape our view
a cold and stormy fate awaits our rendezvous

Onward we ride, into the raging fury
Setting our course by the moon and sun
We forge ahead seeking glory
Yet the journey has just begun

Onward we ride - nine days we brave her might
we are coming home...

[Part III: The Eye]

[Music: Romeo, lyrics: Romeo]

Awakened at dawn - Land dead ahead
with the winds of the morning we change course
no remorse, a place forbidden to all

Search all the grounds - find food and water
Yet journey not into the Cave of Woe
long ago, a legend spoke of a beast

A thousand riches hidden deep within the stone
A thousand nightmares mortal blood forever flows

A mountainous black - engulfed in a shadow
a bone-chilling growl and an Eye of Hate
a ghastly fate - held prisoner by the Eye

Yet he must sleep - as the daylight fades
we focus our senses and sharpen our blade
we take aim - In silence we strike

A thousand riches hidden deep within the stone
A thousand nightmares - blood runs forever - from the Eye...

[Part IV: Circe (Daughter of the Sun)]

[Music: Romeo, lyrics: Romeo]

We sit adrift on the open sea
The gift of wind, by Zeus, concealed - so carelessly
We break the waves on a course untrue
across the endless plain of blue - a new coast in view

Yeah...

We carouse with the maiden
beneath her eyes the madness lies
...in mystery

I drink deep from the chalice
of gold and jade - my senses fade
...I'm mesmerized

Stay - like those before
I condemn you all - from walk to crawl
...metamorphasized

No - my will it defies her
speak the verse - lift the curse
...she's mesmerized

Am I asleep?
Tell me Daughter of the Sun
There's vengeance in the air and all things must be undone

[Part V: Sirens]

[Music: Romeo, lyrics: Romeo]

Dire warnings -
told by the sorceress in white
'false bringers of love' - Sirens
echoing songs from above

Wings flowing -
floating on Sea of Lies
I defy their vision
Elysium swallows my cries

Embracing -
maidens of lust stimulate
and manipulate my senses
I welcome a watery grave

Tied steadfast to the mast
tragedy awaits me
I'm falling victim
betrayed by the sea

[Part VI: Scylla and Charybdis]

[a) Gulf of Doom]
[b) Drifting Home]

[Music / orchestration: Romeo]

[Instrumental]

[Part VII: The Fate of the Suitors / Champion of Ithaca]

[music: Romeo, lyrics: Lepond, Romeo]

So this is home...
In the guise of a beggar - Minerva guides my way
I find my kingdom in jeopardy

Vengeance - it swells within me
As I spy so many who eye my Queen
I'll make them pay for this blasphemy... All will see

Triumphant - Champion of Ithaca
I will right all the wrongs
Let the Gods sing my song
Triumphant - Champion of Ithaca
Let a new life begin
my journey has come to and end

A contest of valor
'to pierce all the rings
in a single arrow's flight'
Yet, not a one can string the bow

My veil of silence lifted
All is revealed
revenge burns in my heart
thrashing and slashing down all my foes... to claim the throne

Triumphant - Champion of Ithaca
I will right all the wrongs
Let the Gods sing my song
Triumphant - Champion of Ithaca
Let a new life begin
this is the end of my Odyssey

Seems like forever that my eyes have been denied
Home - I'm finally home
I've been twenty years away from all I ever knew
I have returned to make my dream come true

9. Masquerade
[Bonus track]

Shackled in darkness
The forbidden portrait confined to its frame
Unbroken silence
A total misfortune and shame

Raging obsession
This mask of opression
It hides your aggression from view
This tearing suture
Renounces the love he once knew

You sacrifice this paradise of innocence
Trust the lie - you falsify the line of truth
You disguise your insolence
Don't deny insanity - mediocrity

[Chorus]
Save us from this masquerade of lies
Kings and fools die in ridicule (save us)
Save us from this masquerade of lies

A fallen fortress sees him beneath starless skies
Subsiding deeper - the final farewell in his eyes

Unspoken hero
Distrust and thrusted within surmise
Seizing intrusion to unveil his clever disguise

You sacrifice this paradise of innocence
Trust the lie - you falsify the line of truth

[Chorus]

[Solo]

[Chorus]

10. Frontiers
[Japanese Bonus Track]

Yeah yeah

Sailing across the seas far and wide
We alone pierce the gloom of the night
We search for answers to riddles all this time
And with the sunset, our land fades from sight

Heading out (we are)
Far from home (and we)
Seek to conquer the great unknown (the great unknown)
Riding steadfast (on the)
Breath of God
We'll reach for the stars and beyond

Mission status: All systems go
Counting down the engine's light, ooh
Blazing progress, our beacon sears the skies
And with the moonset our planet fades from sight

Heading out (we are)
Far from home (and we)
Seek to conquer the great unknown (the great unknown)
Riding steadfast (on the)
Breath of God
We'll reach for the stars and beyond

Yeah yeah
Ride the night

Heading out (we are)
Far from home (and we)
Seek to conquer the great unknown (the great unknown)
Riding steadfast (on the)
Breath of God
We'll reach for the stars and beyond (Reach for the stars!)

Heading out (we are)
Far from home (and we)
Seek to conquer the great unknown

1. Prelude
In articulus sic aeternus - Spiritus
donec dies fas
Dies Irae, Dies Illa - Solvet saeclum in
favilla

(Born) into the moment that is Forever - 
To breath until that fateful day
Day of Wrath, Day of Burning - All the
world to ashes turning...

2. Evolution (The Grand Design)
[Music: Michael Romeo, Michael Pinnella]
[Lyrics: Michael Romeo, Russel Allen, Jason Rullo]

Born from the light - journey into the
moment, delivered from thought and
sky
He will be one, one with the land -
Lord of wind and the sea and the sands
The one - The bringer of life

"All will bear a part of me - let this
hollow shell set your free to live as one"

Here we are - Children of Sun and Stars
the first to know and to understand
Living by the Law of the Ages
prophets and sages - forging Utopia

Great Ptah - Khnemu - sacred priest of
the Temple of Ra and the keeper of
truth
Crystalline spheres, the power of light,
grant us keys to the stars and the
secrets of flight
'Five shall be as One'

"We unlock the mysteries of
knowledge and technology"

Here we are - Children of Sun and Stars
the first to know and to understand
Living by the Law of the Ages
prophets and sages - forging Utopia

'We shall live forever, and cast out
those less divine
Gods we will be - rulers of the sea - in
our Grand design'

Here we are - Children of Sun and Stars
the first to know and to understand
Living by the Law of the Ages
prophets and sages - forging Utopia

"...and to create entirely new beings was an even greater
display of thier power, but in attempting to merge thier
energies, some of the newly made beings were
disfigured...and there were altered creatures with wings,
hooved legs and tails - part human, part beast.
And they became divided..."

3. Fallen
[Music: Michael Romeo, Michael Pinnella, Michael Lepond, Jason Rullo]
[Lyrics: Russel Allen, Jason Rullo]

Alone I walk, among the twisting
shadows
tempted by the ancient magic, the Power
of Five
My desire to mirror my own image -
and I will offer you no soul - offer you no
soul

Tonight Darkness will shadow the Light -
Symmetry divine, there's no force greater
Dividing the Fathers of Time

Feel my hate, I'm banished to this
wasteland
my Serpents plot the overthrow of your
temples and shrines
In the night, my army's rage and fury
burning my
shadow into the land - Vengeance by my
hand

Tonight Darkness will shadow the Light -
Symmetry divine, there's no force greater
Dividing the Fathers of Time
Tonight Darkness will shadow the Light - 
Paradise denied - the balance of ages
forever lost in time

Was I sure of my fateful wish to evoke
the night from the day?
Thousands now join as one - be afraid
What have I done? Clouds are dimming
the Sun with his wrath of disease and
decay
This masque of vengeance leads my
death parade
What have I done?
"My shadow burning - my shadow burns
across the land...".

Tonight Darkness will shadow the Light -
Symmetry divine, there's no force greater
Dividing the Fathers of Time
Tonight Darkness will shadow the Light - 
Paradise denied - the balance of ages
forever lost in time

"...and there was a need for balance, the
coming of Ma'at.."

4. Transcendence (Segue)
[Music: Michael Romeo]

[Instrumental]

5. Communion And The Oracle
[Music: Michael Romeo, Michael Pinnella]
[Lyrics: Michael Romeo, Jason Rullo]

All we know, now has come undone
Balance lost between the Moon and Sun
Hear out prayers - Keepers of the Skies
Divine
Upon us all - let your wisdom shine

Losing faith as the madness prevails
in us all we are searching for a reason,
a need to calm the storm
In our sails - let your winds be strong

Breathe the air around you
The oceans fill your veins and winds
embrace your heart
Feel the change within you
The Sun and Moon align - The Grand
Design awaits a new start

From the skies, looking down on you
Through the clouds tainted crystal blue
"Such advancement, yet lacking the
control,
so unaware of your earthly roles"

Praise this child and the words of her
rhyme
A sacred gift - Magic of the Five will
bring you tranquillity
A new order of equality

Five senses come alive - Five reasons
thrive - Five nations unite - Unite as
one
Night and Day will find a way to keep
the Balance true
Let the Sky and Stars be your guide -
the destination is up to you

Raise our heads up to the Skies
Feel the essence of Time
Changing ways like the shifting tides
In the waves hear the Rhyme

"..unfortunately, not all were interested in the
Ways of Justice, and those of the Night
gathered to plot the elimination of the great
Law of One and the death of Ma'at. The
Atlantens harnessed the energy of the great
Crystals to create a weapon of immense power,
unaware that the power they possessed would
ultimately lead to thier downfall..."

6. The Bird-Serpent War/Cataclysm
[Music: Michael Romeo, Michael Pinnela]
[Lyrics: Michael Romeo, Michael Pinnella]

Mocking the ways of Justice - the
Serpent's Dragon - Vultures ride
Storming the Gates of Seven - no mortal
man shall break our stride
Our flames engulf your good works and
our terror reigns supreme
Dark beasts that do my bidding by
thrashing, tearing down your dreams

"Gather 'round chosen people of the
Grand Design
Scorn the prophet's words - 'the device
of our demise'..."

The crumbling earth beneath the
weapon's roar -
Raining fire from shore to shore
Neptune's might - the storming waves
rise to make the Kingdom's grave

And all Atlantis cried - a million souls
crying out
Save the child from the Sea - she must
carry on
The secrets and technology shrouded
deep in mystery -
only One will carry on - Carry on...

"...the perservation of Balance was utmost
importance, and cast into the sea was the
child Ma'at, to find a new land...riding on the
breath of Poseidon..."

7. On The Breath Of Poseidon (Segue)
[Music: Michael Romeo]

[Instrumental]

8. Egypt
[Music: Michael Romeo, Michael Pinnella, Michael Lepond]
[Lyrics: Michael Romeo, Russel Allen, Jason Rullo]

Endless sands of Alnantees - etched in
gold, a city lost in time
and from the Sea - A Child speaks of
things unseen,
before the King - a teller of the Rhyme

Five align - hidden in the word a
message locked in time
find the Key - it draws the final line
between what is and what should never
be

Gaze in these eyes my child and see -
here by my side, you're destined to be
Fears in the night flee with the Sun - if
we are One
Kingdom of Gold I lay at your feet -
Ruler of Time and Space you will be
Rivers of Truth forever will run - if we
are One

From the ruins of Atlantis, the Lord of
Night rises from the sands
He seeks the one - his serpent's tail and
twisted tongue -
a bringer of War - Destroyer of the land

Five align - hidden in the word a
message locked in time
find the Key - it draws the final line
between what is and what should never
be

"Rise my minions - from within the deep
abyss
my disciples - thunder this necropolis"

Gaze in these eyes my child and see -
here by my side, you're destined to be
Fears in the night chasin the Sun - now
we are One
Kingdom of Gold now lay at my feet -
Ruler of Time and Space I will be
Rivers of Lies forever will run - now we
are One

9. The Death Of Balance/Lacrymosa
[Music: Michael Romeo, Jason Rullo]

Lacrimosa dies illa,
qua resurget ex favilla
judicandus homo reus

"..tainted memories of Balance lost, forever
bury the truth of all unity..."

10. Absence Of Light
[Music: Michael Romeo, Michael Pinnella]
[Lyrics: Michael Romeo, Russel Allen]

Now at my feet, the dying voice of
Balance - nevermore shall there be a
way to fly,
a way to fly on wings of Divinity, as
words of wisdom fade away

The Law of One will fade and die
The rising Moon will crush the Sky

So falls the Night - the darkest hour
Seek and find all the secrets left for you
Absence of Light - unbalanced power
Only then will you know

The hidden words - a piece of the
puzzle - Time will tell what will be
Between the lines, the past and future
you will find - the ones and zeros are
the key
to unlock what's sealed

The Law of One will fade and die
The rising Moon will crush the Sky

So falls the Night - the darkest hour
Justice lost - a travesty we must undo
Absence of Light - unbalanced power
Only then will you know

"Awaken all from Set - Amentet -
Worship all that I represent"

So falls the Night - the darkest hour
Destruction, death and war are in the
air
Absence of Light - unbalanced power
ruling all that we know

So falls the Night - the darkest hour
Unbound - what once was lost - now is
found
Absence of Light - unbalanced power
Only then will we know

"...curse the fools who look for enswers in a
Rhyme,...I am the future, I am Montu -
Sekhmet"

11. A Fool's Paradise
[Music: Michael Romeo, Michael Pinnella]
[Lyrics: Russel Allen, Michael Pinnella]

What's become of the world - the colors unfurl revealing a blackened haze
Conditioned to fear the voice that we hear - calling an end of days
Millions of souls under control like pawns to a king, led by a string, to the final hour

Oh - Empire of the Sea,
Lords of technology that fell into the void
Oh shall it be as it was before - a tragedy on every shore?

Is this the end of all we know - innocence lost so long ago
Woven in dreams - the darkest of schemes now takes hold of our destiny
Decades of greed, plague, famine and war - we can't go on like this anymore
living like fools - chaos will rule this eternal paradise

Death by design, altering birth - trends of the modern age
The wisdom of life erased from the Earth - in a reckless rampage

Oh - Empire of the Sea,
Lords of technology bring death unto the earth
Oh shall it be as it was before - a tragedy on every shore?

Is this the end of all we know - innocence lost so long ago
Woven in dreams - the darkest of schemes now takes hold of our destiny
Decades of greed, plague, famine and war - we can't go on like this anymore
living like fools - chaos will rule this eternal paradise

Dies Irae,
Dies Illa,
Solvet Saeclum in favilla

Decades of greed, plague, famine and war - we can't go on like this anymore
Living like fools - chaos will rule this eternal paradise

Is this the end of all we know - innocence lost so long ago
Woven in dreams - the darkest of schemes now takes hold of our destiny
Decades of greed, plague, famine and war - we can't go on like this anymore
Lost in the night - fading from sight - is this the final setting sun?

12. Rediscovery (Segue)
[Music: Michael Romeo, Michael Pinnella]

[Instrumental]

"...and on the Eye of Alignment the everlasting
battle of Darkness and Light descends to
another plane, but, on this material Earth, we
must look to a crime remembered only by a
collective resonance in the human
consciousness...
when Five where as One..."

13. Rediscovery (Part II) - The New Mythology
[Music: Michael Romeo, Michael Pinnella, Jason Rullo]
[Lyrics: Michael Romeo, Michael Pinnella, Russel Allen]

A voice from the past echoes the fate -
a tale of all things yet to come
as it once was, so it shall be again
modern day Children of the Sun

Seek the hidden rhyme and there you'll find
a new world order
Feel the mystery - so much to see through the
eyes of hope

The Thoughts of Ma'at, forever secured -
locked in the Ages
Goddess of Truth speaks eternally
from the depths of the pages

Seek the hidden words - as time unfolds
you'll find the answers
Feel the mystery - look to the Sea, under
Skies of Hope

What have we done? Can we right all the
wrongs - the evils and fears, for thousands of
years, that forever drain our vitality?
Can this go on without dyer consequence?
Our tragic ways, the end of days that shadow
the dawn of eternity...

He's taken form in human - likeness
and manifests himself in all our darkest
dreams
Preying upon centuries of weakness
Feasting on despair and our own selfish
greed

Bow down to me - (we will never understand)
Then take my hand and you will see - (we'll see...)
you will see paradise - (a paradise?) - of
pain and death
awaiting for you all - (we'll decide the future)

Lost evermore the essence of truth, although
she tried in vein to bring us peace, it will
ever rest in our hands
We've cried a thousand tears for all we had,
and all the things we could have been,
we must find our way again

Fools who looks for answers in a rhyme,
seeking out a lie, an illusion
I am the future, the ageless mutation

Five beyond the skies align, Zeus to Ra - the
final sign

My opposition's drawing near, feeding on his
fear - tasting anguish
I have the power - the ageless invasion

Five beyond the skies align, Zeus to Ra - the
final sign
From the Messenger on Wings, Peace and
War - a line of Kings...

Again the Titans clash on the edge of this
earthen plane
Now from the depths they speak - echoing
from the wave
- From the Waves...

"Choose the way, five paths there for you to find
turn the page, the question lies between the lines can
we change?"

14. Masquerade '98
[japanese bonus track]

Shackled in darkness
The forbidden portrait confined to its frame
Unbroken silence
A total misfortune and shame

Raging obsession
This mask of opression
It hides your aggression from view
This tearing suture
Renounces the love he once knew

You sacrifice this paradise of innocence
Trust the lie - you falsify the line of truth
You disguise your insolence
Don't deny insanity - mediocrity

Save us from this masquerade of lies
Kings and fools die in ridicule (save us)
Save us from this masquerade of lies

A fallen fortress sees him beneath starless skies
Subsiding deeper - the final farewell in his eyes

Unspoken hero
Distrust and thrusted within surmise
Seizing intrusion to unveil his clever disguise

You sacrifice this paradise of innocence
Trust the lie - you falsify the line of truth

Save us from this masquerade of lies
Kings and fools die in ridicule (save us)
Save us from this masquerade of lies

[Solo]

Save us from this masquerade of lies
Kings and fools die in ridicule (save us)
Save us from this masquerade of lies

1. Overture
[Instrumental]
2. Nevermore
From the skies, across the sea of lies
To the dungeons of the damned
Scorching winds blazing thunderclouds raging
Here I make my stand

The viper's venomous bite
Has brought on the night
Swept away, like a bird of prey
Now there's hell to pay

From darkness into light
Nothing matters anymore
My strings ring hollow
Bleeding evermore

Nevermore
Can't let go
Your silences tells me
All I need to know
Nevermore
Strike a chord
The walls of silence fall
Nevermore

Kings of death calling
Frigid breath falling
In the cryptic den
Curse the dark with a
Longing heart and song
You will rise again

On tragic wings I take flight
Bring on the night
Eyes of stone ripping flesh from bone
Into depths unknown

From darkness into light
Nothing matters anymore
My strings ring hollow
Bleeding evermore

Nevermore
Can't let go
Your silences tells me
All I need to know
Nevermore
Strike a chord
The walls of silence fall
Nevermore

Lost in shadows of what might have been
Bloodless spirits wept in fear
The void of anguish slowly pulls me in
"Abandon hope all who enter here"

Nevermore
Can't let go
Your silences tells me
All I need to know
Nevermore
Strike a chord
The walls of silence fall
Nevermore
Nevermore
Nevermore

3. Underworld
Treacherous words rise from the mist
From envious eyes and poisonous cold, pale lips
Gluttons of pleasure - Gluttons of pain
Vengeance by sevens - My sweet cursed children of Cain

Thrashing and clashing with specters
Hiding from the light - demons of death
Chaos and anguish perfector
Stealing their last dying breath

Driven by greed, slave to addiction
A massive decay of a most foul contradiction
Spirits of lust piercing the air
Writhing with sins of the flesh etched deep in their stare

Descend the abyss ever faster
Hidden from light - demons of death
Cursing the black-winged master
With their last dying breath

Soar through the flame
I call your name
Wrath and might get me through this night
Can I make it right? Or will you remain?

I´ve finally realized, that long after laughter dies
I can't undo the things I've done - oh, the things I´ve done...
When will my dark skies disappear - I long to see the sun

Soar through the flame
I call your name
Wrath and might - get me through this night
Can I make it right? Or will you remain... in hell ?

4. Without You
Flying into the storm
Hanging on a broken wing
Onto every life
A little rain must fall

Oh, the words I sing
It's a greater thing
To have loved and lost
Than to never, ever
Loved at all

I've come undone
Any fool can see
What's become of me

Sometimes I feel
Feels like there's nothing there
Just an empty stare
Sometimes I feel
Feels like with each passing day
Life just slips away
Without you

Drifting on the sea
A lonely ship without a sail
Sinking like a stone
Drowning in despair
Fighting tooth and nail
Mind the siren's wail
And here comes the night
But the moment's gone without a warning
Or without a prayer

I've come undone
Fearing things unseen
Can I mend this broken dream?

Sometimes I feel
Feels like there's nothing there
Just an empty stare
Sometimes I feel
Feels like with each passing day
Life just slips away
Without you

The days slowly disappear
Time to face my fears
What will be will be
I can't escape
I can't escape my...
My destiny

Sometimes I feel
Feels like there's nothing there
Just an empty stare
Sometimes I feel
Feels like with each passing day
Life just slips away
Without you

5. Kiss Of Fire
Realms of desolation - where phantoms frighten beasts
Through fiery rain, the screams of pain, eternal, never cease

Hell's abomination - boundless chains of woe
With mighty stride, the horsemen ride in a sable blackened glow

Into night - into fury
Horse of crimson she rides
Blinding light - kiss of fire
From the depths, arise

Wasteland of confusion - where nothing's as it seems
Beneath the skies, the daylight dies
Destroyer of all dreams

Bringer of misfortune - monarch's great abyss
And by his side - the queen of lies - unleashes fury's kiss

Into night - into fury
Horse of crimson she rides
Blinding light - kiss of fire
From the depths, arise

Feels like the sky is falling
My demons calling my name
From the other side
I'm being buried - feels like I'm buried, buried alive!

Bring down the hammer with furious anger
It´s me against the world
Bring down my fists with flaming malice
It´s me against the world

Into night - into fury
Horse of crimson she rides
Blinding light - kiss of fire
From the depths, arise

6. Charon
Through me you pass - just take my hand
The ferryman whispers my name
The course has been set - lord of the damned
To the banks, over river of pain

We rise and fall - with the tide
On through the gates, where shadows await
See the glimmer of gold in his eye

"The bridges have been burned - never to return"

Sail away - on the winds of Charon
Take me to the distant shore
Lead the way - on winds of Charon
By the Gods, I can't ignore
The sight of his face - shrouded in death's cold embrace

Through me you pass - to the lacrymose plains
Though my passage comes with a price
A sky without stars is all that remains
To the shores made of fire and ice

We rise and fall - with the tide
Just say the word - cause there's no return
To the coast where the true power lies

"The bridges have been burned - never to return"

[2x]
Sail away - on the winds of Charon
Take me to the distant shore
Lead the way - on winds of Charon
By the Gods, I can't ignore
The sight of his face - shrouded in death's cold embrace

7. Hell And Back
I have led the lamb into the slaughter
Ice flowed through my veins
I was my own worst enemy, still hellish memories remain.

I have shown the serpent into the garden
And wore the Mark of Cain.
Take a look in these eyes, where the past evil lies –
And feel my pain.

Oh – the hell's hounds drawing near
…And my conscience isn’t clear

I’m the one who whispered the words to Judas,
I’m the hangman’s noose.
Though I try to repent, in a valiant attempt –
It’s no use

I’m the judge, the jury, the executioner
Oh, the things I’ve seen
With an eye for an eye, kill the man, kill the past, kill the dream.

Oh – the hell's hounds drawing near
…And my conscience isn’t clear

I’ve been to hell and back…
And I can’t justify believing the lie, I slowly fade to black
Learning to live and die – I’m learning to fly.

Under the moonlit glow – I just can’t let it go
Words spoke in vain, now fall like a silent tear.
As shades dance by candlelight – in the dead of night
And all of the things I yearn slowly disappear
And now there’s nothing here…

Riding the storm, heading for a fall
I curse you all – be damned.
Through the haze, the sword that cuts both ways
A line is drawn in the sand.

Ironbound – a will as cold as steel,
To conquer all and divide
Striking with an iron fist of will
I will not be denied.

On and on and on…No quarter asked, no quarter given.
On and on and on…Never forgotten or forgiven.

Thunders rise from the terror’s eyes
Scorched by a heart drenched in black.
No return, I will watch it burn
Now there’s no turning back.

On and on and on…No quarter asked, no quarter given.
On and on and on…Never forgotten or forgiven.

I’ve been to hell and back…
And I can’t justify believing the lie, I slowly fade to black
Learning to live and die – I’m learning to fly.

8. In My Darkest Hour
I’ve been betrayed
By the angel of death
And the serpent who stole her last breath.

Feeding the flame
Though I pray for the best,
I prepare for the worst, just the same.

Dominator – Subjugator
Locked in an apocalypse gaze
Desecrator – Devastator
Set my world ablaze

In my darkest hour – with “thy kingdom’s power”
Hear my song and hear my plea
Put the pieces back together – nothing lasts forever
May darkest hour – let it be…

Grant my request
Darksome master of pain
Incarnation of all that’s profane.

Without a prayer
Under six black wing’s flutter
And six mouths of screaming despair.

Born a Liar – Falsifier
Trapped in this damned infernal maze
Crucifier – born of fire
Set my world ablaze

In my darkest hour – with “thy kingdom’s power”
Hear my song and hear my plea
Put the pieces back together – nothing lasts forever
May darkest hour – let it be…

In my darkest hour – with “thy kingdom’s power”
Hear my song and hear my plea
Put the pieces back together – nothing lasts forever
May darkest hour – let it be…

9. Run With The Devil
I’m on the run, nowhere to turn, they’re on my heels
Lost in the maze, where do I go?
Am I insane, it’s just a game of life and death
Stay the course and ride the flow.

I cross the bridge, I’m at the gates
I’m out of breath, chasing the clock, I’m out of time.
I hear the dogs, I feel the claws rake down my back
There’s no escape, no peace of mind

Oh – Just hold on
Oh – Just hold on
I’m on my way to you…

Run with the devil – run for your life
The truth of the moment, it cuts like a knife
Chasing a shadow – still chasing a dream.
When it’s ‘do or die’, you know there’s no in between…

I see the fiends, they’re on the move, they strike with fear
Give them the slip, I duck the blade
I knuckle-down, I roll the dice, I dance with death
Lost in the realm of light and shade.

My path is weak, it falls away, I feel the heat
The fires of hell beneath me rise.
Caught in a trap, there’s no way out, walls closing in
Is this the hour of my demise?

Oh – Just hold on
Oh – Just hold on
I’m on my way to you…

Run with the devil – run for your life
The truth of the moment, it cuts like a knife
Chasing a shadow – still chasing a dream.
When it’s ‘do or die’, you know there’s no in between…

I’ve searched the depths of hell to find the key
I’ve wasted time – now time has wasted me…

Run with the devil – run for your life
The truth of the moment, it cuts like a knife
Chasing a shadow – still chasing a dream.
When it’s ‘do or die’, you know there’s no in between…

10. Swansong
I stand alone
As my world comes crashing down
Some things are never meant to be
Accept your fate cause there's no second-time around
"It´s not the stars or sky that shapes our destiny"

Just a fateful glance
Just a fleeting chance in the wind
Gone forevermore

Hear my song, carry on
Through the lost and lonely air
Still I sing, can it bring
All the things that I desire?
With you, I wouldn't change a thing
Just for you, I'd do most anything
But now you´re gone
And my swan song echoes on

I walk alone, like a stranger in this town
Is it best to fail or never try at all?
I face the shadows, as the sun is sinking down
"Some rise by sin - and some by virtue fall"

Just a fateful glance
Just a fleeting chance in the wind
Gone forevermore

Hear my song, carry on
Through the lost and lonely air
Still I sing, can it bring
All the things that I desire?
With you, I wouldn't change a thing
Just for you, I'd do most anything
But now you´re gone
And my swan song echoes on

Goddess of shadowy play
Whose boundless power, divides the night from the day
Plains of woe, eclipsed from all sight
And wrapped forever in the darkest depths of night

Hear my song, carry on
Through the lost and lonely air
Still I sing, can it bring
All the things that I desire?
With you, I wouldn't change a thing
Just for you, I'd do most anything
But now you´re gone
And my swan song echoes on

11. Legend
Steal away through the land of the dead –
Where angels fear to tread
Over mountains, the sky, and the sea.

Feel the light bleeding from a new moon –
Escape from the hands of doom
I never thought I could change what would be.

Break the chains of fear
I won’t shed another tear

The rise and fall
Although I fight like hell, there’s just no certainty.
My battlefield lay scarred with empty victories.
Running from the past, from a lifetime of lies.
But the legend never dies…

Here comes the horror, here comes the pain –
Flying too close to the flame
Into darkness, now falling from grace.

From the nine realms of woe, I arise –
Vindication in my eyes
Lines of tragedy carved deep on my face.

Break the chains of fear
Now it all seems crystal clear…

The rise and fall
Although I fight like hell, there’s just no certainty.
My battlefield lay scarred with empty victories.
Running from the past, from a lifetime of lies.
But the legend never dies…

The rise and fall
Although I fight like hell, there’s just no certainty.
My battlefield lay scarred with empty victories.
Running from the past, from a lifetime of lies.
But the legend never dies…

The legend never dies…

1. Iconoclast
Rise of the one -
The dark iconoclast
Forging a cult of fear,
With legions unsurpassed
Shouting the word -
With vicious tongues of fire
Born of illusion and deceit
Fiendish soul of a liar.

The chaos unseen rips
The midnight sky
Infernal machines arise
Flesh and steel collide

[Chorus:]
We are strong
We will stand and fight
We are strong
We will stand and fight

With rage we ride into the flames
Striking with spears of hate,
At the heart where evil reigns
Holding the line from the charge
Of armored steeds
Gather around this deadly ground,
Come watch the war god bleed.

The chaos unseen rips
The midnight sky
Infernal machines arise
Flesh and steel collide

We are strong
We will stand and fight
We are strong
We will stand and fight

Victory or death, only time will tell
Synthetic resurrection,
From the heart of hell
Slowly they fall, as we watch
The daylight die
We spit and curse this hallowed earth
With our final battle cry,

The chaos unseen rips
The midnight sky
Infernal machines arise -
Flesh and steel collide

We are strong
We will stand and fight
We are strong
We will stand and fight

2. The End Of Innocence
Bite your tongue
The blackened sun
Will curse the moon
Skies of fire
Nothing's worth a damn

Calculate
Anticipate
Your every move
Beware
The ruthless hearts of man

Feel my pain
My words are in vain
I believe it's the end of innocence
Don't look away
Oh, hear what I say
I believe it's the end of innocence

Cut and splice
a fierce device
Degenerate
Sons of light
Synthetic gods, our man

Crushed beneath
The dragon beast
Breathing hate
Your blood
Your blood is on their hands

Feel my pain
My words are in vain
I believe it's the end of innocence
Don't look away
Oh, hear what I say
I believe it's the end of innocence

The world is dying
The precious sands of time
Are running out

We are the fallen
Made obsolete
Methodically phased out
...Feel my pain

Feel my pain
My words are in vain
I believe it's the end of innocence
Don't look away
Oh, hear what I say
I believe it's the end of innocence

3. Dehumanized
Tap the vein - Inject my brain
And let the poison flow
Torn apart - You’re ripping out my heart
It's painless, let it go

Come on, hit the switch - You son of a bitch
I'm devoured, broke in two
You take control and resurrect my soul
Becoming something new...

What's done is done - I'm dead inside
I'm what you've all become - Mindless and mesmerized

Dehumanized
I'm dehumanized
Don't you realize - I'm Dehumanized
Oh, and victimized
You can't break me
You unmake me - Dehumanized

Ripped to shreds - the venom spreads
Release the system plague
Shed your skin - electrified within
Complete the final stage

I will break my shell and unleash hell
There's nothing you can do
Just a cut above - This sacred new blood
Becoming something new...

What's done is done - I'm dead inside
I'm what you've all become - Mindless and mesmerized

Dehumanized
I'm dehumanized
Don't you realize - I'm Dehumanized
Oh, and victimized
You can't break me
You unmake me - Dehumanized

Is this life worth the question why?
Or is this life just a lie?
'Cause my eyes are cold and numb
And I don't know what the hell I've become...

Dehumanized
I'm dehumanized
Don't you realize - we're all Dehumanized
Enslaved and victimized
You can't break us,
No, you can't unmake us
We have all become – Dehumanized

4. Bastards Of The Machine
You can be all you desire
An honest man - a vicious liar
Seek out the Light or seek the Dark

You can honor or desecrate
Sympathize or manipulate
Carved in your flesh - embrace the Mark

Enslaved and hypnotized -
Chained to artificial lives
You are the Bastards of the Machine
The Bastards of the Machine

Be a saint for those in need
Or spin them webs of lust and greed,
Yeah, you've restored my dying faith

With a kiss of death - a last farewell
Hand in hand, through the Gates of Hell
You'll pay the price for the choice you make

I see your demons rise -
Deep within your burning eyes
You are the Bastards of the Machine
The Bastards of the Machine

The Bastards of the Machine
The Bastards of the Machine

5. Heretic
The human infection
Soaring on winds of woe and pestilence
Remove imperfection -
Parasites with lives of little consequence,

Even though we know the sky is falling
Still we choose not to believe,
On your knees...

Heretic - devil in disguise
Never quit - tearing down the walls, brick by brick
Feeding on the lies - Heretic
Counterfeit's the kingdom you devise

The flesh breeds corruption -
Irradicate the insect prey, exterminate
Crawl with the Leeches - you cry
Shattered to pieces - you die
Here I stand - god of man - the Perfect Beast

Even though we know the sky is falling
Still we choose not to believe
On your knees...

Heretic - devil in disguise
Never quit - tearing down the walls, brick by brick
Feeding on the lies - Heretic
Counterfeit's the kingdom you devise

Oh, burn!
Watch me burn - Live and learn
As the night surrounds me
No escape, no where to hide

Feel the sting of severing
Become one with Darkness
No escape, I'm dead inside

Heretic - devil in disguise
Never quit - tearing down the walls
Brick by brick
Feeding on the lies - Heretic
Counterfeit's the kingdom you devise

6. Children Of A Faceless God
Screaming at the walls around me -
Broken and alone
Fighting with my inner demons is all I've ever known

All I am - I give to you
All my dreams and nightmares, too

Disconnected life of anguish -
The mirror fades to black
Feels like I'm sinking deep into illusion.
No one's staring back

Somewhere unseen - there's something between
Is it the truth or a lie...

Can't you see - You and me
We're Children of a Faceless God
Misery is our destiny
We're Children of a Faceless God

Just another faceless shadow - I'm desensitized
And I don't feel the pain, am I insane?
My nightmare's realized

Somewhere unseen - there's something between
Is it the truth or a lie...

Can't you see - You and me
We're Children of a Faceless God
Misery is our destiny
We're Children of a Faceless God

All I have - I give to you
All my dreams, my nightmares, too

Wretched promenade - watch the freak parade
Celebrate the suffering and affliction

Laugh at tragedy - worship sin with me
Let us share in selfish addiction

Spitting on the shrine - drink the poison wine
Leave a life in ruins - tattered and torn

Completely interfaced to a God without a Face
In his image of darkness...  I'm reborn

Can't you see - You and me
We're Children of a Faceless God
Misery is our destiny
We're Children of a Faceless God

7. When All Is Lost
I believe...  Nothing ever comes to light -
Chasing shadows in the night
In a starless sky and I wonder why

I believe... We will never find a way -
That darkness lights the day
We never question why, still I wonder why?

I close my eyes lost in a memory
Just like a candle in the wind
What could have been, with just one kiss goodbye
You spread your wings to fly
Far away, somehow, someday you will understand
I hope you'll understand... someday

Silent pictures speak like ghosts in the machine
Haunting my reflection in the frame
Chasing down the hopeful child inside of me
Where'd it all go wrong and who's to blame

We pass the time away
With empty lives, the laughter dies

Is this all we have to show?
Is this all they'll ever know?  Can they find their way?
What went wrong?  Where have all the heroes gone?
Trading futures for a song we gave away

Thinking only of myself, I forged ahead
No regrets, no apologies
Bitter tears reward the life that I have led
A world of lies brings me to my knees

I took the road with every twist and every turn
The words of wisdom is the lesson never learned
Lose your fear and free your soul or
The mysteries of life you'll truly never know
You’ll never know

Is this all we have to show?
Is this all they'll ever know?  Can they find their way?
What went wrong?  Where have all the heroes gone?
Trading futures for a song we gave away
Just gave it away…

I close my eyes, lost in that memory
Like a candle in the wind
What could have been, with just one kiss goodbye
You spread your wings to fly far away
I hope you'll understand one day

We pass the time away
With empty lives the laughter dies
And the colors fade – fade away

Is this all we have to show?
Is this all they'll ever know?  Can they find their way?
What went wrong?  Where have all the heroes gone?
Trading futures for a song we gave away

What went wrong?
Where have all our heroes gone?
Trade our future for a song,
We gave it all away...

8. Electric Messiah
You liberate me, separate and set me free
You release my spirit to the wind
For evermore your name will soar inside of me
Let the reign of steel begin

Oh, how the prophets of the people were so blind
As one by one, all the kingdoms fall in line

Hail the Night - the Bringer of Light
My Electric Messiah
Come and be transformed - unmade and reborn
Set your soul on fire

All will believe, you won't deceive in any way
Endless empty minds at your command

I'll never fail, I'll drive the nail in all the way
Right into your heart with dying hands

Oh, how the prophets of the people were so blind
As one by one, all the kingdoms fall in line
Oh, so blind…

Hail the Night - the Bringer of Light
My Electric Messiah
Come and be transformed - unmade and reborn
Set your soul on fire

Hail the Night - the Bringer of Light
My Electric Messiah
Come and be transformed - unmade and reborn
Set your soul, your souls on fire

Hail the Night
Oh, oh Hail the Bringer of Light
I am reborn, I am transformed

9. Prometheus (I Am Alive)
Perfection - one direction
One voice, one mind
Selection - mass dissection
Rebuild, refine

Creation - modification
Becoming something more
Mutations - bred to infect
Erase, restore

You made me strong, but you don't fear me
No right or wrong, if you believe set me free
Feel the power inside of me...

Alive, Alive - Rising up I am Alive
I am the Dark - I am the Light
Alive, Alive - Rising up I am Alive
Within you I'm Alive

Undying - no denying
Predict, engage, remove
Destroyer - soul exploiter
Delete, design, improve

Invasion - mass domination
Becoming something more
One nation born to accept
Embrace, endure

You made me strong, yet you don't fear me
No right or wrong, if you believe set me free
Feel the power inside of me...

Alive, Alive - Rising up I am Alive
I am the Dark - I am the Light
Alive, Alive - Rising up I am Alive
Within you I'm Alive

Alive, Alive - Rising up I am Alive
I am the Dark - I am the Light
Alive, Alive - Rising up I am Alive
Within you I'm Alive

Rising up I am Alive
Forever I will live a lie

10. Light Up The Night
Have you lost all your senses?
Oh, why did you have to go tempting fate?
Blinded by your ambitions
Oh, why can't you see the chaos you create?

Oh, have we gone too far, too fast?

My dying eyes scream with pain
All my hopes and my dreams drown in flames
And all the lies shine so bright
All the souls of the world light up the night

You're a slave to desire
For lust of profit you consume my soul
Do you think you can make it stop?
Oh no - it's too late to turn, you've lost control.

Oh, have we gone too far, too fast?

My dying eyes scream with pain
All my hopes and my dreams drown in flames
And all the lies shine so bright
All the souls of the world light up the night

Pushing the boundaries
Reinvent a new reality
Changing evolution
Ignoring the past
As we realize our destructive destiny

Come on!
I want to see you drown in flames.

My dying eyes scream with pain
All my hopes and my dreams drown in flames
And all the lies shine so bright
All the souls of the world light up the night

11. The Lords Of Chaos
Forged in blood, carved in stone,
Right before your eyes, you’ve always known
See the truth inside yourself, see the world like no one else
Oh, if only you were king, you could change everything.

Can’t you see what they’re doing to you and me?

We rule, we fly
Above the lights of the neon sky
We fight, we cry
The Lords of Chaos will never die

All you see must be destroyed
Your destiny you can’t avoid
Show them all your demon sign
Tell them all to get in line
There’s no time to waste
Its poison but they can’t taste it.

Don’t you see what they’re doing to you and me?

We rule, we fly
Above the lights of the neon sky
We fight and we cry
The Lords of Chaos will never die
Will never die.

The quick and the dead
Moving fast they’re in your head
Infection spreads in the blood of the damned

The truth and the lies
It’s all the same, it’s just a game
You see, day and night you hold them in your hands, oh…

Oh, can’t you see what they’re doing to you and me?

We rule, we fly
Above the lights of the neon sky
We fight and we cry
The Lords of Chaos will never die

We rule, we fly
Above the lights of the neon sky, oh…
We fight, we cry
The Lords of Chaos will never ever die

12. Reign In Madness
Scorn the omen - architects of deceit
Pulverized within the jaws of defeat
Our ruin engineered, we’ve reached the gates of fear

Forging vengeance in the city of doom
Ripping death from sin’s unholy womb
The riders on the storm, cursed the day they’re born
We were warned...

Strike them down - strike with power
Kill them all from shore to shore
We destroy - we devour
We command the vicious dogs of war

Treads of iron crush the skulls of the damned
Stench of burning flesh covers the land
Rising from the screams - a godless war machine

Execution - fire scorches the sky
Crimson horsemen runs with genocide
As the seas turn red, We raise the living dead
Or so it's said...

Strike them down, strike with power
Kill them all from shore to shore
We destroy - we devour
We command the vicious dogs of war

[Chorus:]
Bow your heads and abandon hope
We’re the gods of pain
Raise your hands if you’ll join with us
And let the madness reign

Forsaken and forgotten
Condemned - hopeless and alone
The sickened and the rotten
Infect everything you’ve ever known

War hammer of disaster
Crushing every living head
Surrender to the masters
The brainwashed electric living dead

There’s no escaping
The more I learn, the less I know.
I must be crazy
I’m giving in, I’m letting go

If all the world’s a stage,
It’s just a masquerade of crazies
Hit the lights and start the show...

[Repeat chorus]

1. Oculus Ex Inferni
[Instrumental]

2. Set The World On Fire (The Lie Of Lies)
[Music: Romeo, Lyrics: Allen, Romeo]

God-like perfection
reflect in these eyes
reaching for my place - With stars on high

Damn the betrayers
Through twilight, I fall
Headlong flaming - I curse you all

There's no turning back
falling deep into the sweet collapsing black

[CHORUS:]
Fly with me - forever higher
And with these wings,
We'll Set the World on Fire
Fly with me - through scorching skies
You and I - The Lie of Lies

I'm the Master of Illusion
Minister of sin
Two - faced snake - wicked - shedding skin

I will forsake you
Destroy and unmake you
With all my might, I will take you down

There's no turning back
Falling deep into the sweet collapsing black

Fly with me - forever higher
And with these wings,
We'll Set the World on Fire
Fly with me - through scorching skies
You and I - The Lie of Lies

Don't leave me - you need me
only I know the way...

[CHORUS]

3. Domination
All along the waste and wild
legions of lost scream in pain
A million shattered destinies
all slowly drowning in tears of flame

Break the chains around your necks
lick your wounds you Dogs of War
Raise your banners ever high
and ravage the Babylon Whore

I, with darkest insurrection, victimize
Hail the horrors, all hail and sanctify
...my Domination

Rotting from the inside out
ripping away to the core
A million lies unite as one
slaughtering innocence for evermore

Sound the mighty drums of doom
march to this black heart of fate
Clawing, tearing, slashing deep
defiantly fighting our fate

I, with darkest insurrection, victimize
Hail the horrors, all hail and sanctify
...my Domination

Turn the waters red with rage
burn all the earth shore to shore
Open wide the Gates of Hell
defile the Babylon Whore

I, with darkest insurrection, victimize
Hail the horrors, all hail and sanctify
...my Domination
...my Domination

4. The Serpent's Kiss
Covenant of pure corruption
sink my teeth deep into you
Solemn oath of sheer destruction
Nightmare, through and through

In that hour - I'll devour
Hope is swallowed up in Pain
taste the venom - feel the power
coursing through my veins

I'm corruption
I'm destruction, through and through

Trust in me... for I will set you free
with a Serpent's Kiss
with a Serpent's Kiss

Be my lights and I won't stray - make me beg;
make me pray
Tell me when to laugh or cry - when to live
and when to die

Forgotten and betrayed
Rotting and decayed
left to wither - without a voice
left to slither - without a choice

[solo]

Crucifier - spitting fire
say your little empty prayers
This empire - growing higher
To this spite I swear

Sharp tongue severs - like a razor
swimming in a sea of rage
Vindicators - masqueraders
all the world's my stage

I devour
I empower - god of pain

Trust in me... for I will set you free
with a Serpent's Kiss
How could it come to this?
with a Serpent's Kiss

5. Paradise Lost
In the cold misty morning
gleaming rays awake the dawn
Here I stand - a stranger in this land
does your conscience betray you?
falling from grace -
feel the sun on my face
does desire still hold true?

Mystified by her beauty -
does the hunter pity his prey?
Under starless skies all
Love must die and fade away

Take my hand - divine or damned
Make a stand, seize the day
Yours or mine, damned of divine
Draw the line, come what may...

Looking down from ethereal skies
Silent crystalline tears I cry
For all must say their last goodbye -
to Paradise

My yearning is silenced by angelic skin of white
Love conquers all for heaven's fall
this faithful night.
Yours or mine - damned of divine
Draw the line - serpentine...

Love is a tragedy
all that I have, all that I'll ever need
is right here inside
Let the winds of freedom be my guide

Looking down from Ethereal Skies
Silent crystalline tears I cry
For all must say their last goodbye -
to Paradise

Looking down from Ethereal Skies
Silent crystalline tears I cry
For all must say their last goodbye -
to Paradise
Say goodbye, goodbye, hold on!

...so I've cheated and I've lied
been the victim of foolish pride
and I've begged and I've crawled
and I've battled and bled for it all
now I'll savor the downfall...
of Paradise

Looking down from Ethereal Skies
Silent crystalline tears I cry
For all will say their last goodbye
to Paradise

6. Eve Of Seduction
It's alright - no need to question
Taste the night - just close your eyes
it just takes one bite

All you need's in my possession
Just believe - come take my hand, tonight and
trust your dreams

I'm falling all to pieces, slowly losing control

Can it be true?
Why can't you see - I'm Burning for You
There's no disguising my desires - what can I do?
All you will know - give me your heart
give me your soul
I'll tear it apart, so long as you'll never let me go.

On your ear - a whisper, fallen
Show no fear - go spread your wings and fly
shed no tears

Pleasure's pain - I hear it calling
feed the flame - within becoming kin with the
Sons of Cain

I'm falling all to pieces, slowly losing control

Can it be true?
Why can't you see - I'm Burning for You
There's no disguising my desires - what can I do?
All you will know - give me your heart
give me your soul
I'll tear it apart, so long as you'll never let me go.

Can it be true?
Why can't you see - I'm Burning for You
There's no disguising my desires - what can I do?
All you will know - give me your heart
give me your soul
I'll tear it apart, so long as you'll never let me go.

7. The Walls Of Babylon
Down the plains - come Hell Riders
blood of ice and hissing breath
Consumed by this lust - into battle
staring down the Eyes of Death

Skies of Red - Winged Thunder Breathing
Lightning Fire - Invaders - Light slayers
Cut down the fiends and betrayers
Dark destroyers - can't avoid or deny us

War Hammer of the Gods
Bring down the Walls of Babylon

Legions of Lies- beating down the Lamb
Wings of War, they pulverize
Wrath is my name - feel the Hatred
hurling defiance toward the skies

Skies of Red -  Winged Thunder Breathing
Lightning Fire - flesh churning - blood burning
the gears of War, ever turning with conviction
Malediction is King

War Hammer of the Gods
Bring down the Walls of Babylon

So here I stand -  beyond Apocalypse
God of Pain - in lethal stealth
Casualty of Pride - I will never be denied
A Lord of War... at war with Myself

Skies of Red -  Winged Thunder Breathing
Lightning Fire - earth shaking - bones breaking
the Hand of Fate dominating
one by one the Stars are Falling

War Hammer of the Gods
Bring down the Walls of Babylon

8. Seven
Above all - high and mighty - will like a towering
steed - a Web of Conceit that I weave
More...wanting much more - grasping with
Envious Eyes - dark desires lead to words
that cut like knives

Frozen in your tracks... No remorse
Embrace the rack - Twisting down your spine
... 'till the End of Time

It's Fire and Ice - make the Sacrifice
No one there to catch you when you Fall
It's Shadow's and Sin - Enemies Within
You'll be fine, so cross the line and Damn it all

Slip into Shades of Nothing - yesterday's
promises die - More, taking more than I need to
bleed you dry

Cut your throat - Abandon all Hope 'blood-money
lusting' portrayal - Break the trust from dawn
to dusk bring down the curtains on you final
act of betrayal

Empty hands recoil... feel your Blood begin to boil
Tails and Fangs or Doom - violently consumed

It's Fire and Ice - make the Sacrifice
No one there to catch you when you Fall
It's Shadow's and Sin - Enemies Within
You'll be fine, so cross the line and Damn it all

Virtue or vice? Will you pay the price?
When there's no one to catch you when you fall
...so Damn you All...

Give me hot-blooded yearning - infect and pollute
all that's pure - more than my heart can endure
Vengeance and Fury - Screaming
and eye for an eye - lashing out in Anger
I curse the sky

Demon Song is sung - first your ear ... and then
your tongue - Wear this Mask of Fire - and burn
for all you're desired

It's Fire and Ice - make the Sacrifice
No one there to catch you when you Fall
It's Shadow's and Sin - Enemies Within
You'll be fine, so cross the line and Damn it all

9. The Sacrifice
Your eyes, singing to me sweet lullabies
while you lay there in submission
Forbidden desire
alone in the moonlight hearts afire -
burn away our inhibitions

When the stars lose their fire
And night steals the morning away
Forever and a day
I will stay - I will stay here with you my love

Sacrifice, a heartbeat away from paradise
All my reason's giving way to temptation
Fear and Shame - looking for someone else to blame
We're devoured by these foolish accusation

With every fleeting breath I take
Maybe our love was a mistake
Eternal life - I'd trade it for
One moment beside you...

When the stars lose their fire
And night steals the morning away
Forever and a day

When the stars lose their fire
And night taked the morning away
Forever and a day
I will stay - I will stay here with you my love

10. Revelation (Divus Pennae Ex Tragoedia)
Against the wall - they see you
nowhere to run, nowhere to hide

Heroic Mask - The cracks are showing
a Faceless God to shape the Perfect Lie

Wounds of Hate have pierced so deep
they never die - my revenge is bittersweet

Lost in the night wandering alone
Try as I might to escape the fight
It never lets me go - I've got to find a way
A way to Rise above it All

Savior or the Fool - the mystery
fades into the cruel shade of night

This broken disguise can not comprehend
what was, and will be.... until the very end

Wounds of hate have pierced so deep
they never die - my revenge is bittersweet

Lost in the night wandering alone
Try as I might to escape the fight
It never lets me go - I've got to find a way
A way to Rise above it All

...oh, where the North Wind sleeps -that is when
we'll meet again... oh, where the shadows creep
into Twilight, I'll descend
Good and Evil, it never ends
You're just a means to an end

Lost in the night wandering alone
Try as I might to escape the fight
It never lets me go - I've got to find a way
A way to Rise above it All

Lost in the night wandering alone
Try as I might to escape the fight
It never lets me go - I've got to find a way
A way to Rise above it All

I detest your sanity
You're blinded by the light
Empty eyes of suffering
Get out of my life ...life
Take my hand and ride with me
Into the dark
I am the asexual
Tear out your heart ...heart
...Slow
Frightened by shadows
...You hide away
So weak in mind
...You fade away
Now your mind is dead forever
All left behind
Came to shake my hand again
Bow down and die!
Born to walk alone forever
I shall remain
Suffer now my child and see
I am insane! ...Insane

3. Before The Creation Of Time
[Jan '91]

Before the creation of time
When nothingness was all
And a fiery star's implosion
Caused the universe to fall
Worlds in utter chaos and plague
Were doomed to die at last
Vanished in the blackest void
A recreation of the past
Before the creation of time
When emptyness was all
Utter darkness enlights the way
To the surrounding walls
Journey through what mustn't be seen
To where no life dwells
Wisdom of the first creation
No one shall live to tell
Before the creation of time
When nothingness was all
And a blazing star's implosion
Caused the universe to fall
Memories of a frozen time beyond
There's nothing left to show
A new creation soon to be unleashed
In the shadowed depths below
Goodbye mother earth...

4. For They Shall Be Slain
[Nov '90]

Cursed are the lambs of god
For they shall be bled -
Whiter than the whitest snow
Christ is dead
Ancient lies - time to die
Cursed are the slaves of Islam
For they shall be slain
Religion of the lowest minds
Allah is dead
Ancient lies - time to die
Eternally their eyes shall bleed
For they shall be torn out
Vassals of a blind belief
Ancient dead
Ancient lies - time to die

5. If They Had Eyes (The Watchers Of The Earth)
If they had eyes
All they would have witnessed
Creature from the sea
Neanderthal to be...
Man has conquered athra
And to all the gods he gave birth
Though mountains of the dead
Are the watchers of the earth...
...High above the clouds
...Standing tall in might
...Darkness surrounds
...The mountain side
If they had eyes
All they would have witnessed
Creature from the sea
Evil men to be...

6. The Dark One
[Dec '89]

Stalking through the utter dark
Evil eyes glow in the distance
Prepared for a battle in rage
The end for the cruel adventurer
Blow to side - strike through eye
A battle-axe wields to charge
And separates head from body
Darkest blood flowing free
My eyes are filled with pleasure
Blow to side - strike through eye
A hunt for an ancient treasure
No herbs to restore his life
To die by an orchish arrow
Victorious the olog-hai
Slow you'll die - the dark one smiles

7. Into Glory Ride
[Oct '90]

Once upon
An evil time
Up in the north
Mighty men
Fought and died
By the sword
...Onward into glory ride
Into battle
Sign of the hammer
Be my guide
Standing proud
In victory
Into glory ride
...Onward into glory ride
To Birka we sail
(Birch Island)
And celebrate
Hail Thor
And the fallen
Join with Odin
At slain hall
(Valhalla)
...Onward into glory ride

8. ...And The Laughter Has Died
[Dec '90]

Man of fashions flow - die
Time has come to say - goodbye
We spit on your - grave
Slay all in sight - rage
All their power's gone
A battle we have won
No more trust to them
This is the end
So is the utterdark - revenge
And now the laughter has - died

9. Unleashed
[Music April '90, lyrics Nov '90]

When they bring us holy water
We'll tear 'em down to the core
The cross of weakness burns to ashes
And Jesus Christ is no more
This is the way - we're unleashed
So they named us evil men
Evil minded yes we are
Living proud by the law of nature
By the hammer into war
This is the way - we're unleashed
...Join our side and we'll crush the enemy
When they bring us holy water
We'll tear 'em down to the core
The cross of weakness burns to ashes
And Jesus Christ is no more
Tsirhcitna - he's unleashed
...Beware...

10. Violent Ecstasy
[Feb '90]

I - am my own god and master
No one - will take my soul away
I - will rise in stern invasion
Die - the enemy I slay
Choose side, follow mine - take his fuckin' life
I - will enter no path of decay
Stabbing the dagger in their eye
I - will tear 'em down, for all to see
My revenge of all the false in mind
Choose side, follow mine - take his fuckin' life
I will set it free
Violent ecstasy
I will set it free
Violent ecstasy
I - am my own god and master
No one - will take my soul away
I - will rise in stern invasion
Die - the enemy I slay
Choose side, follow mine - take his fuckin' life

11. Where Life Ends
[July '90]

God of lies,
Slaughter and sacrifice
We spit in his face
And laugh as we die
...Where life ends
Mother Christ -
Your son we crucified
On a path to hell -
We choose to live our lives
...Where life ends
Where is the gate
To heaven of glory bright?
Vanished in the dark,
Where is the promised light?

1. The Final Silence
[Music - Fredrik/Johnny; Lyrics - Johnny]

No more shall we pray for peace
Never ever ask them why
No more shall we stop their visions
Of selfdestructing genocide
Dogs on leads march to war
Go ahead end it all...

Blow up the world
The final silence
Blow up the world
I don't give a damn!

Screams of terror, panic spreads
Bombs are raining from the sky
Bodies burning, all is dead
There's no place left to hide
Dogs on leads march to war
Go ahead end it all...

Blow up the world
The final silence
Blow up the world
I don't give a damn!

(A voice was heard from the battle field)

"Couldn't care less for a last goodbye
For as I die, so do all my enemies
There's no tomorrow, and no more today
So let us all fade away..."

Upon this ball of dirt we lived
Darkened clouds now to dwell
Wasted years of man's creation
The final silence now can tell
Dogs on leads march to war
Go ahead end it all...

Blow up the world
The final silence
Blow up the world
I don't give a damn!

2. The Immortals
[Music - Johnny; Lyrics - Johnny]

Rise - my armies - with power - from Hell - we march...

When all their power's gone and nothing's left but shame
We are the evil ones, a pestilence they say
We tear their souls apart by just being what we are
...And to forever be the ones to blame

There's nothing here for us in their world of love and trust
We vomit in their eyes and face them with disgust
We are the tyrants of the darkness as they say
...And we will never obey

So rise - my armies - with power - from Hell - we march...

We leave your god behind, he's shaking with fright
See the hatred in our eyes shining so bright
Possessed by Hell itself we stand up to charge
...And rise from the flames

This is the time for vengeance, now their end is near
We strike with hateful power, we have no fear
We are the immortals of a never ending race
...And we shall fight 'til the end

Now the time has come
For all the fools to pray
Come on, face the slayer
Now's your time to pay

So rise - immortals - with power - and might - we slay...

3. A Life Beyond
[Music - Fredrik; Lyrics - Johnny]

A life beyond reality, a must to reach the only way out
So distant to this rotten world and I know - it isn't for me
I don't care of what they say, I am myself and live my own way
Like rats they run in life's eternal wheel - but they'll never
get me

Hear the silent whispers, all the talking heads and see all
their fake smiles
Protected by a wall of laws they hide - they dare not face me
Talking in circles to start confusion
(but empty words they fly through my mind)
With all their lies and prophecies they try - but they'll
never get me

... They'll never get me

With staring eyes they follow me
(it seems to be the peak of their lives)
I hate you all, why can't you fuckin' see - you cannot scare
me
Like an image passin' by I see it ends the day that I die
Until then I'll have powers left to fight - they'll never get
me

... They'll never get me

All that's left to say... as I turn away
I hate you all... and I will 'til I fall!!

A life beyond reality, a must to reach the only way out
So distant to this rotten world and I know - it isn't for me
I don't care what they say, I am myself and live my own way
Like rats they run in life's eternal wheel - but they'll never
get me

... They'll never get me

4. Shadows In The Deep
[Music - Fredrik; Lyrics - Johnny]

Shadows in the deep, once flesh and blood
Promised to finally see the light
Taking farewell of this life's mortal Hell
Hope to face the master, his blessings to tell
But lost are the souls who gaze into void
In search for a life beyond the grave

Still shadows bleed... eternally

Shadows in the deep, longing for life
Endlessly regretting the search for the light
The mortal life is gone but still shadows bleed
Tortured are the souls from a life without sins
An eternal wait for bodily ecstasy
To revel in lust, anger and greed

Still shadows bleed... eternally

Shadows in the deep, not for man to see
Captured here forever, never to be free
Taking farewell of this life's mortal Hell
Hope to face the master, his blessings to tell
But lost are the souls who gaze into void
In search for a life beyond the grave

Beyond the grave... shadows still bleed... eternally

5. Countess Bathory
[Lant / Dunn / Bray]
[These words taken from Venom's original version]

Wellcoming the virgin's fair,
to live a noble life
In the castle known to all
The Count's infernal wife

She invites the peasants
with endless lavish foods
But, when evening spreads its wings
She rapes them of their blood

Countess Bathory
Countess Bathory

All day long the virgins sit
Feast on endless meals
The Countess laughs and sips her wine
Her skin both crack and peel

But when nighttime fills the air
One must pay the price
The Countess takes her midnight bath
with blood that once gave life

Countess Bathory
Countess Bathory

(Countess)

Countess Bathory
Countess Bathory

Living in her self-styled hell
the Countess dressed in black
Life so distant, death so near
no blood to turn time back

The castle walls are closing in
She's crippled now with age
Welcomes death with open arms
The Reaper turns the page

Countess Bathory
Countess Bathory

6. Never Ending Hate
[Music - Johnny; Lyrics - Johnny]

Mindless people without a face
Cannot stand our human race
So they call us left behind
We laugh with pride, stand and fight

Never ending hate

Politicians in the lead
Empty brains they will feed
Never trust'em not a sound
Slay'em down to the ground

Never ending hate

Try to make us compromise
Listen fast simple minds!
No pretending, we don't care
Bangin' heads everywhere

Never ending hate

Try to push us off the way
Here and now is the time to slay -
The lowest form of human life
Are fashion wimps with lying eyes
With crushing power from within
Every battle we shall win
Man of clay say goodbye
We're unleashed step aside!

Never ending hate

7. Onward Into Countless Battles
[Music - Johnny; Lyrics - Johnny]

Off we sail from Svea shores
To test our steel through out the world
Soon to come a raging battle
The strong will join and the weak shall fall
The army of immortals rise
To seek revenge of all the false
So we raise the hammer high
And call to Odin for a sign...

Join us in this holy war
Against the world and all it stands for
Crush the men of fashion's flow,
The slaves of Christ and the thrells of Islam
Riding on the blackest wind
We can't be stopped, we cannot fail
So we raise the horn of pride
And drink to glory and victory...

Onward into countless battles
We took the crown from sacred land
Soon return to Birka shores
Through storm, rain and hellish waters
Men of power, strength and might
Were born to live forever more
So we raise the hammer high
And call to Thor for a sign...

8. Crush The Skull
[Music - Johnny; Lyrics - Johnny]

Preachers of the ancient lies
Hypocrisy the golden rule
I'm laughing with sardonic wrath
At each of your ten commands

Crush the skull - sacrifice
Crush the skull - die Christ

Cursed are the poor in spirit
For they shall be spat upon
Cursed are the weak in mind
For they shall inherit the yoke

Crush the skull - sacrifice
Crush the skull - die Christ

I gaze into his glassy eyes
And pluck him by the beard
I uplift a broadaxe
And split open his worm eaten skull

Crush the skull - sacrifice
Crush the skull - die Christ

Blessed are the strong in mind
For they shall possess the earth
Blessed are the evil ways
(the sins of life)
For they shall enlight the blind

Crush the skull - sacrifice
Crush the skull - die Christ

9. Bloodbath
[Music - Johnny; Lyrics - Johnny]

Eyes cry
How nice
Screams of pain
Am I insane?

...Bloodbath

To hunt the prey
Makes my day
Break the bones
Blood flows

Torn apart
Sliced heart
Stench from Hell
I can tell

...Bloodbath

Cries - I hear nothing but - cries
Blood - I see nothing but - blood

...Bloodbath

Night fall
Victim crawl
Once again
I demand

...Bloodbath

Pain - I give nothing but - pain
Joy - I feel nothing but - joy

...Bloodbath

10. Land Of Ice
[Music - Johnny; Lyrics - Johnny]

Silent nights
Under the winter sky
In the land of ice
Where the snow is white
Silent nights
And the northern breeze
In the land of ice
Where my soul is free

...My land of ice

Silent nights
On my ancestors ground
In the land of ice
Where the hooves of Sleipnir pound
Silent nights
And the oath is sworn
In the land of ice
As my son is born

...My land of ice

Silent nights
Where all shadows lay
In the land of ice
Oh, so far away
Silent nights
Where my eyes can see
In the land of ice
I shall rest in peace

Down he rode from the hills where he was born
With sword and shield and baatle axe in hand
Young and strong he was the chosen one
To lead the armies and to defend his land
The day had come to kill the intruders
By the shore, the enemies now stand
ODIN GUIDE MY SWORD
AND I'LL SLAY THE ENEMY
ODIN GUIDE MY SWORD
TO ETERNAL VICTORY
Strenghtened by the words of his own father:
Son, you must be merciless and brave!
Never let them take an inch of land,
No, he'd never let his family be raped
Never let them march upon his fields,
No, he's never let his people be enslaved
ODIN GUIDE MY SWORD
AND I'LL SLAY THE ENEMY
ODIN GUIDE MY SWORD
TO ETERNAL VICTORY
Thor of might now throws his hammer in wrath
Thunder roar the lightning strikes the sky
Now the battle rages into chaos
Blood is running strong and the valkyries fly
Finally the defender stands victorious
And Vlahalla awaits for the brave who died
ODIN GUIDE MY SWORD

ODIN GUIDE MY SWORD
TO ETERNAL VICTORY

5. In The Name Of God
In the name of God
A preacher rapes a child
He puts his hand
On top of his little head
He says: My son
You mustn't be afraid
I am your friend
In the name of God
He now takes off his clothes
Caresses his legs
So gently with his hands
He says: My son
You mustn't be afraid
I am your friend
(You have to trust me)
He says yeah
SUCK ON THIS OR ROT IN HELL
In the name of God
He now pools out his tool
And smiles, it hurts,
He enters from behind
He says: My son
You mustn't be afraid
I am your friend
In the name of God
When the blood is flowing free
And on the floor
The helpless body lies
He says: My son
There is the will of God
(You must have a faith)
HE SAYS YEAH
SUCK ON THIS OR ROT IN HELL
Religious harmony fills the air
Where the helpless bodylies
The erected member now was satisfied
God's messiah have had this way

Embrace the silence at night
Come lust and beauty great

7. Berserk
One thousand years ago
In this land of ice and snow
Man lived with hatred just like me
The wrath lives on eternally
BERSERK
Feel no pain, there's only hate
No regret, it's all too late
I see your face, it's all I need
To grind you down and watch you bleed

I leave you trashed, for all to see
Berserk in me, eternally

9. Against The World
AGAINST THE WORLD
He was alone against the world
An outcast ever since birth
On and on night and day
They told him to behave
You must fit into society
Oh, how he tried but could not agree
Be like us and follow trends
No, he'd rather fight 'till the end
AGAINST THE WORLD
AGAINST THE WORLD
He was alone against the world
Every day a slave at work
Be a man don't make a sound!
Oh, he tried to tear him down
So he was one of a kind
But theycould not control his mind
And he knew the day will come
To take revenge on every one
AGAINST THE WORLD

10. Revenge
Doomed for all eternity
Cause I never could agree
A normal life I will deny
Do not bother asking why!
From the shadows where I dwell
Here's my way to give you hell
REVENGE
Years have passed and I'm still alive
Censorship is a fascist lie
A thousand times I'll rise again
You can't escape my last revenge
For all the times you've let me down
I'll crush your face into the ground
REVENGE
REVENGE
Come forth on precious hate
My vengeance is your fate
Come feel my last revenge
So painful until the end
REVENGE
REVENGE
REVENGE

1. To Asgaard We Fly
Guided by my father's call
End of search, I hear them all
Now my quest is to live your dream
Land of the free passed on to me

I hail to thee on precious land
Brave & grand so strong she stands
Reaching from the mountains high
Down to the woods where the ravens fly

To asgaard we fly
The spirit will never die

I gaze across the open sea
Ships return but soon to leave
For all the men in battle slain
Let their spirits guide the way

Warrior of faith and pride
A spirit that can never die
With sword & shield I stand on guard
I'll fight til'death, we'll never part

To asgaard we fly
The spirit will never die

Guided by my father's call
End of search, I hear them all
Now my quest is to live your dream
Land of the free passed on to me

Brave & grand so strong she stands
Reaching from the mountains high
Down to the woods where the ravens fly

To asgaard we fly
The spirit will never die

Evil wrath
Live forever
Deep inside
Strong as ever
Growing hate
Rising higher
Open wide
Spit forth fire

Silent churning

Arise like steam
Reaching higher
Free at last
A strom of powers

Live forever
Deep inside
Strong as ever
Growing hate

Hear my holy lies
I fool the poor & weak
To the light they seek
I sell the blessings for
50 dollars more

I am god
I kill people just for pleasure

I love to see them cry
And watch them slowly die
I lead every war
Trust in me for a better score
I don't care at all
If they stand or fall

I am God
I kill people just for pleasure

I plot a way for the destruction
Of the earth
To plague, starvation and diseases
I gave birth
I let them all die, cause my will
Is the law
The bullets of war are all mine

Can't tou see the light?
I preach the holy way
Join or be my prey

Cannot be this way
Must stay out of range

I am the psychopath
I live in my own world
I'll be the one you fear
...the one insane

So a doktor said
It was the best for me
To give me coloured pills

So I hit him with a hetchet
And ran from my cell
Need no special cure
To try keep my well

...the one insane

5. Across The Open Sea
[INSTRUMENTAL]

6. In The Northern Lands
Gods on high, behold...!
To thee I reach for might

Long ago in the northern lands
They sacrificed for might
Brothers Three who killed to give
Mortals land and sea
Midgaards rose from giant's flesh
Slaughtered to give life
Hail to the allseeing,
He who for wisdom gave his eye

Gods on high, behold...!
To thee I reach for might

The ravens flay across the plains
TO tell their master's tales
Tales beyond narrow minds
Weak lambs led astray
Our gift of blood & life to thee
O ancient heathen gods
Therefore now to thee we give
This human sacrifice

Gods on high, behold...!
To thee I reach for might

Long ago in the northern lands
They sacrificed for might
Brothers Three who killed to give
Mortals land and sea
Midgaards rose from giant's flesh
Slaughtered to give life
Hail to the allseeing,
He who for wisdom gave his eye

7. Forever Goodbye (2045)
Memories of a troubled past
Appears before my eyes
It seems to be the very last
I see before I fly
High above the earth and soon
To reach another day
The good old 1995
Is now just a memory

...goodbye

Flying high above the sky
As the planet burns
A journey to another world
There is no return
Visions are dancing in my mind
Of pictures never seen
Where the day and night are one
And life just cannot be

...goodbye

From the end of the universe
I scream in endless vain
I've realized I never will
See the sun again
I wonder as the hours pass
If someone will ever find
This message from another time
2045...

...forever... goodbye

8. Execute Them All
As my final call
Sounds the charge
...to war

I hate the universe and everything inside
I detest all I see, nothing pleases my mind

Execute them all
It's my final war

I hate the sight of you, fashion fake
Joke
I detest every man who cannot stand
Alone

Execute them all
It's my final war

As my final call
Sounds the charge
...to war

I hate the tales you tell, I don't
Believe a word
I detest the stuf you sell, I'll hunt
You around the world

Execute them all
It's my final war

When my days are numbered you'll hear
My final call
I'll take their lives away, I'll execute
Them all

Execute them all
It's my final war

Execute them all
It's my final war

9. Captured
I see the morning light breaking in
Another day, another hell within
Yesterday's sorrows come creeping by
Soon to remind my of tomorrow's lies
I gasp for air I scream for sight
Haven't seen anything yet that seems
To be right
I see the rats run their endless race
As I wake up to face another day...
(I must get... out)

...I'm captured

I see the darkness slowly fall
Into my room as I tear at the walls
And as a million dreams come sweeping by
Soon they will vanish like scattered lies
I reach for light but I cannot flee
An empty reality as all I see
I watch the mutants run their endless race
As I try to forget yet another day...
(I must get... out)

...I'm captured

I see the morning light breaking in
Another day, another hell within
Yesterday's sorrows come creeping by
Soon to remind my of tomorrow's lies
I gasp for air I scream for sight
Haven't seen anything yet that seems
To be right
I see the rats run their endless race
As I wake up to face another day...
(I must get... out)

...I'm captured

10. Breaking The Law
[Originally performed by Judas Priest]

The road was completely wasting
Out of working down
All inside it's so first rating
As I turn in town in town
Fill that nobody care
Is darling watch out
Nothing could begin
To put action in my wife

Breaking the law

So much further don't do future
I kept it even start
How on break promise broken
Aching my heart
You don't know what is life
You don't have a clue
If you need you be yourself
Do the same thing too

Breaking the law

You don't know what is the life

11. The General
Up he rose & forth they went
Into the battleground, fortress, tent
Mountains, wilderness, fielsd & farm
The soldier & the general arm in arm

Off they ride
Side by side

"Through the travail of ages
Midst the pomp & toils of war
Have I fought, strove and perished
Countless times under the stars
As it through a glass and darkly
The ageal stripe I see
I fought in many guises, many names
But it was always me..."

Off they ride
Side by side

I was there in...
Lived & died...

So up he rose & forth they went
Into the battleground, fortress, tent
Mountains, wilderness, fielsd & farm
The soldier & the general arm in arm

Off they ride
Side by side

Too long you've slandered our name
And dragged us all in the dust
Arguments of incompetence

Smoke is rising from the mountain
The mountain of doom
A great eye, lidless, wrapped in flame
On the tower of Barad-Dûr
We must join with him
We must join with Sauron

We must join with him

The lord of Mordor sees it all
Gathering all evil without rest

We must join with Sauron

On the endless path of war
We may be torn and beat
But we have sworn to stand as one
In victory or defeat

We are the immortals
From Hell we rise

We are the immortals
From Hell we rise
We are the immortals

6. Triumph Of Genocide
Civilian killing squads
With clubs and machetes
So the killing starts
There is no escape
From the interahamwe
Clubbed, burned and raped

The triumph of genocide
The United Nations stood aside
And watched the triumph of genocide

Bodies floating down
The Kigara river
Tied, hacked and drowned
Average killing rate
Thousands by the day
The UN evacuates

The triumph of genocide
The United Nations stood aside
And watched the triumph of genocide

Upon this land his forefathers walked
The call from the past
That warms his heart
Decades pass by, the changing of time
Still there's a fire that burns inside

Odin... Hear my call!

The struggle to survive
The seeds he has sown
All he has built can soon be gone
The deeds of white Christ
Which must be avenged
He summons the Gods,
for courage and strength

Odin... Hear my call!
Odin... Hear my call!

The cold wind blows
And the hour draws near
He must stand his ground
With shield and spear
Its time for the warrior
To defend his kin
For a new dawn to rise
Its a battle he must win

Odin... Hear my call!
Odin... Hear my call!
Odin... Hear my call!
Odin... Hear my call!

8. Salvation For Mankind
Stolen from a Roman cave
By a follower in need
Of a selfish holy tale
To plant the Christian seed
Took the bones and ran away
Resurrection is the sign
Soon he'll come to us again
It's salvation for mankind

Yeah, resurrect so I can vomit on the
The body of Christ
Yeah, resurrect so I can vomit on the
The body of Christ

Don't you see the holy sign?
Its an act of God you've seen
Here's the proof, an empty tomb
Not a thing to be revealed!
Millions praying all in vain
For the secret to unwind
Waiting for the second coming
It's salvation for mankind

Yeah, resurrect so I can vomit on the
The body of Christ
Yeah, resurrect so I can vomit on the
The body of Christ

9. Psycho Killer
I'm all that you want me to be
Yeah, read about me soon
I drink the blood of babies fresh
I am impending doom
I kill for pleasure yes I do
Or is it out of greed?
Another day, another death
I'm what the public needs

I am a psycho killer
I am a psycho killer

The politicians love me too
I am a human shame
For unemployment and inflation
I am the one to blame
I'm a star in the evening news
A lamb left to die
Another story covered up
Some other fucking lie

I am a psycho killer
I am a psycho killer

I drink the blood of a newborn child
I'm all about death
I kill for pleasure yes I do
I confess

I am a psycho killer
I am a psycho killer

10. The Witch
Dressed in black, a flame from Hell
You feel her presence all too well
She'll take you for a magic ride
To Hell and back with legs astride
She'll take all that she needs
Leave your mind and soul to bleed

Dressed in black, a flame from Hell
The witch has casted her spell

Domination, lust will reign
Her lions are aflame
The nectar mixed with sweat
Dripping from her eager cleft
Shall act as pollen rain
To your slumbering brain

Dressed in black, a flame from Hell
The witch has casted her spell

11. I Have Sworn Allegiance
Welcome warriors of Unleashed
Tonight is our time to feast
You know its always worth the wait
Lets drink to Thor and celebrate

I have sworn allegiance
I have sworn allegiance
I have sworn allegiance

We've traveled far to prove our faith
No sacrifice can be too great
Our home is this Viking hall
United we shall stand or fall

I have sworn allegiance
I have sworn allegiance
I have sworn allegiance

Odin bade me his welcome
Into his hall of the slain
To reserve a place for the faithful ones
The immortals - The warriors of Unleashed
Who all swore to stand as one... forever
To you I have sworn, to you I have sworn
I have sworn allegiance eternally

12. Age Of The Warrior
Decades of despair, Christian decadence
And human defeat
Where no life dwells a new power grew
Like shadows in the deep
Immortal spirits bred in Hell
In time, all will see

It's the age of the warrior
The age of the warrior
The age of the warrior

Across the open sea, from land to land
It was time for victory
They fight so proud, with a warrior spirit
As Hell's unleashed
The have sworn allegiance,
With loyalty and pride
In time, all will see

It's the age of the warrior
The age of the warrior
The age of the warrior

13. New Dawn Rising
Join us in this great adventure
Our common time on earth
To make the best of what you've got
For better or for worse
Tomorrow shall belong to you
Stand up and face the world

New dawn rising
New dawn rising

We are the ones to write the pages
Of coming history
Deadly metal onward pounding
Innovative and free
So behold the new dawn rising
A new creation is unleashed

New dawn rising
New dawn rising

14. Loyalty And Pride
A man of the ancient way
From a barren land he came
With a spirit forged of steel
To become a man that never kneels
To anyone or anything
His strength lies deep within

The mark of faith
He wears with pride
The Hammer is his sign
The mark of faith
He wears with pride
The Hammer is his sign

The Hammer is his sign
Of loyalty and pride
A Viking warrior of today
From any land from any place
Holding his head up high
Through war and troubled times

The mark of faith
He wears with pride
The Hammer is his sign
The mark of faith
He wears with pride
The Hammer is his sign

With a mind of honest deeds
And a spirit that is free
He'll fight for kin and tribe
With them he'll live and die

15. Valhalla Awaits
The battle is over
Blood covers the plain
Courage is proven
Brave men died this day

Oh the Valkyries fly
To choose from those who died
Oh the Valkyries fly

Valhalla awaits

Choosers of the slain
Honor the brave men's call
Soon the Einheriar
Rise again in Odin's hall

Oh the Valkyries fly
To choose from those who died
Oh the Valkyries fly

Valhalla awaits

1. Winterland
Forest silent waiting
Frozen winter breeze
Snowfall ever lasting
Covers mountains and fields
Ice... cold... winterland
Ice... cold... winterland
The mighty Thor has spoken
Autumns final breath
The dying of all living
The triumph of nature & death
Ice... cold... winterland
Ice... cold... winterland
Ice... cold... winterland
Ice... cold... winterland

2. Destruction (Of The Race Of Men)
Saruman commands his army
An army of 10000 strong
To march upon the land of Rohan
A war on man that must be won
From Isengard the Uruk-Hai march off to war
For destruction, destruction
For destruction of the race of men
Isengard has been unleashed
The Uruk-Hai march to war
They will leave no one alive
Helm's deep is soon to fall
From Isengard the Uruk-Hai march off to war
For destruction, destruction
For destruction of the race of men
Destruction, for destruction
For destruction of the race of men
"A new power is rising
It's victory is at hand"
"There will be no dawn of men"
Destruction, for destruction
Of the race of men
Destruction, for destruction
Of the race of men

3. Only The Dead
Only the dead
You open wide and prepare to receive
A hunger sex unseen
You crave hard penetration
And order me to come deep
You'd be all right just to suck me dry
But you can beg and plead...
I only fuck the dead
I only fuck the dead
Only the dead
This ain't no game, it's about life & death
To satisfy you needs
You demand a sensation
And crave my anal feed
You'd be all right with just a "golden rain"
But you can beg and plead...
I only fuck the dead
I only fuck the dead
Only the dead

4. The Longships Are Coming
Lindisfarne, holy land
Of pilgrimage for the christian man
Church of god, and monastery
8th of June, in the year of 793
The longships are coming
The longships are coming
The longships are coming
The longships are coming
Oh lord, hear us pray
Save us from the norsemen's rage
In despair, final grasp
The longships are coming
The longships are coming
The longships are coming
The longships are coming

5. Helljoy
There is no holy land
No better place to dwell
Here is our day of joy
Here and now is our hell
I am my own god
I am my own slave
There is no redeemer
To see me through the day
Helljoy - pressure of the flesh
Helljoy - indulgence 'til death
Helljoy - pressure of the flesh
Helljoy - indulgence 'til death
There is no glorious heaven
But the one you create
Live your life in sin
Live before it's too late
You must take control
Pleasure of the flesh
Cut the moral leash
Indulgence 'til death
Helljoy - pressure of the flesh
Helljoy - indulgence 'til death
Helljoy - pressure of the flesh
Helljoy - indulgence 'til death

6. Insane For Blood
Insane hunger, cold heart beating
Intense bloodlust, pressure increasing
All excited at every reek of death
Stop at nothing, must feed from human flesh
Insane for blood
Insane for blood
The frustration keeps on peaking
Internal torment pain comes creeping
The night's falling must seek another prey
A new source of blood to live another day
Insane for blood
Insane for blood

7. I Bring You Death
Once a friend
With open arms
A moment black
Now dagger sharp sits in my back
Felt the pain
Seeing red
It's all too late
Before my eyes the veil of hate
You took my soul, I'll take your flesh
So filled with rage I bring you death
I bring you death
I bring you death
On you knees
Before me bleed
How's it feel?
To be the one to be deceived
See the life
Now drain away
As you die
Your filthy pleas jusr pass me by
You took my soul, I'll take your flesh
So filled with rage I bring you death
I bring you death
I bring you death

8. Attack!
[Instrumental]

9. CEO
Rich parents and poor hygiene
Born in the 40's to a life of luxury
You sucked all the right cocks well
To get a really nice job your dad can tell
You call home and say you're working late
But there's another thing now that just can't wait...
What a leader the CEO!
His big secret just doesn't show
He pays a girl to get him through
Puts on his diaper and feed him gruel
A big house, the suburban dream you have
A boring ass wife and a daughter crack queen
You drink drive the brand new car
Na djust bribe another cop when you get caught
You whine out loud 'bout the income tax
Because the monthly 5000 Euros never last
What a leader the CEO!
His big secret just doesn't show
He pays a girl to get him through
Puts on his diaper and feed him gruel

10. One Night In Nazareth
Oh, Virgin Mary, maiden of the lord
You are the chosen one, one lucky whore
Don't be afraid now, you've got grace with me
I'll come upon you yeah in just a little less harmony
I'll be your incubus
The angel you can trust
I don't need you to breed
Just swallow all my seed
One night in Nazareth, with the chosen one
So let it be written, so let it be done
I'll be your incubus
The angel you can trust
I don't need you to breed
Just swallow all my seed

11. Praised Be The Lord

13. To Miklagård
From Birka the norsemen set sail
Across the wide open Baltic sea
At Lagoda and Novgorod they settled
Slaves and fur they would trade for silver and silk
Forward to Miklagård
Forward to Miklagård
On the Dnjepr, they struggled to pass Aifur
Around Kiev, tribes and folk were gathered
And the new master's name was the infamous Rus!
Two thousand ships that sailed the Black sea...
Forward to Miklagård
Forward to Miklagård

14. Long Live The Beast
Nothing's left from the final war
Feeble race exists no more
Time is up for the rule of man
It's an age swallowed by the sand
Long live the beast
In this final curtain call
Long live the beast
That will outlive us all
Long live the beast
In this final curtain call
Long live the beast
That will outlive us all
All is dead, silence in the air
Smell of death is everywhere
In a lair from ages past
Something's born in this aftermath
Long live the beast
In this final curtain call
Long live the beast
That will outlive us all
Long live the beast
In this final curtain call
Long live the beast
That will outlive us all

1. Don't Want To Be Born
I don't want to be born...

I lay here and wait it this virgin's womb
My pleasure dwells right here within this tomb

I don't want to be born

Intensive silence, all in blood red
A spawn of hell I am the evil dead

I don't want to be born
Don't want to be born

3. Demoneater
Demons haunt my every waking hour
Making life into a living hell
Need to keep it down, I need to end it
Searching for the one thing that can help
Demoneater's there within my reaches
To calm the storm that rages in my head

Demoneater

5. Mrs. Minister
You preach your message of moral high
Heaven knows how you must lie
A sound Christian life, how sad
So restrained, but you need it so bad

Mrs. Minister, so prude and upper glass
Mrs. Minister, the night comes
And you're switching fast
Mrs. Minister, becomes the dildo queen
Mrs. Minister, you jam it up
Then suck it clean

Born rich, of high society
Will respected for all to see
Cannot mix with the working man
Oh so proud, but you need it so bad

Mrs. Minister, so prude and upper glass
Mrs. Minister, the night comes
And you're switching fast
Mrs. Minister, becomes the dildo queen
Mrs. Minister, you jam it up
Then suck it clean

6. Joy In The Sun
Wanna go on a date
Gonna have some fun
Pick you up in my new car
Take a ride in the sun
Driving down the boulevard
Headin' down to the beach
Gonna drive real slow now
Grab a hold on me...

(...for some...)
Formaldehyde fun
Joy in the sun
Formaldehyde fun
Joy in the sun

Well then here we go
Rock around the clock
Playin'hide and sick now
She sure knows how to suck
Such a nice little mouth
Drives a man insane
Guess I ain't that dead yet
Taste that smell again...

(...of some...)
Formaldehyde fun
Joy in the sun
Formaldehyde fun
Joy in the sun

7. Demons Rejoice
Rejoice
The demon rejoice

In the fires of hell
The demons that dwell

Rejoice

Come shadows of the deep
All evil unleashed

Rebellion in wait
Infernal pure hate
Churning blood, now black
They plot a way from attack

Rejoice
The demon rejoice

8. We'll Come For You
Demons gather slowly around this city of hell
The zombies are dancing in the moonlight
A feast for all you sinners of joy and blasphemy
The evil armies attack to night

We'll come for you
We'll come for you
We'll come for you
Ain't nothing you can do

A morbid angel signs with demented voice
The orchs are pounding the drums of doom and night
Men and ghouls with blackened eyes and faces deranged
The evil armies attack to night

We'll come for you
We'll come for you
We'll come for you
Ain't nothing you can do
We'll come for you
We'll come for you
We'll come for you

10. Dissection Leftovers
Flesh... cat... flesh

I wake up at night so hungry for blood
The taste of a new corpse I feel
Illusions of bodies dismemberment fresh
Dissection leftovers for me
I break into a morgue or a hospital near
My organ erects eagerly
I search for the dishes the surgeon has left
Dissection leftovers for me

Flesh... cat... flesh

I revel in blood and I revel in flesh
There's never enough for my needs
I carve on the limbs and I chew with delight
Dissection leftovers for me

Flesh... cat... flesh

11. Peace, Piece By Piece
I am the one, the man, the myth with a knife
Destined to take your life
I am Mr. Insane
Now let me taste your pain

I'll cut you piece by piece
Oh man I feeled so pleased
Only death can end this show
Peace for my restless soul

I'm the god and I'm here to seal your fate
You'll suffer my evil hate
I am the Mr. Insane
Killing is just a game

I'll cut you piece by piece
Oh man I feeled so pleased
Only death can end this show
Peace for my restless soul

Peace, piece by piece

12. Burnt Alive
Burnt Alive
She was burnt Alive

Before the holy cross
The priest of christ he knelt
Oh help me mighty god
And save me from this hell
She still rejecting me
Oh god why can't she see
Tell me it's your will
To set my seed free

And god said:
In fire... you tie her...
To the stake... you witch
She was burnt alive
She was burnt alive
...burnt alive

Before the holy cross
Again he knelt and grinned
Oh help her mighty god
And save her from this sin
She cares not for my right
To take her when I please
It is the will of god
To set my seed free

And god said:
In fire... you tie her...
To the stake... you witch
She was burnt alive
She was burnt alive
She was burnt alive
She was burnt alive
...burnt alive

13. Your Head Is Mine
Your head is mine
With my choice of wine

I want your body and I want your flesh
I plunge the dagger in oh what a mess
I cannot stand and wait for you to die
Your body drenched in blood I'll eat you dead or alive
I feast on young ones and I feast on the old
I just gut'em up and spice'em then fold...
You are my evening dinner can't you see
I've got this special taste in humans I feed

Your head is mine
With my choice of wine
Your head is mine
With my choice of wine

I want your body and I need your flesh
I plunge the dagger in oh what a mess
I cannot stand and wait for your last cry
Your body drenched in blood I'll eat you dead or alive
I take the young ones and I take'em old
I just gut'em up and spice'em then fold...
You are my evening dinner can't you see
I've got this special taste in humans I feed

Your head is mine
With my choice of wine
Your head is mine
With my choice of wine

7. Hero Of The Land
[Music - Johnny]
[Lyrics - Johnny]

LONG AGO WHEN THE CENTURY WAS YOUNG
LIVED A MAN WHO PASSED HIS LAND ON TO HIS SON
LONG AGO WHEN THE MORAL OF MAN WAS HIGH
LIFE WAS A BATTLE JUST TO SURVIVE
EVERY DAY A STRUGGLE AND A TOIL
TO HARVEST THE LAND AND TO SEED THE SOIL
HE WORKED IN THE FOREST AND HE WORKED IN THE FIELDS
WORKED DAY AND NIGHT TO FEED HIS FAMILY

BEHOLD THE OLD MAN - STRIVING ALL HE CAN
BEHOLD THE OLD MAN - FOR HE IS THE HERO OF THE LAND

HE NEVER CARED MUCH FOR FORTUNE AND FAME
HE NEVER CRIED AND HE NEVER COMPLAINED
HE BUILT HIS DREAM WITH HIS BARE HANDS & MIND
A SIMPLE MAN BUT AN ARTIST OF LIFE
AND STILL TODAY AS I BEHOLD THE OLD MAN
I SEE HIM STRIVING ALL THAT HE CAN
ONE OF THESE DAYS HE'LL PASS HIS LAND ON TO HIS SON
LET HIS SPIRIT GUIDE US WHEN THIS CENTURY IS GONE...

BEHOLD THE OLD MAN - STRIVING ALL HE CAN
BEHOLD THE OLD MAN - FOR HE IS THE HERO OF THE LAND

ONE OF THESE DAYS... I'LL BE THE OLD MAN
AND I'LL WILL  FIGHT FOR MY FAMILY AND LAND

BEHOLD THE OLD MAN - STRIVING ALL HE CAN
BEHOLD THE OLD MAN - THE HERO OF THE LAND

BEHOLD THE OLD MAN - STRIVING ALL HE CAN
BEHOLD THE OLD MAN - FOR HE IS THE HERO OF THE LAND

[Music - Johnny]
[Lyric - Johnny]

BOMBS GO OFF AND SHAKE THE GROUND
RADIATION ALL AROUND
IT DOESN'T SMELL, IT DOESN'T SOUND
ALL SURVIVED OR SO IT SEEMS
ANOTHER NUCLEAR LIFE BEGINS
A CHILD IS BORN WITH TWISTED LIMBS

BORN DERANGED
BORN DERANGED
BORN DERANGED

BORN A MUTANT SO DERANGED
CANNOT SEE IT'S PARENTS FACE
CANCER INSIDE GROWING PAIN
COUGHING BLOOD, THE DAYS GO BY
ORGANS SLOWLY BURN INSIDE
ALIVE DECAYING, HOPE TO DIE

BORN DERANGED
BORN DERANGED
BORN DERANGED

BORN DERANGED
BORN DERANGED
BORN DERANGED

BORN DERANGED OUR PRICE TO PAY
FOR THE EUROPEAN UNION'S AIM -
TO LEAD THE MARKET'S "HALL OF SHAME"
FACE THE FACT: IT'S JUST A PART
OF UNITED STATES OF EUROPE'S START -
THIS LITTLE "GIFT" FROM JACQUES CHIRAC

BORN DERANGED
BORN DERANGED
BORN DERANGED

MJOLLNIR SHALL GUIDE US THROUGH THE BATTLE

...I HAVE RETURNED

I HAVE THE POWER
TO CRUSH THE FORCES OF DECADENCE
I HAVE THE POWER
TO TAKE BACK WHAT'S RIGHTFULLY MINE

I AM THE NEW AGE
WHERE NATURE REGAINS IT'S STRENGTH
I AM THE NEW AGE
WHERE MAN IS ABOVE ALL GODS

...I HAVE RETURNED

11. Ragnarök
[Music - Johnny]
[Lyrics -Johnny]

15000 YEARS
THE EXCEPTION OF MANKIND
THE TIME TO LIVE, THE TIME TO DIE
...AGAIN

THE END OF ALL... SOON TO BEGIN
THE COMING OF THE ETERNAL ICE:

RAGNARK... RAGNARK

YEARS OF WARS
MAN AGAINST MAN
LAKES OF BLOOD... FLOW
BURNING HORIZONS
THE SUN IS BLACK...

RAGNARK... RAGNARK

15000 YEARS
THE EXCEPTION OF MANKIND
THE TIME TO LIVE, THE TIME TO DIE...

12. Your Pain, My Gain
[Music - Anders / Johnny]
[Lyrics - Anders]

YOUR PAIN - MY GAIN

SO MUCH HATRED
TOWARDS MAN
A TRUE PSYCHO
YES I AM
I WILL FEED YOU
WITH FAKE TRUST
BUT YOU'LL MEET MY
MORBID LUST

YOUR PAIN - MY GAIN

NOW I'VE GOT YOU
ON YOUR KNEES
AND I'LL USE YOU
AS I PLEASE
WHEN I KILL YOU
PEACE OF MIND
A LIFE TAKEN
I FEEL FINE

13. The End
[Music - Fredrik]
[Lyrics - Fredrik]

THE WORLD IS OLD AND TIRED
IN MY DREAMS I SEE THE END
NOW I SEE THINGS CLEARER
I WILL NOT BE CONDEMNED

MY MIND REQUIRES
THE VOICES DEMAND
MY MIND REQUIRES
THE VOICES DEMAND
...THE END

THE SUN HAS SOON BURNED OUT
THE SIGNS ARE THERE TO BE SEEN
THE STARS ARE FALLING DOWN
THE ONLY GOD IS ME

MY MIND REQUIRES
THE VOICES DEMAND
MY MIND REQUIRES
THE VOICES DEMAND
...THE END

THE SOULLESS CHILD IS BORN
IN MY DREAMS I SEE THE END
THEY WHISPER IN MY HEAD
THE WORLD WILL BE CONDEMNED

MY MIND REQUIRES
THE VOICES DEMAND
MY MIND REQUIRES
THE VOICES DEMAND
...THE END
...THE END
...THE END

UNLEASHED LYRICS


1. Courage Today, Victory Tomorrow!
At the ends of all things
Behold what nature brings
For what comes on the final day
You must be brave

Oh heed my call!
Courage today, victory tomorrow!
Courage today, victory tomorrow!

The great war of our time
Gods and men side by side
Like in the past as they fell
Some must survive to tell
The old tales without end
The legacy passed on again
In a new time, a new place
We shall live the ancient way

Oh heed my call!
Courage today, victory tomorrow!
Courage today, victory tomorrow!

Oh heed my call!
Courage today, victory tomorrow!
Courage today, victory tomorrow!

...and so it begins...

2. So It Begins
All that was the past
Comes to an end
Survive and evolve
Or die again
The hour of change
So definite in sight
Indiscriminately
The unprepared will die

So it begins
The unprepared will die

It is the dawn of truth
And it dominates
Like a pestilence
With no cure but fate
Rejuvenating death
The seeds of a new time
Induscriminately
The unprepared will die

So it begins
The unprepared will die
So it begins
The unprepared will die

It is the dawn of truth
...as Yggdrasil trembles...

3. As Yggdrasil Trembles
What troubles the earth, wind and sea
What powers will be unleashed
Is the age of mankind soon gone
Are we prepared for what will come
Whatever stirs beyond the dark has no shame
Nothing will ever be the same

Battalions of the world are you ready?
For the lasting cold and the darkness
Battalions of the world are you ready?

What will the future hold
What horrors are yet to unfold
Is this our way to Odin's hall
Are we prepared for the final call
Whatever stirs beyond the dark has no shame
Nothing will ever be the same

Battalions of the world are you ready?
For the lasting cold and the darkness
Battalions of the world are you ready?
As the mighty Yggdrasil trembles
Battalions of the world are you ready?

Our loyalty will be tested
Allegiance to Midgard we have sworn
As the mighty Yggdrasil trembles
We stand to face the new dawn

Battalions of the world are you ready?
For the lasting cold and the darkness
Battalions of the world are you ready?
As the mighty Yggdrasil trembles
Battalions of the world are you ready?
As the mighty Yggdrasil trembles
Battalions of the world are you ready?

4. Wir Kapitulieren Niemals
Wir kapitulieren niemals
(We will never surrender)

Face the fact here we are
You said we'd never come this far
Viking death metal
Viking death metal
We took you all for a ride
As 20 years were passing by
Viking death metal
Viking death metal

Was andere sagen ist uns scheissegal
Wir kapitulieren niemals
(We will never surrender)

Risen from an ancient force
To the hammer we are sworn
Viking death metal
Viking death metal
Listen up and listen fast
We are the future and the past
Viking death metal
Viking death metal

Was andere sagen ist uns scheissegal
Wir kapitulieren niemals
(We will never surrender)

All the world against us
The enemy is great
But this is our life, this is our fate
We drink to Odin, we drink to Thor
With swords drawn onward into war

Was andere sagen ist uns scheissegal
Wir kapitulieren niemals
(We will never surrender)

5. This Time We Fight
So many years
He struggled hard
And stood against the oppression
He saw the fall
Of all his kin
In a dark premonition

As the battle rages
Will this be his day to die?
He holds his hammer toward the sky
This time we fight!

Now is the day
For the justice
So rightfully claimed
He called to arms
Sharpened his axe
And put on his chain
The call to rise
And be strong
As the hour grows near
A blot to Thor
For protection
And against all fear

As the battle rages
Will this be his day to die?
He holds his hammer toward the sky
This time we fight!
He holds his hammer toward the sky
This time we fight!

6. Master Of The Ancient Art
I rule the living
I claim the dead
Bringer of good and evil
As mankind will be led
I tame the winds of time
And decide all fate
The creator of purpose
Teacher of the ways

I am the master - master of the ancient art
I am the master - master of the ancient art

I am the warrior
Of the glory and the might
Tyr armed me with his sword
For the battle of life
I rule the kingdom of beasts
Oppose me and fall
Behold the most vicious animal
Of them all

I am the master - master of the ancient art
I am the master - master of the ancient art

7. Chief Einherjar
In a world of black and white
His colours blazed
A heart that burned like a thousand fires
With the passion to create
Every day a new challenge
Was taken by storm
Not a chance for a dampened spirit
As new ideas were born

I think you know...
You have my sword
Chief Einherjar
You have my sword
Chief Einherjar

All against the odds as trouble came
But no task to great
Gave us courage to stand the ground
Put no trust in fate
A true warrior, yes he was
Right until the end
In the halls of Valhalla
We shall meet again

I think you know...
You have my sword
Chief Einherjar
You have my sword
Chief Einherjar

8. Return Fire
You're think we're easy prey
A battle without losses
So load your guns and aim
Come at us anytime
With everything you've got!
Be the next in line (as we...)
Return fire, return fire...

Your chances will decrease
As Odin chooses side
Attack us and you'll see
We were born to fight
No mercy will be given
Target now in sight
Return fire, return fire...

Battalions lock and load
Guns ready, aim, fire!
Battalions on my command
Guns ready, aim, fire!

We rise against you all
In every town and nation
Until you flee or fall
The warriors of the brave
Now standing firm and strong
Will win or die this day
Return fire, return fire...

Better listen fast
This is our final warning
You cannot hope to last
Against the rapid fire
From one of our battalions
There will be no survival...
Return fire, return fire...

Battalions lock and load
Guns ready, aim, fire!
Battalions on my command
Guns ready, aim, fire!

9. Far Beyond Hell10. Dead To Me
The time is up, the dices are cast
So it came to this at last
The words you spoke were all too grand
No turning back you little man
And since you lack common sense
Suffer now the consequence
Suffer the consequence
Suffer the consequence

What you will experience is far beyond hell
So far beyond hell

A second chance you beg for me
Oh, i have ways to set you free
Your praying death comes without pain
Well killing isn't quite my game
I see now that you understand
For you i have this special pain
Suffer the consequence
Suffer the consequence

What you will experience is far beyond hell
So far beyond hell
What you will experience is far beyond hell
So far beyond hell

10. Dead To Me
Tied up in a moral life, made up like a play
Systematized and tamed
Play a role in every part, never step aside
Too boring and too lame

So you kneel...
And come crawling at my feet
You're dead to me
I'm not the one you seek
You're dead to me

Always living in the past and in lack of words
Searching for a fate
Waiting for the peak of life, it is all a dream
And it's getting much too late
Wake up to another world, all the same but new
The needs you cannot meet
Look around and face the fact, your time is running out
Christ is obsolete

Yet you kneel...
And come crawling at my feet
You're dead to me
I'm not the one you seek
You're dead to me

11. Yahweh And The Chosen Ones
You are a holy people to your god
And god has chosen you, this is your call
For all the earth is mine and you shall be onto me
A kingdom of priests and a holy nation above all

Our king is truth, and nothing else compares
Bow to the holy one
Blessed is he
Now to the holy one
Down on your knees

Praised are you, Lord our God, King of the universe
Who has chosen us out of all the nations on earth
Raised us above all tongues and made us holy
Through his commandments, we are holy from birth

Our king is truth, and nothing else compares
Bow to the holy one
Blessed is he
Now to the holy one
Down on your knees

For god did not make us like the nations of other lands
And did not make us the same as other families of the earth
God did not place us in the same situations as others
And our destiny is not the same as anyone else's

Bow to the holy one
Blessed is he
Now to the holy one
Down on your knees

12. Cannibalistic Epidemic Continues
O taste the goodness
Of our god
And eat his flesh
And drink his blood
Come and partake
In the gospel feast
Be saved from sin
And feel at peace

Cannibalistic epidemic continues
Cannibalistic epidemic continues

Embrace the holy communion!
Eat - this is my body
Drink - this is my blood

Give not that which a holy
To the dogs
Honour me as i die
Don't share me with hogs

Cannibalistic epidemic continues
Cannibalistic epidemic continues

Embrace the holy communion!
Eat - this is my body
Drink - this is my blood

Cannibalistic epidemic continues
Cannibalistic epidemic continues

Embrace the holy communion!
Eat - this is my body
Drink - this is my blood
Eat - this is my body
Drink - this is my blood

1. The Greatest Of All Lies
Oppressing the poor, mocking the sick
Crusader of virtues, your holy fire lit
Blessed be the ones who will not fight
Against the words of the moral tyrant's might

The empty prayers of absolution that dies
Obedient souls bow to the passion of the Christ

The passion of the Christ
The greatest of all lies
The greatest of all lies

The Christian values a marketing game
Through holy wars and terror in your name
Upon this rock your church has been built
For all mankind, to live in fear and guilt
The empty prayers of absolution that dies
Obedient souls bow to the passion of the Christ

The passion of the Christ
The greatest of all lies
The greatest of all lies

Nailed to the cross, as death sets in
The blood of Christ spilled for all human sins

The great illusion of his final sigh
Obedient souls bow to the passion of the Christ

The passion of the Christ
The greatest of all lies
The greatest of all lies

My God, why hast thou forsaken me?

2. Long Before Winter's Call
Now it came to pass in those days
There went out a decree
From Caesar on his throne
That all the world should be enrolled

So Joseph took Mary to the balls
And from Nazareth they went
To the city of Bethlehem
For registration and taxing, right on then

The bastard child was born
Long before winter's call
The bastard child was born
Long before winter's call

And it came to pass, while they were there
That she was great with child
Lived in a stable 'til it was done
She brought forth her bastard son

And as the shepherds in the field
Were keeping watch over their flocks at night
An angel of the lord
Said unto them a saviour has been born

The bastard child was born
Long before winter's call
The bastard child was born
Long before winter's call

3. Your Children Will Burn
Religious filth, spreading like the plague
Bombs and prayers
The damage you've done, will not be gone
In a thousand years

The world had been a captive
I bring you

Destruction,hatred and terror
You will bleed for me
Destruction,hatred and terror
You children will burn

I laugh at your faith, you are all the same
Maggots of God
Prophets and priests, and their fascist beliefs
Will be torn apart

The world will be mine again

Destruction,hatred and terror
You will bleed for me
Destruction,hatred and terror
You children will burn

4. Hammer Battalion
Onward pounding war machine
The hammer battalion Unleashed
Warheads armed with nuclear hate
Using humans as our bait

The order is to kill
Fire at will
The order is to kill
Fire at will
Hammer battalion Unleashed

Smashing through like rabid hounds
Walls they built fall to the ground
Those who oppose is flee or die
Death is marching on our side

The order is to kill
Fire at will
The order is to kill
Fire at will
Hammer battalion Unleashed

Join the battalion!

5. This Day Belongs To Me
Through mist and shadows dim
Stained with life ever so grim
Timeless travails in the utter dark
In the valleys of death i have walked

Now, is my time!

Odin, set me free
This day belongs to me

Face down in piles of human dirt
Endless pain that doesn't hurt
Torn apart yet physically whole
By the filth of man nothing grows

Now, is my time!
Odin, set me free
This day belongs to me

6. Marching Off To War
Free from their boundaries and chains
We march for revenge again
With our legions prepared by our side
To fight, to live and to die
The hour of truth is here
So we rise to the challenge everywhere
Marching off to war
Join or fall!

Behold as we march off to war
Cities shall burn and fall

Nothing can stop us now
By the hammer of Thor they shall bow
For the masters of art have returned
Our enemies' flag will be burned

The hour of truth is here
So we rise to the challenge everywhere
Marching off to war
Join or fall!

Behold as we march off to war
Cities shall burn and fail

7. Entering The Hall Of The Slain
Burning illness deep within
Demons haunt my every breath
All the years in agony
Staring into the eyes of death
....into the eyes of death
The time that was given to me
Alone with the thoughts some would dread
Staring into the eyes of death

Entering the hall of the slain
Entering the hall of the slain

I fear no God
I fear no pain
As my time has come
Entering the hall of the slain

Leave it all behind me now
Soil, wind and fire
No regrets as i bid farewell
Valkyries, come take me higher!
....come take me higher
The hour has struck for me
At the end of my conscious desire
So come, come take me higher....

Entering the hall of the slain
Entering the hall of the slain

I fear no God
I fear no pain
As my time has come
Entering the hall of the slain

Open wide the gates of Valhalla!

8. Black Horizon
Towards a black horizon
Our brothers are avenged, the battle is won
The longships set sail in the night
On the raging sea, with the stars as guide

Thoughts of those we could not sail,
The wounds i received and blows i gave
The darkness before my eyes
The freezing wind that chills my spine

Black Horizon....
Towards the black horizon

The waves that clashes to the side
The hunger and pain i must survive
Still i can feel the smell
Of my enemies blood and hear their cries for help
A glance from an axe blade shines
As memory of those i slayed this time
Long is our voyage at sea
To Birka shores, to the land of the free

Black Horizon....
Towards the black horizon

Thor, give me the strength
Like so many times before
Thor, give me the power
To bring us home to Birka shores
I raise my hammer in honour
Of those who'll never come home
I swear an oath to their fathers
I carve their names in stone

Black Horizon....
Towards the black horizon
Black Horizon....
Towards the black horizon

9. Carved In Stone
Gone, is the black horizon
But not the images of passed time
Dead are the many brave warriors
Who fought by my side
Who fought by my side

Now as i carve the names in stone
Of those who dies so far from home
I mean for these words to bring them pride
As time will pass, their deeds will never die

Accept this gift of eternal remembrance
For the courageous and bold
Thor, give these runes your blessing
As time will unfold
As time will unfold

Now as i carve the names in stone
Of those who dies so far from home
I mean for these words to bring them pride
As time will pass their deeds will never die....

10. Warriors Of Midgard
Politicians and employers
Lack of needed future knowledge
Protectionism is what they grow
Scared to death by the things we know

Never fall into their trap
Never buy their empty crap
Their institutions will fail
Our way of life prevail

The new breed that won't be led
Warriors of Midgard
we define the road ahead
Warriors of Midgard

Society of imitation
No place of innovation
Vassals of conformity
Want to end individuality
It's a zombie's dance all the way
And become just another prey
Their institutions will fail
Our way of life prevail

The new breed that won't be led
Warriors of Midgard
we define the road ahead
Warriors of Midgard
The new breed that won't be led
Warriors of Midgard

11. Midsummer Solstice
Nature stands erected
The season of the Sun
Gather around the stones
The time for blot has come

Light the fires of the north
Bring forth the goblets
A toast to our fortune
To Freya, Frey and fortune

Come lust for ecstasy
Unleash the seal of man
Come lust for ecstasy
It is Midsummer's Eve

Morbid spirits rising
Essence of the night
They sing a song of blasphemy
The demons dance tonight

Light the fires of the north
Bring forth the goblets
A toast to our fortune
To Freya, Frey and fortune

Come lust for ecstasy
Unleash the seal of man
Come lust for ecstasy
It is Midsummer's Eve

12. Home Of The Brave
As Gungir has beed thrown
Over the battle field
Brynhilde chooses her price
Among those with sword and shield

Home of the brave
Home of the brave
Where Odin awaits
Preparing for the final day

In the blood of every warrior
In the heart of honest men
In the souls of those who are dying
There is comfort at the end

Home of the brave
Home of the brave
Where Odin awaits
Preparing for the final day

....home of the brave

Welcome to Valhalla!

13. I Want You Dead
Common man you make me sick with hate
Nothing about you is real
Talk in circles to avoid the truth
All the things you must conceal
Prove your point just once and I'll give in
All the crap you need to say
Point your finger at us, brave like few
Standing safely miles away

I want you dead
I want you dead

Sacred son of yet an ugly bitch
Comprehension ain't your game
Christian looks - it is the look of your face
Lack of knowledge is your name
As i vomit in your general direction
Tears are falling as you flee
Walk the roads without a spark
I'll help you die as charity

I want you dead
I want you dead
So fucking dead

1. A New Day Will Rise
In the far distance
Under an unknown flag
A vast army appears
Will the great war end at last?
Overwhelming power
Hammer battalions on retreat
Overwhelming power
White Christ now flee

Our time will come
A new day will rise

Our time will come
A new day will rise
Our time will come
A new day will rise

Thousands of soldiers
Lying dead in the fields
Fires across the plains
Again the Folklands bleed
We await the return
Of the avanger of Odalheim
Our time will come
A new day will rise

Our time will come
A new day will rise

Our time will come
A new day will rise
Our time will come
A new day will rise
Our time will come
So stand proud...
A new day will rise

(Have faith my warriors
And stand strong, for a new day will rise)

Our time will come
A new day will rise
Our time will come
So stand proud...
A new day will rise

2. They Came To Die
In this cold aftermath
Where the blood has dried at last
Soldiers lay scattered around
In the fields of death, a fading sound

They came to die
They came to die
They came to die

A shameful march without a sound
With weapons pointed at the ground
They came out of the mist
So it all came down to this
Now approaching our lines
Heavens cry, their souls have died
Christ is dead or so it seems
Death before loyalty

They came to die
They came to die
They came to die

In nomine Patris et Filii et Spiritus Sancti
Death before loyalty

They came to die
They came to die
They came to die

In nomine Patris et Filii et Spiritus
They came to die

3. Defenders Of Midgard
Through the dark, dark caves
That was once built
By our fathers determination
Strength and will

But we will rise again
And fight, fight to defend
Our Midgard 'til the very end
Fight to defend
Our Midgard 'til the very end

A time to heal and prepare
For tomorrow
As we march with our minds
Black with sorrow

But we will rise again
And fight, fight to defend
Our Midgard 'til the very end
Fight to defend
Our Midgard 'til the very end

Through the dark, dark caves
That was once built
By our fathers determination
Strength and will

But we will rise again
And fight, fight to defend
Our Midgard 'til the very end
Fight to defend
Our Midgard 'til the very end

Fight to defend
Our Midgard 'til the very end
Fight to defend
Our Midgard 'til the very end

4. Where Is Your God Now?
Here we are alive again
In a battle without end
So we rise from the caves
And march until sol descends

Here we are. Who could tell?
We will all be unleashed from Hel
We will have our revenge
On the soil where our fathers fell

Where is your god now? [4x]

Here we are, but he is gone
The search is on for the sacred one
Hiding out, a cowards game
White Christ in on the run

Here we are. Come out and play
Take his place, die in vain
Or send him out and he shall meet
The bolt thrower on the open plain

Where is your god now? [4x]

Behold the crucifix.
What does it symbolize?
Pallid incompetence
Hanging on a tree

Here we are alive again
In a battle without end
So we rise from the caves
And march until sol descends

Here we are. Who could tell?
We will all be unleashed from Hel
We will have our revenge
On the soil where our fathers fell

Where is your god now? [4x]

5. The Bolt Thrower
He was born of the northern wind
With a spirit of steel, destined to win
A master of war
A master of war that feels no pain
That feels no pain

Forged in the fires of Muspelheim
His will stood the test of time
A master of war that feels no pain
His loyals calling out his name...

The Bolt Thrower
The Bolt Thrower

A master of war
A master of war that feels no pain
That feels no pain

Long was our wait this night
As he called out White Christ to flight
Their time is up, no more hiding in shame
His loyals calling out his name...

The Bolt Thrower
The Bolt Thrower

He was born of the northern wind
With a spirit of steel, destined to win
A master of war that feels no pain
His loyals calling out his name...

The Bolt Thrower
The Bolt Thrower

6. Let The Hammer Fly
Onward into battle now
Fearless rage, gun them down
Some will fight, some will flee
Shoot them dead, watch them bleed

Thor rides his chariot
Rides across the sky
Let the Hammer fly

Kill them all
Leave none alive
Kill them all
Let the Hammer fly

Headless bodies on their knees
Upright as their torsos freeze
Falling down onto the snow
By the firing squads' massive blow
Vengeance now taken for their deeds
In the battle at Uppsala fields
God is still nowhere to be found
Did he flee to higher ground?

Thor rides his chariot
Rides across the sky
Let the Hammer fly

Kill them all
Leave none alive
Kill them all
Let the Hammer fly

Let the Hammer fly, let... the Hammer... fly

(Tyr draws his sword
The Spear of Odin is thrown
Thor rides his chariot
Hel will take her share)

Let the Hammer fly
Kill them all
Leave none alive
Kill them all
Let the Hammer fly

7. Where Churches Once Burned
The battle is over and we march again
Across the northern lands so grand
We take back all that once was given to us
Village by village, land by land
The cross of terror shall be set on fire
And burn like so many times before
Where churches once burned by our fathers' Vengeance
Again, behold the rule of Thor!
...behold the rule of Thor

Where churches once burned
Now behold the rule of Thor!

Ans so we're chasing White Christ off our lands
And burn their churches to the ground
We take back all that once was given to us
And reinstate the Hammer Now!
...reinstate the Hammer now

Where churches once burned
Now behold the rule of Thor!
Where churches once burned
Now behold the rule of Thor!

[Chorus]

8. Land Of The Thousand Lakes
Behind us churches burn to ashes
The quest continues across the Baltic sea
(The Gulf of Bothnia)
To the land of the thousand lakes
Where the forest gives us time to rest and breathe

In a warrior's mind
His father's words from another time

Ride out my son
Ride forth tonight
Warriors so proud
Will fight by your side

We reached the clan of the wilderness
Our forces join in a blot for the dead
Together in the endless war
We speak of the past and what lies ahead

In a warrior's mind
His father's words from another time
Ride out my son
Ride forth tonight
Warriors so proud
Will fight by your side

And defend the helpless ones
So hold your head up high
Stand strong for your kin
And face the world with the nine...

In a warrior's mind
His father's words from another time

Ride out my son
Ride forth tonight
Warriors so proud
Will fight by your side

9. Dawn Of The Nine
Dawn of the nine
Dawn of the nine

I am the fire - The burning hatred towards the unjust (Muspelheim)
I am the light - Driven by passion and lust (Alfheim)
I am life - Nature is my only guide (Vanaheim)
Defender of Midgard, sworn to the nine

Dawn of the nine
Dawn of the nine

I am god - I am my own master and slave (Godheim)
I am the warrior - Courage in my name (Mannheim)
I am the giant - I will crush your world of lice (Jotunheim)
Defender of Midgard, sworn to the nine

Dawn of the nine
Dawn of the nine

I am good and evil - Betray me and you will see (Svartalfheim)
I am death - To all that oppose me (Helheim)
I Am the shadow - The chill down your spine (Nifelheim)
Defender of Midgard, sworn to the nine

Dawn of the nine
Dawn of the nine
Dawn of the nine
Dawn of the nine
Dawn of the nine

10. Welcome The Son Of Thor!
Our ships return to the shores of our Folklands
The sky is blue, a northern wind, it's a day so grand

He has returned!
He has returned!

Welcome the son of Thor!
The new age is born
Welcome the son of Thor!
The new age is born

Warriors standing proud, with raised fists, yelling hails
This is your day of truth, reckoning and prevail
Freedom from fascist Christ, his holiness is forever banned
Hope has now finally come to these forsaken lands

He has returned!
He has returned!

Welcome the son of Thor!
The new age is born
Welcome the son of Thor!
The new age is born

Our time has come
A new day has risen
Our time is now

Welcome the son of Thor!
The new age is born
Welcome the son of Thor!
The new age is born
Welcome the son of Thor!
The new age is born

1. Fimbulwinter
In a time not far from ours
The lasting cold will prevail
The utter darkness will cover all
Nothing will ever be the same
The great ice will lose its grip
Its water will flood the earth
Like an ever flowing stream
Death and rebirth

The Fimbulwinter
The Fimbulwinter
The Fimbulwinter
Come Ragnarök...

Continent by continent
The black storms invade
And destroy everything
That comes in its way

Mother Nature takes back
What's rightfully hers
Ragnarök the liberator
Death and rebirth

The Fimbulwinter
The Fimbulwinter
The Fimbulwinter
Come Ragnarök...

Three years of lasting cold
Three years of darkness

[Repeat chorus]

2. Odalheim
From the ashes of the old world
A new one begin to take form
At the end of the great winter
The new age was born

Black is the dawn
As the new world appears
The air is all silent
We are still here

Rise Odalheim
Rise Odalheim

The winds of the aftermath
Sweeping the shores
Of our ancestor's land
Where we shall build once more

Rise Odalheim
Rise Odalheim

We are the warriors of Midgard
A kindred of mental bloodline
Hammer Battalions of the world
Stand up! This is our time!

Rise Odalheim
Rise Odalheim

Rise Odalheim
Rise Odalheim

We are the warriors of Midgard
A kindred of mental bloodline
Hammer Battalions of the world
Stand up! This is our time!

Rise Odalheim
Rise Odalheim

As the new dawn is rising
The age of the warrior is here
Raise your hammers high
For Odalheim everywhere

3. White Christ
Rape, pillage, burn
As White Christ returns
Women scream in pain
Gutting children is a game

I have seen it before

I see the death
All that is left
Is their blood of lies
And the terror of White Christ

Death is slow
Burned eye sockets glow
With the light of Christ
Shining, oh so bright
Sawed-off limbs fouund
Scattered on the ground
Bodies without heads
Cut off as they fled

I have seen it before

I see the death
All that is left
Is their blood of lies
And the terror of White Christ
The blood of lies
The terror of White Christ

Rulers of the earth
Their message will be heard
Kneel to the cross
All will be lost
Rape, pillage, burn
As White Christ returns
Women scream in pain
Gutting children is a game

I see the death
All that is left
Is their blood of lies
And the terror of White Christ

4. The Hour Of Defeat
Healing the wounds
From the attack
Rest assured they'll be back
Time to prepare
And bury the sorrow
Our retaliation must follow

The hour to defeat, the hour to defeat
Blasting, bursting, will this be our time to retreat?
Blastint, bursting, the hour to defeat

Arming the forces
Now ready to fight
Odin, guide us tonight!
Grand is the view
Of our ships of war
Closing in at enemy shores
Sounding the charge
Fire at will!
The enemy standing still...

All against the odds
Their guns are too great
Outnumbered it is all to late

The hour to defeat, the hour to defeat
Blasting, bursting, the time has come for retreat
Blasting, bursting, the hour to defeat

[Repeat chorus]

5. Gathering The Battalions
Fled the guns blasting death
Through forest, field and sea
Decimated to extinction
The last of our kin yet free

Through a darkened land, once so proud and grand
Gathering the battailons, gathering the battailons

Terror now rule the lands
Where free men one walked
The ALthing council now decides to gather
The battailons of the world to a final war
On the ancient rrails of Norrland
We start journey to be free
Struggling through the Norwegian forest
Raching the coast finally

Through a darkened land, once so proud and grand
Gathering the battailons, gathering the battailons

[Repeat chorus]

6. Vinland
Left the coast of Norway behind
With the vengeance burning in our minds
All determined to return one day
As Soll will shine

Across the open sea, to Vinland and test our steel
Longships towards a black horizon
Like our fathers in the past
We shall have our victory at last

Rubble, chaos, death and decay
Through dead cities on our way
From the east coast to the west
Our forces grow by the day

Across the open sea, to Vinland and test our steel
Longships towards a black horizon
Like our fathers in the past
We shall have our victory at last

[Repeat verse 1 and chorus]

Fearless with swords drawn into battle
Like our fathers in the past
We shall have our victory at last

7. Rise Of The Maya Warriors
Over the mountains we travelled far
Over the sierra madre occidental

We have come to join
The rise of the maya warriors
The rise of the maya warriors

Join the rebellion and the ancient rites
Central america arise
The force of nature will win
Let the drums of war begin

We have come to join
The rise of the maya warriors
The rise of the maya warriors

We have come to join
The rise of the maya warriors
El ascenco de los guerreros mayas
El ascenco de los guerreros mayas

8. By Celtic And British Shores
We shall fight on the seas
We shall fight on the beaches
Disembark and make them flee
We shall never surrender

Rule battailons, battailons rule the waves
Midgard Warriors never will be slaves

We shall fight in the fields
We shall fight in the jills
Marching fast in firm belief
We shall take back what's ours
We shall fight to the last man
We shall fight in the streets
Hunting White Christ off our land
We shall never surrender

Rule battailons, battailons rule the waves
Midgard Warriors never will be slaves

Hammers of Thor held high
We stand victorious, watching our enemies die

[Repeat chorus 2x]

9. The Soil Of Our Fathers
Onward through the land of Gaul
Over the Pyrenees
Warriors are joining our quest
From the desolate cities

We shall struggle and toil
We shall fight again on our father's soil

March my warriors, march!
To reclaim our land
Fight proud my armies, fight!
On our way to the final stand

Gather with the Iberian battailons
Crossing the Ebro river again
Each day our numbers grow
Odin guide us to the very end
Marching to the Roman kingdom
Where the thirteenth legion rule supreme
Our forces now band together
And march against the tyranny

We shall struggle and toil
We shall fight again on our father's soil

March my warriors, march!
To reclaim our land
Fight proud my armies, fight!
On our way to the final stand

[Repeat chorus]

...the final stand

10. Germania
We march across the land
Over the mountains grand
And forests of fire
The black winds of death that sweeps
Through the empty cities
And deserted barbed wire
In this forsaken land
Once ruled by the pagan man
This is the hour!
Here where no life dwells
Where our fathers fell
We'll taje back what is ours

Through Saxon land
For the pagan man
Germania, Germania

Rebuild the Irminsul
Behold the Saxon rule
With reborn glory
Onward through heathen lands
For the pagan man
This is our glory
We shall build again
A kingdom without end
The old rule dying
Our future lies beyond
In history to come
Our dawn is rising

Through Saxon land
For the pagan man
Germania, Germania

[Repeat chorus]

11. The Great Battle Of Odalheim
Our journey has come to an end
The svithiod we have returned 
As Sol descends
On the winter solstice night
Our forces now prepare
For the final fight
A blot to Thor and Odin
As the morning breaks
The battle begins
The battailons of the world
At Uppsala fields
Their call is heard...

This is our world now!!!

The great battle of Odalheim
The great battle of Odalheim

The armies of White Christ
Now fire upon us all
Blitzkrieg light the sky
Warheads that explode

Shreds that burn their way
Into flesh and bone
Men cut in half
Blood rains from the sky
Breaking through enemy lines
Now close to victory
In the great war of our time

The great battle of Odalheim
The great battle of Odalheim

The armies of White Christ
No mercy behind enemy lines 
So close to victory
In the great war of our time

The great battle of Odalheim
The great battle of Odalheim

In the far distance 
Under an unkown flag
A vast army appears...

1. Beyond The Dark Sun
... For years I have traveled in coldness,
But my heart is warm as the darkened sun above me...
Nothing can never take away
What I've seen with these tired eyes

Face of the weeping night
And the shade of the fading light

The dawn will never rise again for my eyes
And I will never sleep again
I've lost my hope time after time
Cause the light has erased from the sky

Now when the darkness has become part of me
I got to let my shadows free
Cause I never looked behind, I never tried to find
Something that could have made me one
Now when the sorrow has taken control of me
I got to let my shadows free
Cause I never looked behind, I never tried to find
Something that could have made me one
Something that I could reach the Sun

2. Winter Madness
Divine creations now destroyed to uncover the haunted atmosphere
Strange visions of the ancient spirits, travesty of man appears
Coldness and the storming winds lurking for prey
The forces of the Winter reign in dreadful way, there's no escape

I'm following the mistress of night
Through the gates of snow we'll fly
We'll fly

Winter - The realm of eternal ice
Snowfall and darkness descends upon the vales of time
Distant caress of the sun's fading light
The lands were painted white with the Winter's might

My hands are frozen, my mind is at the edge of madness
Oh how many nights and days, I've been lost in this land of sadness

From the primitive thoughts, under the glimmering snow
And burning stones - they'll rise -
The artful spirit: "You don't have to die,
You can rule in afterlife, just concede your soul to me,
(your life is cheap) - no price -"

3. Sleeping Stars
Oh sleeping stars, why are you so sad tonight
Oh sleeping stars, will you shine for me tonight
Oh sleeping stars

Can you see them float in the night sky
Can you hear those echoes of their sweet cries, creating a tune
Can you see them shine so bright
Can you feel their loneliness through their cold light, touching you

My eyes feel so heavy when the stars are calling me
- Join with us eternally -
I'm falling in deep trance and my powers are weakening
I'm falling in a world between dreams and reality

I am now alone in the silent light
And there's nothing but darkness around me
Deeper into unknown the strange light is guiding me
Wake me until it's too late

Suddenly I feel a warmth go through my body
But I feel that a part of me has died, I sense the change in me
I must have been away so long
So please stay with me for a while

4. Battle Against Time
... I'm sailing away to undiscovered seas...

I see a golden light shining far away
I can't tell if I'll make it there someday
I reach my hands but there's no one on my path
I can't sleep 'cause my body is burning
Cold sweat, cannot breath, I'm loosing my mind
Reflection in the mirror shows a different man at night
And as hours and seconds pass by
I feel my every feeling wither and die
Do I really feel this pain
'cause sometimes I can't tell if I'm awake

Watching to the night, the hope is gone
Carrying so much burden in my heart
Watching to the night with tired eyes
Waiting for nothing all my life

Battle against time
I... battle against time

I am covered with cold ice, I am flying in the black skies
Fighting everyday, but it feels like, it's just the same
Oh time... you cut my heart and soul
You carve my will and passion of life
'cause the days of emptiness are piercing through me like arrows

I feel nothing, but hate and love
So much fire inside, so much left undone
Hate&Love

... I'm sailing away and nothing will ever be the same...

5. Death And The Healing
A windstorm dropped a bird from the sky
It fell to the ground and it's wings broke and died
But when the time got by, back to sky it flied
'cause the wings healed in time and the bird was I

Time is the death and the healing
Take your last breath, 'cause death is deceiving
Time is the past, now and tomorrow
Days fly so fast and it leaves me so hollow

A snowstorm blew inside a wolf's eyes
And the frozen tears covered all the mountainsides
But then the time got by and the wolf died
And someday that wolf would be I

6. Starchild
[Part I (Wanderer of Time)]

So mysterious is your world,
Concealed beyond the stars
Far away from the earth,
It flows one with time and dark as the night
Million shapes and colours
Are storming inside your mind
Creating endless dimensions
Forming universes without walls

Let go! of the stars, the stars that fell into the sea
Let go! of your thoughts and dreams,
What can you see now

You cannot save them anymore
- Wanderer of time -
It's too late now
- Creator of Dimensions -
Destroy the walls of time
Hands of the blind are holding your fate
Tides of life will take you away, will take you away

Starchild!
Visions are born from the unknown force
It dominates the way of time
The dream only ends, when the worlds come to an end
Starchild!
You cannot escape to the dark streams of the sea,
To suppress your dreams
Nothing can keep you away from the need to create
'cause your path is free...

[Part II (Burning Star)]

I've hold the fire within myself
Years I've walked in the coldest winds
Through the deserts of sand and snow
The time is passing and I know;
That I'm wasting my life, destroying my dreams
I'm diving into the bottomless sea
From sorrow and pain I find my strength
The more pain I feel, the more I see
Now I'm watching my life flowing in the dark
Like streams of fear running through my heart
And it's wearing me down until I'm gone
Soon I'll join the endless whirls of stars
And I fall (something is dying, yet something is born)
deeper into the unknown voids
And I fall (when will I find my silent dawn)
into infinity like a burning star
I fall like a burning star!

[Part III (The Creation)]

The curtains of mist are fading
And the veils of star clouds are revealed
Storms of new energy
Flows in the depths of my mind
New constellations are born
In total harmony of perfection
And the dissonant unbalance was broken
As the colours fell straight from the light

[Part IV (The Sea of Stars)]

I'm floating in the sea of stars,
I'm drifting away from the shore
I will be lost in the dream when the dark days come
But I will make the time run backwards and
I'll make the stars shine again
I will light up the sky to a bright crimson nights
... And they'll shine together forever
With brilliant silver colours they'll shine forever

[Part V (Finale)]

The whirls of stars takes you now far away
Away from the cold nightmare
Let go of you thoughts and dreams
And you will feel the warmth once again
Starchild! in the Sea of Stars you fall
You fall like a burning star!
Starchild! in the Sea of Stars you fall
... But there is no end to creation

7. Beautiful Death
My face turned pale before the cold eyes of death
My body was frozen by the stare from the dark
I don't want to think of anything but this storm of thoughts in my head
I wasn't prepared for this, 'cause I'm not ready to die
Nothing could have prepared me for this
[backwards:] Only way out is through window of dreams

Nothing but blood so red and deceased
Nothing but pain, I fall on my knees
Tormenting demons, I suffer and bleed
Only way out is through window of dreams

The rain whips the lonely and crushed soul
The dark clouds are closing fast, the wind is blowing the colours of life away
The growing shadow will darken my dreams, and with the fire inside me it feeds
I'll be screaming in the stars when it's over
Storms are raging on the path to home, once so silent and calm
The desperate glare of the dark light is cast on the fallen one
And when the illusions sigh no more, the journey to new dream will carry on
'Cause life is just a beautiful death

Life turns a new and strange page
They will try to take everything away from me
You'll never know the future
Save me from the rain
Tell me what matters in life, if anything
I'm struggling with sickness
They will try to take everything away from me
Are you trying to hide from the end
Save me from the rain
Save me from the end

'Cause life will always be withering away from us
I want to be alone with you
And I'll give my heart to you, before I go
'Cause life is just a beautiful, beautiful death

8. Sadness And Hate
Sad night, the weeper of starwind sky
Take me where the shimmering lights are fading out
Through the shadows of hate and through the fires of grace
I followed the voice in the night, beautiful as black sky,
But nothing I found

My thoughts are captured by the magical chants
Of the spirits, but I cannot see them with these dead eyes
Lost I am in these dismal streams
Lost I am forever in my life

The snow is falling on the withering leaves, I am left in the cold
The shadows are crying in the moonlight
Is this night the last of my life

Have we arrived from our journey, I must ask you now
At last I can cry, 'cause these sad words are calling me tonight
My eyes bleed for you my star, my pride and the love of my heart
But why did you had to fly so far, I raged and it tore me apart
I promise to you with sadness and hate
Wherever I might go, you will know...

I give my life to the withering leaves
To the bleeding moonlight
To the crying shadows
I GIVE MY LIFE TO YOU

Behold the rain of stars - The awakening of darkened skies
Falling from the dark - The symphony of dying lights
Behold the rain of stars - The blazing fire came pouring down
Falling from the dark - And life and death became unbound
Sons of winter and stars - Rise!
Sons of winter and stars - Rise!
Sons of winter and stars! Rise! Rise!
Fly with us through the darkness
Sons of winter and stars! Rise! Rise!
And we shall embrace the stars
And we shall open the doors of time

[II Surrounded By Darkness]

I have awaken the darkness
Taste the fear! Taste the pain!
I am the one who seeks vengeance
Into the darkness we fly
Into the shadows they hide
Into the darkness we fly
They will never survive, they ́ll die
Oh they will die!
I sacrifice everything, just for one moment
I throw away everything that matters to me the most
I ́m flying through the darkness
The fire casts a shadow on me
I tear a part of my heart for creation of dimensions
And we fly beyond the restless shadows
We fly beyond the stars
We fly beyond the birth of the worlds
So old I ́ve become - Thousand years staring into emptiness
But now I realize - That it was just an illusion
All this time I thought it was you that would save the sun
Oh rain comes and washes the hate away
Now I am at the crossroads with questions
Somewhere, someday I will find what I am here for
Who am I

[III Journey Inside A Dream]

I ́m wondering now where will you take me
From the horizon the light comes alive
Into the mountains high we set our way
Will we find our way in this long winter night
I see the land of fading sun and rising mountains
And I finally feel that I ́ve found my home
But oh, how it feels so cold when my dreams wither in fragments of time
Revealing that this land will die
Before the winds so cold
The world was shattered in the fragments of time
Before the autumn rains
The coldness will again awake
Falling snow, so soft and cold
Dying moon cast down so weak
Frozen lake, the dancing spirits
Calling me to join in the cosmic dream
The silence is tempting me now...

[IV Sons Of Winter And Stars]

We are the Sons of Winter and Stars
We ́ve come from a far beyond time
Forever the fire burns in our hearts
Our world shall never die
In the arms of the wind we ride till dawn
As the waves of the ocean grind so strong
We wander in the stars until we ́re gone
Our fate is sealed by eternal sun
Until we fade away - Fate will find it ́s way
Until we drift into the dark
It ́s not too late to find a way - Fate will find it ́s way
And fly in cold embrace of stars
Mysteries of time
Unfolding in cosmic dreams
Leaving life and death meaningless
Before the revelation of infinity
Embrace the stars!
The energy flows in me like a river of stars
I ́m surrounded by the circle of fire, but eternal ice has frozen my heart
I ́m lost in the pathways of time
But now the time has come for us!
We are the Sons of Winter and Stars!

3. Land Of Snow And Sorrow
Far away there ́s a land of snow and sorrow

Time has made the frozen tears fall like rain from the starlit sky
And I feel so cold, I can ́t make it tomorrow
Oh, but the night will see where this path will lead my life
Endless field of snow at the edge of the world and the wailing
Winds so cold scar my face, I ́m going insane
I am lost from the light - And the memories follow me in the night
I ́m left in the arms of winter and I am carried far away - Far away
Night is falling over my home
The land of snow and sorrow, oh carry me away from the cold
And I fall asleep, I will dream the last dream
All I was, is gone now and sorrow is all I feel
And the white snow is falling from the starlit sky
And the stars are shining like your eyes
You are so beautiful
And I will follow them in this cold winter night
So I ́d find my way to you this time
Drifting away from the warmth of the darkness
Caressed by the light of a million stars
The darkness will always be a part of my heart
Until I ́m carried away by the winter ́s arms
Night is falling over my home
The land of snow and sorrow, oh carry me away from the cold
And I fall asleep and I will not be afraid
All I was, is gone now and sorrow is all I feel

4. Darkness And Frost
[Instrumental]
5. Time
Darkness and frost are starting to reach
The heart of this land with a cold disease
Sleep now for a while before the storm awakes
And one day it will reward you for the burden of wait
The roots go deep into the frozen dead ground
Listen to the land of snow, it makes no sound
For ages searching the warmth of the sun
If it never finds me, I can die as one
Time will go on and we are drifting away in the night
I ́ve been searching so long, but I will find you even if it takes my whole life
But tonight I feel so alone and I know that you are forever gone
Oh time, don ́t fade away when I need you here, oh please don ́t leave me now
TIME!
Time! Fades away!
When time fades away!
And I ́ll never be the same
Time! Time! Time! Time!
You want so much from me - I feel nothing but grief and despair
How can I make you feel again - All my dreams are just visions I can ́t bear
You want something that I can ́t give - I cannot keep living in this bitter dream
And I don ́t care anymore
It feels like my life is ending
Oh, another year gone by
But nothing has changed in my life
And time goes on forever and ever
And it waits for no one
Time fades away
And I fade away
And I ́ll never be the same
TIME! Fades away!
When time fades away!
And I ́ll never feel the same
And I fade away!
When time fades away!
And I ́ll never feel the same

1. Awaken From The Dark Slumber (Spring)
[Part I The Dark Slumber]

Beneath the murky soil
The draw of the ancient spell
Swallowing everything in the ground
And then there was no sound

Twisting the roots of life
Distorting the obscure shapes
The day was creeping into night
And then there was no light

The mist was rolling from the mountains
Creatures were crawling under the ground
The darkness fell from the sky
And then there was no life

The spell was too strong
Too weak to resist its pull
The wind was frozen still as I took my last breath
But then there was no death

The days turned into years
The years turned into eternity
The natural order was twisted into dark harmony
Dark dark harmony

I created my own fears
The mist of sorrow encircled my thoughts
The demons came forth from the shadows bringing dark disease
Dark dark disease

With a sudden roar the ground trembled and cried
As the fire burned a hole in the sky
The light was swallowed into the ground and the colors were broken in the night
And all the stars' creations were left to die

Now! Let the dark disease wipe out all the living
Oh! And let all the lands be filled with silence
In the night´s cold embrace you left me astray
And the hope of new life fades away
Now! Let all the lands be covered in black snow
Will the morning sun ever rise again
And let all the creatures of the forest turn into stone
The slow demise has begun
Will this be forever

[Part II The Awakening]

From the realms below we ride
And in terror they run and hide
From the shadows of old we rise
Awaken from the dark - from the dark slumber

Over the ancient ruins we fly
Where the old kings go to die
And new kingdoms rising high
Awaken from the dark dark slumber

Awaken from the dark - from the dark slumber
Awaken from the dark dark slumber

Rise!

Creatures of the dawn
Crawling from the depths of the frozen earth
As the shadows were twisting and turning beneath the sun

The sound of the moaning beasts
Blaring through the forest
As they´re roaming wild beneath the morning sun

Ride! Ride with us again!
Fight! And live as free men!
Die! And be born again!

Ride! Ride!
Ride with us again!
Fight! Fight!
And live as free men!
Die! Die!
And be born again!

Die and be born again!

Centuries in darkness
Bound to ruthless ice and snow
As the dawn of the new world rises, we shall be free

By the fire we live and die
And the light of the sun fills our eyes
From the fire beyond the ancient stars we are born

From the realms below we ride
And in terror they run and hide
From the shadows of old we rise
Awaken from the dark - from the dark slumber

Over the ancient ruins we fly
Where the old kings go to die
And new kingdoms rising high
Awaken from the dark dark slumber

Awaken from the dark - from the dark slumber

As the old worlds fall behind
Our spirit reaches wide
With no fear breathing new life
Awaken from the dark dark slumber

2. The Forest That Weeps (Summer)
I am the mist in the morning
I am the moss in the ground
You are the light that cuts through the stone

I am the worms in the dirt
I am the branches reaching the sky
You are the source, the orchestrator of life

In the dark rain the grey mountains sing
A sad song of winter and the howling wind
Visions of the past in the haunting dreams
Under the dead sky, under the withered trees

The night falls upon the forest that weeps
Father of shadows that forever sleeps

I saw the lakes that shimmer
I heard the clanging of the wild rivers
You are the voice that carries throughout the land

I felt the strength of my ancestors
As I walked through the land of the dead
You are the fire that burns forever

In the dark rain the grey mountains sing
A sad song of winter and the howling wind
Visions of the past in the haunting dreams
Under the dead sky, under the withered trees

The night falls upon the forest that weeps
Father of shadows that forever sleeps

In the dark rain the grey mountains sing
A sad song of winter and the howling wind
Visions of the past in the haunting dreams
Under the dead sky, under the withered trees

The night falls upon the forest that weeps
Father of shadows that forever sleeps

3. Eternal Darkness (Autumn)
[Part I Haunting Darkness]

Haunting darkness forming inside of man
Calling to return the blood of the earth
Baleful shadows gathering under the blackened sky
Reversing the evolution of the forbidden birth

Devastation of the hollow universe
Executed by wrath and absolute power
Completion of the perfect chaos
The pure destruction of stars

I am the immortal shadow
The ruler of dark dimensions
Behold my crimson nightmare
I am the creator of sorrow
Tormentor in the restless night
I am the hunter of fear, the bringer of despair
I am death
I am eternal darkness

[Part II The Call of the Dark Dream]

Unleash the dark dream, the essence of deception
The fantasy of life will blind you like the flaming sun
The clash of the opposite worlds
The cosmic war of the unnatural state has begun

Embrace the suffering and prepare for transcendent attack
Obliterate the memories and smother the past
And face the unknown! And face the unknown!

Hear the call of the final journey
Hear the call!
Hear the call of the dark dream
Calling from across the stars of old
Hear the call!
Hear the call of the dark dream

[Part III Beyond the Infinite Universe]

Wandering among the stars... Searching...
Beyond the infinite universe...
Tearing down the structures...
But I can only see darkness...

Caressed by the radiant ocean
Soaring high in the waves of sadness
Obsessed by the deepest emotions
Lost in the beautiful silence
Oh the beautiful silence!

Fall!
Falling through the layers of mind
Fall!
As the world is crumbling before my eyes
Falling through the caustic vortex
And my heart is burning by the ultimate lie
The ultimate lie!

[Part IV Death]

There is no end
There is no beginning
There is no truth
There is only darkness

And I curse you into oblivion!

I curse you for fulfilling your every desire
I curse you for your wild and relentless inner fire
Curse you for your need to breed and multiply
Curse you for your consciousness
The feeble rebellion
The great illusion
The cosmic war

I am the immortal shadow
The ruler of dark dimensions
Behold my crimson nightmare
I am the creator of sorrow
Tormentor in the restless night
I am the hunter of pain, the bringer of rain
I am death
I am eternal darkness

I am eternal
I am death

4. Loneliness (Winter)
Once I saw the light in your eyes
But nothing will be any longer the way I remember
I've become someone else and I can't go back, I tried
I'm lost in the fields of snow far from home

Follow the coast under the frozen sky
With a growing sorrow in weary eyes
Swallow the ghost of the lucid dream
And silent will be the mournful sea

The sands of life covered in white
From the darkest nights to the blinding light
I almost reached home, I was so close
But to be left alone is what hurts the most

Am I the only one awake
Am I the one who is fading away
There was so much I wanted to say
Do I have a reason anymore to stay

Washed away by the morning sun
Hear the howling call from the other side
And so much was left undone
The weight of the world quietly crushed the dying light
Washed away by the frozen stars
Feel the burning coldness of the falling snow
And one day when everything is gone
The trail in the snow disappears, am I finally home
