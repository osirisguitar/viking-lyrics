The wait is soon at end
Always charge, never bend
Morning is here, make your stand
Live for honor, glory, death in fire!

Total war is here
Face it without fear
Age of sword, age of spear
Fight for honor, glory, death in fire!

See the fire rise
Flames are raging high
Soon all will burn and die
Burn for honor, glory, death in fire!

Storm of lethal flames
Only death remains
Ragnarok is closing in
Die for honor, glory, death in fire!

Forces of chaos is on the move
Everyone, choose your side
And know the end is coming soon
The day for all to die

The day is here when Bifrost breaks
Nor sun or moon will rise
When the dead rise from their graves
And Surtur spreads his fire

All you know will wither away
And sink into the sea
A new world will be born one day
Where everyone is free

[Lead Söderberg]

Total war is here,
Face it without fear
Age of sword, age of spear
Fight for honor, glory, death in fire!

Storm of lethal flames
Only death remains
Ragnarok is our fate
Die for honor, die for glory
Die, death in fire!


2. For The Stabwounds In Our Backs


Silently we bide our time
Soon we'll pay you back
For all the wrongs you've done our kind
For the stabwounds in our backs

You think you're safe. Well, live your lie
There's no way you'll escape
The day that all things living die
The day we rise again

Then Fenris' father will summon us
And we will rise from the death
One million warriors with foaming mouths
To challenge life itself

A horrid ship of dead men's nails
Will bring our ranks ashore
The eastern wind will fill our sails
And your son will hold the oar

You think you're safe. Well, live your lie
There's no way you'll escape
The day that all things living die
The day we rise again

Our rusty swords will never rest
So send the best you've got
Into our grinning jaws of death
We'll make their suffering short

So sit there on your golden throne
Soon we will arise
Time for vengeance is coming soon
The time for all to die!


3. Where Silent Gods Stand Guard


The last head falls to the ground
No one is left alive
They thought that they could take me down
But it's not my time to die

I wipe the blood from my sword
And slide it in my belt
This is the sweetest of rewards
The best rush I have felt

Ten men are dead by my feet
I smell their streaming blood
And I smile, cause it makes me...
...makes me feel so good

They were crawling on their knees
Begging for their pathetic lives
Now their souls belong to me
As well as their eyes

Each man has something that I crave
I eat their steaming eyes
And drink their blood to make them my slaves
At Oden's feat in afterlife

I bring the skulls to my shrine
Where silent Gods stand guard
Soak them in blood and in wine - A sacrificial ritual

One thousand heads are on display
Collected through years of thirst
Macabre trophies from my prey
Picked clean of flesh by Oden's birds

I am - I am - A wolf in human shape
I am - I am - A predator with flaming rage

[Lead Mikkonen]

I'm a wolf in human shape - Every man is prey
A predator with flaming rage - Blood is in my trace

I will die with sword in hand
And then my seat's secured
When Oden calls from golden hall
He will greet me at the door


4. Vs The World


One we were scum of the Earth
Now we've cleared our names
In Nifelheim came rebirth
Baptized in Mount Doom's flames

A decade now we've fought this war
Never yielding from our path
Our journeys take us to foreign shores
Where we let our metal blast

We've been battered and left for dead
We've been beaten and we have bled
But we always made it through - Vs the world
This may be our last quest
Before we're put to rest
The end is coming soon - Vs the world

Warriors of the grave took us south
Hell bent on genocide
They made us face the brutal truth
This would be no easy ride

Grotesque creatures of the sky
Met with us on winter fields
Christian god cast aside - Massacre of hallowed eve

We've been battered and left for dead
We've been beaten and we have bled
But we always made it through - Vs the world
This may be our last quest
Before we're put to rest
The end is coming soon - Vs the world

Persian demons brought us south
On merciless campaign
We've raided the western shores
Always going against the grain

All these years we've fought to win
And sometimes almost died
I tell you now we won't give in
Without a vicious fight

We've been battered and left for dead
We've been beaten and we have bled
Versus the world


5. Across The Rainbow Bridge


My days are numbered: soon I have to leave
The Norns have stretched my living thread
The notion of my demise won't leave me be
Why cannot death just set me free!

I've lived a life or prosperity
But I'm not as young as I used to be
Down the road waits misery
Why cannot death just set me free!

Countless armies have I attacked
Not once have I backed down
And though I've spilled a lot of blood
I never once received a mortal wound

I've raided shores in many lands
I cannot count the men I've killed
So many friends died with sword in hand
But the warrior's death was never granted me

I dress myself in battle clothes
Alone I make the final ride
My sight is blurred, by whipping snow
I seek to end my life

I want to walk across the Rainbow Bridge
And see my fathers in the golden hall
They beckon me to join their feast
In my dreams I hear their call


6. Down The Slopes Of Death


Down the slopes of death he rides
The eight hooves pound like drums
Darkness reigns the crumbling sky
Invasion has begun

Fields of flames greets his eye
He smells the fear and pain
Of dying men in agony
It can drive a man insane

All enemies flee his spear
No bow nor axe do harm
Allfather rides out on fields of fear
When Heimdal sounds the alarm

But on the field waits his fate
Foretold in ancient times
A beast with sharp yellow teeth
And hateful burning yes

Today he'll draw his final breath
The wisest God of all
His son will avenge his death
Iormundr's brother will fall

He knows now what is to come
No use to try and run
What is to be, let it be done!
What is to be, let it be done!

Today he'll draw his final breath
The wisest God of all
His son will avenge his death
Iormundr's brother will fall

Down the slopes of death he rides
The eight hooves pound like drums
Darkness reigns the crumbling sky
Invasion has begun

Down the slopes of death he rides
The eight hooves pound like drums
Darkness reigns the crumbling sky
No more is the sun


7. Thousand Years Of Oppression


He hung on the windswept world tree
Whose roots no one knows
For nine whole days he hung there pierced
By Gugnir, his spear

Swimming in pain he peered into the depths
And cried out in agony
Reaching out he grasped the runes
Before falling back from the abyss

He gave himself unto himself
In a world of sheering pain
So that we all may live our lives
By the wisdom that he gained

You doubted him, and spread their lies
Across the world, with sword in hand
You raped our souls, and stole our right
All for the words of mild-mannered man

You listened to mild-mannered god
And put your faith in deceitful words
Your powertrip was paid by blood
In kindness' name you spilled our blood

I refuse to submit
To the god you say is kind
I know what's right, and it is time
It's time to fight, and free our minds

Let me die without fear!
As I have lived without it
So shut your mouth and spare my ears
I'm fed up with all your bullshit

After a thousand years of oppression
Let the berserks rise again
Let the world hear these words once more:
"Save us, oh lord, from the wrath of the Norseman"

Our spirits were forged in snow and ice
To bend like steel forged over fire
We were not made to bend like reed
Or turn the other cheek

He grasped the runes, they're ours to use


8. Bloodshed


Midgard's cold and hatred reigns
Hunger and disease
Fenris is set free again
Chaos is unleashed

The storm of death sweeps the shores
Famine sweep the land
Ties of kinship is no more
Sons die by their father's hand

Two men meet on battleground
Their eyes are full of hate
By sacred oaths both are bound
Death will be their fate

They share the blood of once proud men
Yet foes they have become
One fights for truth, the other for faith
Perish has begun

Here comes the - Bloodshed
It's the age of - Bloodshed
Here comes the - Bloodshed
It's the age of - Bloodshed

Two brothers meet in battle heat
Both will die to day
No victory and no defeat
Death is their only way

In their eyes is no remorse
They make their final charge
Thrusting their swords with mortal force
Piercing each other's hearts

[Lead Mikkonnen]

Here comes the - Bloodshed
It's the age of - Bloodshed
Here comes the - Bloodshed
Prepare for - Bloodshed


9. ...And Soon The World Will Cease To Be


The Northern wind brings snow and ice
Humans starve and freeze
The Fimbul winter has arrived
And soon the world will cease to be

Brother will be brother's bane
No one shall be spared
All will die. None remain
That is mankind's share

The southern sphere is set ablaze
Muspel's fire is set free
The sun is on its final chase
And soon the world will cease to be

Across the western sky he runs
A wolf so grim and mean
Devours the eternal sun
And soon the world will cease to be

The North Star falls from the sky
Into the deep cold sea
The first of all to fall and die
And soon the world will cease to be

Muspel's flames lick the sky
Hidhægg eats the dead
The Aesir meet in hall up high
And Oden 'quests Mimer's head

Land is swallowed by the waves
Rocks and mountains break
Dead men on the path to Hell
And Yggdrasil quakes

[Lead Mikkonnen]

From the East comes a ship
Loke holds the oar
A demon army with swords that rip
Will join the final war

The army of the dead arrives
Heimdal blows his horn
Calling Gods out to die
Before the world can be reborn


10. Siegreicher Marsch (Victorious March)


[Bonus track]

Zehn schwere Stiefel
ber Grund blutgetränkt
Im Gleichschritt marschieren
Diese fìnf Krieger

Es ist Ihnen gleich
Wie sehr Ihre Wunden
Von feindlichen Schwertern geschlagen
Bis auf die Knochen schmerzen

Die herbeigesehnte Rache
Begangen in Blut
Keine Gnade gezeigt
Keine Gnade gezeigt

Den Schmerz verleugnend
Der wie ein Hammer pocht
Erlitten durch Stìrze
Von erschlagenen Pferden

Kein Anschein von Schwäche
Noch Behutsamkeit
Nicht einmal ein Funke
Von Reue in Ihren Augen

Sie erschlugen die Männer
Nährten Wölfe mit Fleisch
Und jetzt verlassen Sie
Dieses Land Seite an Seite

Jetzt auf dem Heimweg
Fìnf Krieger die ohne Reue kämpften
Diese Geschichte von fìnf tapferen Männern
Wird ewiglich erzählt werden

Nur das Leid bleibt
Nur den Frauen allein
Die Kinder wehklagen
Von nun an lebend in Furcht

Kein Mann bleibt verschont
Kein Haus kein Hof verblieb
Keine Christin ungeschändet
Ihre Kirche von Flammen verzehrt

Rot scheint Ihr Stahl
Von Feindesblut
Erzählend vom Sieg
Der von den Göttern geschenkt

Als Sie wiederkehren
Blutend doch stolz
Brennt der Horizont
Und das Lied erklingt laut

[English translation:]

Ten heavy feet
Walks the bloodsoiled ground
With rhythm these
Five warriors march

No matter how much
The bleeding wounds
From enemy swordcuts
Hurts to the bone

The revenge they sought
Was taken in blood
No mercy was showed
No mercy was showed

They ignore the pain
That hammerlike pounds
From falls, off slain
Horses, to the ground

No signs of weakness
No signs of weariness
Not even a glimce
Of remorse in their eyes

They slew men ruthless
Fed the wolves with flesh
And now they leave
This land side by side

Now they're headed home
Five swordsmen who fought repentlessly
Their story will be told
Of five brave men endlessly

All sorrow is left
For the woman to bare
The children cries
They live in fear

No man was spread
No houses or farm remains
No christian woman unraped
Their church consumed by flames

Their steel shines red
With enemy blood
It sings of victory
Granted by the Gods
And as they return
Bleeding but proud
The horizon burns
And the song is ringing loud
