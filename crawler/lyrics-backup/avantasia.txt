2. Reach Out For The Light
[Gabriel]
Lord above - why don't you tell me
why I'm here in agony?
I've been serving, I've been praying
now I'm caught in misery.

I've been praised by friar Jakob,
I misused his confidence.
Cheated by this work of evil - 
feigning Anna's innocence.

Oh what have I done?
So many ways lead to the fallen one,
Lucifer, fallen light...
Oh what have I done?
What is going on?

We should bring salvation,
not give in to his temptation - no!
Read and preach the holy world
and no forbidden lies that hurt.
I remember words of "seven".
Set me bree - sanity!

[Lugaid]
Reach out for the light
far beyond confines.
You have read the magic lines
leading to the light in your mind...

[Gabriel]
What is right and what is wrong now?
Is it a trial of paradise?

Is anna a witch or do they stick to an error?
What's the book and the seal inside?

Am I a cleric or maybe a sinner? 
Unbeliever? Renegade?
Was it the devil who led me to "seven"?
Oh redeemer is it all too late?

Oh, what have I done?
I have been led by the smelling one,
Lucifer, fallen light...
Tell me stranger, what have I done?
Oh what's going on?

We should bring salvation,
not give in to his temptation - no!
Read and preach the holy world
and no forbidden lies that hurt.
I remember words of "seven".
Set me free - sanity!

[Lugaid]
Reach out for the light
far beyond confines.
You have read the magic lines
leading to the light in your mind...

[Gabriel]
In your mind?

3. Serpents In Paradise
[Gabriel]
Reading the madness they took her away
under the cross.
Bailiff and bishop and monk -
Malleus Maleficarum - the law

Prayed for salvetion, I fought for her soul -
scared by the horned.
The devil was creeping around
until she died in the flames as he saw.

Father forgive me for I've hardly seen
the human deep within. Just an intention -
so holy and clear - paving the way to madness
for us...

Serpents on the way to paradise -
dying for love, fighting for ages.
Serpents on their way to paradise -
raging with anger and pain for the cross.

[Jakob]
Father forgive me for what I have done.
For I betrayed the one that I loved like a son.
Demons and spells are they reality?

The pest and the schism; the power of the Moor
We've got to fight. Keep our people afraid...
Keep them away from what they shall not see.

I see a menace to our paradise
in these evil times.
Heaves is burning, people are yearning
for a new doctrine, they are...

[Gabriel]
Serpents on the way paradise.

[Jakob]
Don't know they'll end in final damnation.

[Gabriel]
Serpents on the way to paradise...

[Jakob]
Raging with anger and pain against the cross.

[Gabriel]
Lord if I'm an unbeliever - what do I believe?
Can you tell me lord what you had done
if you were me?
I have stared into the eyes
of innocence and fear.
I saw Anna in the tower in a lake of tears.
Something strange is going on and
still I don't know why.
I have stared into the secrets
they still try to hide.

Vandroiy can you tell me what you know about it all?
Vandroiy can you help me
to leave this prison hall?
Vandroiy can you help me
free Anna from the chain?
Vandroiy can you help me
to become a little sane?

Serpents on the way to paradise -
Dying for love, fighting for ages.
Serpents on their way to paradise
Raging with anger and pain...

4. Malleus Maleficarum
[Falk von Kronberg]
So, daughter of the old evil spirit, you still pretend
you don't know? Maybe we have a way to make you remember...

[Else Vogler]
I have done no wrong, blood shall come upon you!

[Falk von Kronberg]
Torturer, pull on!

5. Breaking Away
[Lugaid]
Don't wait my friend. We better don't think twice.
Time to fell the prison guard you gotta realize:
No turning back again. Therefor it's all too late...
New horizons wait...

I know the time has come
te leave your past behind.
And now the time has come
to stop them controlling your mind.

[Gabriel]
Breaking away!
All we can do now is break away.
Otherwise she will be dying
while both of us are lying here in chains.

Breaking away!
All we can do now is break away!
Oh - otherwise she will be dying
while both of us are lying here in chains.

Always been a novice in quest for paradise.
Hope they will forgive me for I apostatize.
I can't be no hypocrite, can't wear a masquerade...
New horizons wait...

[Lugaid and Gabriel]
And now the time has come to go another way.
To learn for life and to grow ripe
and prevent the decay...

[Gabriel]
Breaking away!
All we can do now is break away.
Otherwise she will be dying
while both of us are lying here in chains.

Breaking away!
All we can do now is break away!
Oh - otherwise she will be dying
while both of us are lying here in chains.

Breaking away!
It is so hard to lay down what I've been.
But I must go even if my way leads to Hades...

Breaking away!
All we can do now is break away.
Otherwise she will be dying
while both of us are lying here in chains.

Breaking away!
All we can do now is break away!
Oh - otherwise she will be dying
while both of us are lying here in chains.

6. Farewell
[Gabriel]
Days had come, winters had gone,
and we gamboled like siblings in Paradise.
I was your knight, holding you tight
as a brother when I saw your crying eyes.
Time went by and we had to say goodbye.

Staring up to the clouds above
Children - so little and sad.
Hoping the saints could help one day
Lead us together again.
Holding the key to the alley of dreams
still in hands.

Time telling me to say farewell
but I knew that I would fight hell
and I knew: We will
go for another time we can see,
for another time we'll be free,
for no more farewell.

[Anna]
Stepbrother tell me where have you been
when they brought me to this godforsaken place.
Sign of the cross - they took me away
for healing with herbs by the way of grace.
Now I wait for the day to feed the flames.

[Gabriel]
I have been caught in a cage of despair.
My heart as a monk's cell so empty and bare.
But no holy water can make me
forget you again...

Time telling me to say farewell
but I knew that I would fight hell
and I knew: We will
go for another time we can see,
for another time we'll be free,
for no more farewell.

[Lugaid]
No farewell could be the last one.
If you long to meet again...

7. The Glory Of Rome
[Falk]
Jesus Christ I'm coming - terrestrial home.
I'm allowed to guide their train
to visit you in Rome.
I am sick of preachers telling to be plain
while you got it nice in here.
They'd better feel ashamed.

[Johann Adam von Bicken]
Oh, ways of gold
lead is into Your blaze of fame.
Oh, are You waiting
for what we have brought You from hell?

[Gabriel]
Glory of Rome, glorious home.
Praising the king of the kings.
Glory of Rome, glorious home.
Reaching for haloes and wings.

[Johann Adam von Bicken]
Heading for the angels, heading for the feast,
heading for salvation and the ruin of the beast.
Let us fight the outcast, let us brin 'em fire,
let us lock the center of their wicked, mad desire.

Oh, ways of gold lead us into Your blaze of fame.
Oh, are You waiting
for what we have brought You from hell?

[Gabriel]
Glory of Rome, glorious home.
Praising the king of the kings.
Glory of Rome, glorious home.
Reaching for haloes and wings.

[Pope Clemens IIX]
Holding in my hand: Seven parts of a seal
to unlock the land of illumination I feel.
And it's been foretold: after touching the light
we shall lock the world.
But now it's our time to transcend,
the ultimate key in our hand.

[Gabriel]
Glory of Rome, glorious home.
Praising the king of the kings.
Glory of Rome, glorious home.
Reaching for haloes and wings.

8. In Nomine Patris
[instrumental]

9. Avantasia
[Gabriel]
Open my eyes
and see my bleeding wounded hands...
Feeling the pain too hard to stand. To stand...
Caught in the 'now and here'
while they are on the way.
Hiding imagination, leading us astray...

[Lugaid]
Use your mind!
You will leave the flesh dimensions behind.
Sanity can be the toll -
leading to the core of your soul.

[Gabriel and the voices in his head]
We are the power inside, we bring you fantasy.
We are the kingdom of light and dreams,
gnosis and life: Avantasia!
We are the power inside, we bring you fantasy.
We are the kingdom of light and dreams,
gnosis and life: Avantasia! - Avantasia...

Walking along the icy gallery of pain.
Tell me now: What can keep the flame alive?
Lack of imagination - raising up the tower
where they hold our souls
to take away the tower.

[Lugaid]
Use your mind!
You will leave the flesh dimensions behind.
Sanity can be the toll -
leading to the core of your soul.

[Gabriel]
We are the power inside, we bring you fantasy.
We are the kingdom of light and dreams,
gnosis and life: Avantasia!
We are the power inside, we bring you fantasy.
We are the kingdom of light and dreams,
gnosis and life: Avantasia!

Oh - Avantasia
Oh - I hear the voices
Oh - into the light
Oh - Avantasia...

10. A New Dimension
[instrumental]

11. Inside
[Elderane]
We're the little creatures
deep inside your mind.

[Regrin]
Some call us their fantasy
but some to never find.

[Elderane]
We can teach philosophy
but still we must commend...

[Regrin]
The state of our existence
right into your hand
Welcome to this place in here come overstep all your fears...

[Gabriel]
Where have you all been once
when I was alone?
When I was a hero in their crazy wicked show
you've sent no little spark
into my darkened view of life.
Did not make me ask for what is wrong
and what is right.

And still I regret to be here.
I'm dreaming of Anna in tears.

Inside - so deep inside
you will die if I don't dream anymore?
Inside - so deep inside
you will die if I don't dream anymore?

12. Sign Of The Cross
[Gabriel]
From a world of reign they come...

[Pope]
In a world of mammon we have found it all!
Fighting for pride and for gold.
But the key to the reign, to the ultimate control:
wisdom of the old.

We have been elect to drain the wine
of Gnosis to hide it and pray.
Got to save our children from the beast.
We are on the way.

[Elderane]
Remaining in darkness
the land of salvation will drown.
And when we'll have vanished
slavery will take your freedom down.

[Gabriel]
Seven eyes to be blind forever in time:
Sign of the cross...
Hell arise! Castigation under the sign,
sign of the cross - make us drown in altar wine.

[Bishop von Bicken]
In the heart of justice called Horeb long ago
Moses got carvings in stone.
Imposed to judge those who do not fear
the only, the holy, the lord.

[Gabriel]
The blood of anger and pain:
Ink of the Old Testament.
I know they'll end their crusade,
drown in the blood of the lamb.

[Elderane]
Remaining in darkness
the land of salvation will drown.
And when we'll have vanished
slavery will take your freedom down.

[Gabriel]
Seven eyes to be blind forever in time:
Sign of the cross...
Hell arise! Castigation under the sign,
sign of the cross - make us drown in altar wine.

[Regrin]
You have been the chosen one,
so welcome to this place.
Vandroiy's told us you would come
to help us win the race.
Bring back the seal from the men
who don't know what they do.
Seemed to be a fool without and own way of life.
But you've been a sleeping mind
and you woke up on time.
You've got the power to save us and finally you.

[Gabriel]
A dream is forever.
The land of salvation can't drown.
These enchanting colors -
who could have the might to tear it down?
(all these colors - fantasy...)

Seven eyes to be blind forever in time:
Sign of the cross...
Hell arise! Castigation under the sign,
sign of the cross - make us drown in altar wine.

13. The Tower
[Gabriel]
Where do I go?

Never had a very real dream before.
Now I got a vision of an open door.
Guiding me home, where I belong,
dreamland I have come.

Oh where do I go?

Never had a flesh and blood like this before.
Got a new appearance when I passed the door.
Is it a dream I am withing? Oh what's going on?

Down, down, down
Go down, go down, go down
I roam into nowhere.
Don't see an end: eternal wastelands.
And I hear the voice, the voice, the voice, the voice...

Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah...

Never been a fighter, never been a man.
But I must help Vandroiy, he's my only friend.
Nowhere to go and I know that he knows how
we will get her out...

Magic of transcendence
brought me to this place
A Vandroiy in reality lead me on my race.
Told me to bring back the seal
but still I don't know where I shall go.

[Lugaid]
Can't you 'feel' the voice?
You don't have a choice.
What a kind of life:
Freedom in flesh - shackles on your mind...

Go all the way to the tower!
Find out the secrets behind!
Go all the way to the tower!
For all the wisdom of ages doesn't die.

[Elderane]
Men have good intentions
on their way to the light.
But some of them are venal
and end up in the night.
Maybe it's better for you, mankind,
not to know what's going on.

[Gabriel]
Sometimes we must go
ways that seem to be wrong.
What a kind of life: Freedom in flesh,
shackles on your mind...

[Lugaid]
Go all the way to the tower!
Find out the secrets behind!
Go all the way to the tower!
Find out the name of the one
who reigns from inside...

[Voice in the Tower]
You have come the long way through ages
to bring me the seven parts of the seal.
So now throw it over the walls of the tower.
Throw the seal!

[Pope]
But first Godfather, what about the prophecy? What
about your reward: The ultimate illumination, the
gnosis and the power to defend your kingdom on
earth with a strong hand? What about the prophecy?

[Lugaid]
I realize...

[all]
For the glory, for the glory, for the glory,
For the glory. Oh - what is going on?
For the glory, for the glory, for the glory,
For the glory. Oh - what is going on?

[Lugaid]
Gabriel I can feel:
You have it back - book and seal.
Still no war is won, we have just begun...

Go all the way to the tower!
Long for the secrets behind!
Go all the way to the tower!
Found out the name of the one
who reigns from inside...

Go all the way to the tower!
Long for the secrets behind!
Go all the way to the tower!
Found out the name of the one,
Of the one...

[Jakob]
Oh, how could the stranger steal the seal away?
Was it my fault? Or was it no one's fault at all?

1. The Seven Angels
[Believers:]

Fire falling from the sky
Rage of god is coming down
Armaggeddon's drawing nigh
Sinner cry ! Heathen die !
Hear the toll of pain, gloria, gloria
In the fiery rain
Fire falling from the sky
Rage of god is coming down
Armaggeddon's drawing nigh
Sinner cry ! Heathen die !
Hear the toll of pain, gloria, gloria

Now the time has come, the end's begun
And the only one will come

[Gabriel:]

It has been foretold
By the visions of the old
And the madness in their eyes
Said his angel will arise
That's what they know : "Holy Lord it's over, oh god
We have done no wrong
So we go where we belong
To the neverending dream
But for those who lived in sin"
They claim to know : "Holy Lord it's over, oh god"

[Pope:]

Hey Angel, can you tell me
Will you lead us to the place
Full of heat, in the fire
For we only brought disgrace

[Lugaid:]

He is not the one. If they only knew

[Bishop:]

Hey Angel, will you take us
To the judgement of his rage
Hey will we die
For we couldn't close the gate

[Lugaid:]

To the knowledge as they have been told

[Gabriel:]

I don't know how could I prove
Nothing but the cloven hoof
Reigning over them as well
While they keep on fighting hell
Babylon the scarlet whore has come

We are the seven, judgement of heaven
Why don't we know : We are the angels
It's revelation, soul castignation
Fire will burn us away
We are the seven, judgement of heaven
Why don't we know : We are the angels
It's revelation, soul castignation
Fire will burn us away

[Pope:]

Redeemer, devastion
Hope it only has been ment 
For the sin of the dreamer
who broke the low you'd sent

[Lugaid:]

He is not the one. If they only knew

[Jakob:]

Hey, don't know but i wondered:
When we lost the seal again
Maybe stoned by the incense
Do we rise or just descent

[Lugaid:]

He is not the one. If they only knew

[Gabriel:]

I don't know how could I prove
Nothing but the cloven hoof
Reigning over them as well
While they keep on fighting hell
Babylon the scarlet whore has come

We are the seven, judgement of heaven
Why don't we know : We are the angels
It's revelation, soul castignation
Fire will burn us away
We are the seven, judgement of heaven
Why don't we know : We are the angels
It's revelation, soul castignation
Fire will burn us away

[Solo: Henjo Richter]

[Voice of the tower:]

Woe to you longing for the wisdom
Woe to you longing for the light
All my sons bring me back what is mine
Or you'll end burning in this night
Woe to you longing for the wisdom
Woe to you longing for the light
All my sons bring me back what is mine
Or you'll end burning in this night

[Solo: Timo Tolkki]

[Gabriel:]

Once I have been lost in what they told me to believe
Until I felt in burning deep inside to set my spirit free
And I escaped to another world to help the little men
who make me plunge into philosophy - to feel my
mind again... No one left to hold me tight - on the
`real`other side - but her in chains

I had been alone till the madman come along
With the knowledge and silver long beard
He was the first man ever teaching how I could be free
Helping me to find - oh - the mind and the soul
They've been trying to hide away...
And he promised we'd help Anna if I'd help him to
go all the way

[Lugaid:]

Go all the way into the world of minds
Open the gate and do not close behind
Prevent them from hiding the light away
Prevent them from tellin' us tales
Or the end of all they scare us with will be a
million empty brains...

[Gabriel:]

I could bring you what you told me
The seal they need to close the gate forever
But still I haven't found a meaning
Anna will we ever be together

[Regrin:]

You've been fighting for your soul
And sometimes it takes a toll
Hope one day you'll understand
What it means to hold in hands
What they call a fantasy
It is nothing but a key
To the world that now you're in
That they call a wicked dream

[Elderane:]

When you're walking on your own
When you're broken and alone
You may feel us from inside - 
on the other side of life.
Ohohohoh...

[Gabriel:]

I've been fighting for my soul
And sometimes it takes a toll
Hope one day we'll understand
What it means to hold in hands
What we call a fantasy
But it's nothing but a key
To the world that now I'm in
That we call a wicked dream

Oh, walking on my own
When I'm broken and alone
I may feel you from inside
From the other side of life

2. No Return
[Lugaid:]

Mental vigour's been right on the egde
To a 'stupefying' hole of no return
Now we dance a holy war is won
But there must be more we got to learn

[Gabriel:]

Don't you know that I'm here I must go
Into the morning light - illuminate the night
Be the guide on our side - the Gnosis

No return - I will go, follow the call of my spirit
No return - I must know all that I never could ask
No return

No I still can't leave the world in here
Soon I feel that I am gonna get her free
But I've smelled at and I long for more
Take me in, oh i beg, philosophy

Oh I got to know, more now so I must go on
Into the morning light - illuminate the night
Be the guide on our side - the Gnosis

No return - I will go, follow the call of my spirit
No return - I must know all that I never could ask
No return

Solo: Henjo Richter

[Eldrane:]

No return - maybe you must pay
Many've been in quest for truth
Insanity has swallowed away
No return - but I wish you all the best
Go and face the tree of knowledge and be free

[Gabriel:]

No return - I will go, follow the call of my spirit
No return - I must know all that I never could ask

3. The Looking Glass
[Gabriel:]

Drawn by the sound of that wild raving pound
No one has told me
I gotta know all about hell and below
They never told me

The quest for nexus
In your life and for all that's beyond...

[Gabriel:]

When I gaze at the man who is gazing at me
When I stare into the looking glass
When I ask what he sees
Then I'm asking for more and the more
that i wanna know
I know what I'll never know

[Tree of Knowledge:]

From far away, from the state of decay
You've come to wisdom
Many've been led, into madness instead
Toll of my kingdom
The quest for nexus has brought
Many men of genius to insanity

[Gabriel:]

When I gaze at the man who is gazing at me
When I stare into the looking glass
When I ask what he sees

[Tree of Knowledge:]

Then you're asking for more, and the more that
you wanna know
You know what you'll never know

[Solo: Henjo Richter]

[Tree of Knowledge:]

As long as you long for the whole
You can't get a part of at all
How proud would the buildings of Rome
Look without a single stone

[Gabriel:]

When I gaze at the man who is gazing at me
When I stare into the looking glass
When I ask what he sees
Then I'm asking for more and the more
that i wanna know
I know what I'll never know...

4. In Quest For
[Tree of Knowledge:]

Coming from the wastelands
Full of reason, common sense
Where their principles are blocking minds
And you don't understand
Giving you belief,
You never touch, you never see
But if you dare to try to grip it
you're accused for heresy

[Gabriel:]

Here I stand to find the truth
and for ought I know
You're the one to show me
You can tell my spirit how to grow

No, the more I try
The more confusion on my mind
And no matter how I try
I feel my eyes seem to stay blind

[Tree of Knowledge:]

No use in analysing, forget about alchemy
Because the secret of all truth
Is the quest for - and you'll feel

When you knock right on the door
"Forever locked" they say
A little man will let you in,
For you have always tried - to get inside

You're in quest for more to find the core
Your journey still ain't over
Your quest is your purpose, go on
You're in quest for more to find the core
It will be - never- over
Your quest is your purpose, go on ...

You're in quest for more to find the core...

5. The Final Sacrifice
[Gabriel:]

Staring into the lake, watching for heaven's sake
faces screaming in fear
Crying like at the stake, in the fiery waves
I can see all the souls how they suffer and howl
in their eternal pain
Service taking its toll, living life in hades

All the souls that left their mortal
frame if it's been dead or not
All the deaf who did not hear the truth

Get ready for the brimstone-
getting blisters on the eyes
The power of the spirit was their final sacrifice
Get ready for the brimstone-
getting blisters on the eyes
The power of the spirit was their final sacrifice

[Jakob's voice:]

Someone pullin' me out to come back to my flesh
Or I'm going insane !
In a world under Rome, in the fiery waves
Can't you see all the souls, how we suffer and howl
In our eternal pain
Service taking the toll, living life in hades...

Oh I see you standing on the
shore of castigation now
We don't wanna burn no more so pull us out,out,out

Get ready for the brimstone-
getting blisters on the eyes
The power of the spirit was our final sacrifice
Get ready for the brimstone-
getting blisters on the eyes
The power of the spirit was our final sacrifice

Get ready !

[Solo: Jens Ludwig]

Get ready for the brimstone...

6. Neverland
[Bishop:]

Cought in neverland, no purpose to be seen
There's no point of destination
Neverending wastelands, such a wicked odyssey
Don't know what we have done wrong
Lead us back to Rome to follow you again
Bring you the power, get salvation
I know less than all but more
than many who know less
I know it's keeping us strong

[Gabriel:]

And while they are pulling strings
While they are in command
They're hanging on strings
And fate they do commend into another hand

Cought in neverland, heat and fire, snow and ice
They call nether world what we call a paradise
Cought in neverland and their spirits cannot rise
From the nether world, they can't see a paradise

And the Roman whore, the masters and the slaves
Raging on without they don't know
Good intentions on their minds
Can't ask for why they bow out

[Bishop:]

Lead us to Eden, judge those who bite off more
than they can chew to serve, without they ask
Or call in doubt the ask

[Gabriel:]

Cought in neverland, heat and fire, snow and ice
They call nether world what we call a paradise
Cought in neverland and their spirits cannot rise
From the nether world, they can't see a paradise

[Solo: Henjo Richter]

Cought in neverland in the place of many eyes
Make it be what they are allowed to realize

Cought in neverland, heat and fire, snow and ice...

7. Anywhere
[Gabriel:]

I remember it was long ago
But when I think of her I fell it grow
Something begs me to come home again
Something I can hardly stand

But I'm to defy, I have to ignore her cry
I don't know what to do, I'm missing you so bad

Waiting for tomorrow, for a little ray of light
Waiting for tomorrow just to see your smile again
Take away my sorrow from a blistered heart of mine
Where are you now if you are there anywhere

Please forgive me for how I decide
But before I can come with rapid strides
Don't expect you'll have to understand
Jakob needs my helping hand

First I have to go one out of two ways
Wich both are wrong and I'm to go
So afraid, so ashamed
So deranged - but I know...

Waiting for tomorrow, for a little ray of light
Waiting for tomorrow just to see your smile again
Take away my sorrow from a blistered heart of mine
Where are you now if you are there anywhere

[Solo: Henjo Richter]

Waiting for tomorrow, for a little ray of light...
I can't wait for you - Are you there - anywhere

8. Chalice Of Agony
[Gabriel:]

Ah - Hugh !
Show me the way to he hallways
below Rome, I will be there
I've seen them burning in fire
They all bear too much to bear

[Elderane:]

Why don't you think of all those who will come
Don't you waste your life

[Gabriel:]

Don't you try show me the way
Don't need 'good advice'

[Elderane:]

Cold hallways so old, a chalice of gold
A guard as they say, paralyzed
Follow the cries from out of the blood
The wine in the cup

[Gabriel:]

Out of the wine, out of the chalice of agony
Welcome to Avantasia
Out of the wine, out of the chalice of agony
Welcome to Avantasia

[Gabriel:]

Regrin my friend we are passing the gate
Back into my world

[Regrin:]

I am afraid of the guard and I wish
Warnings had been heard

[Gabriel:]

Welcome to Rome, it's our mission
to make tortured spirits free

[Regrin:]

Something's in here, oh I wish I could hide
from its staring eyes

[Gabriel:]

Cold hallways so old, a chalice of gold
And I feel a chill
Staring eyes, while I hear the cries
From out of the blood, the wine in the cup

Out of the wine, out of the chalice of agony
Welcome to Avantasia
Out of the wine, out of the chalice of agony
Welcome to Avantasia

[Solo: Henjo Richter]

No way out, we got to run to the gate
No way out , for some of the souls it's too late
Jakob are you free

Out of the wine, out of the chalice of agony
Welcome to Avantasia
Out of the wine, out of the chalice of agony
Welcome to Avantasia

9. Memory
[Falk:]

Oh, I dare not to sleep anymore
Cause I see her face in every nightmare
In all the windows of my haunted house
And when I dream a dream of flowers
I wake up in my hand a bloody rose

'Blood shall come upon you'
So she spoke to me
Never knew she'd come back
Now she's on my dreams
From the faces in my dream
From an evil memory
As foretold in their prediction
From the faces in my dream
They are coming back for me
As it was told in their prediction
Is it just a dream
Or just a wicked memory ... Oh

Now I see her coming on her besom...
The smell of brimstone
And the mark of the beast
From the open window
Is it just a dream
As she's pulling out the dagger to stab
A thousand times into my hurting breast

Wake up from the nightmare
Screaming when I see her stand
with the face of Jakob
A bloody dagger in her hand

From the faces in my dream
From an evil memory
As foretold in their prediction
From the faces in my dream
They are coming back for me
As it was told in their prediction
Is it just a dream

[Gabriel:]

Maybe his conscience
Will send him a dream in his dreams
If I only knew - oh Anna -
If his soul also came free
Or maybe if Jakob
Would talk to the bailiff for you
I can't come for you

I don't know how many souls were set free
To start a rebellion, don't know if I'll still have to flee

[Solo: Jens Ludwig]

Oh that faces in my dream...
From the faces in my dream
From an evil memory...

10. Into The Unknown
[Anna:]

Heading for another life
In a new world far away
Why not me, oh Lord
Why did Vandroiy have to die, why

[Gabriel:]

Dreamers come and go
But a dream's forever
Freedom for all minds
Let us go together
Neverending ways
Got to roam forever
Always carry on

Walking down a misty road into the unknown
Heavy winds may blow into our faces
You can't kill the dream in killing the dreamer
Can't tear it down
Always carry on

Dreamers come and go
But a dream's forever
Freedom for all minds
Let us go together
Neverending ways
Got to roam forever
Always carry on

I've seen dreamers come and go

1. Twisted Mind
[Vocals by Tobias Sammet and Roy Khan]

[Psychiatrist (Roy Khan):]
One of a kind they say they've never seen before
Investigate the aberration, disorder in the core

[Scarecrow (Tobias Sammet):]
I never tried to hide away or tried to keep your pace
You walk me to the slaughter with a smile upon your face

[Chorus (Scarecrow):]
From the cradle to the madhouse, a twisted mind
There's no way out of this hell for twisted mind
There's no way out
There's no way out

[Psychiatrist (Roy Khan):]
You've come to see the healer, so don't you be afraid
They call me tranquilizer, I'm here to isolate
We paint in black and white and you're the dirty in between
Monstrosity of nature, a virulent disease

[Chorus]

[Psychiatrist (Roy Khan):]
Can't you see, can't you see
That you are not like anyone?
You'll never see through anyone else's eyes
And who am I to certify the sanity of a twisted mind
A victim of perception, a twisted mind

[x2]
Missprizing — chastising
Subhuman — fragmentizing
Sensation — aberration
Repulsive — tantalizing

[Scarecrow (Tobias Sammet) 2x:]
From the cradle to the madhouse, a twisted mind
There's no way out of this hell for twisted mind

There's no way out [x6]

2. The Scarecrow
[vocals by Tobias Sammet, Jorn Lande and Michael Kiske]

[Scarecrow (Tobias Sammet):]
I'm just a loser in the game of love
I'm just a stray boy in the shade
And how I wish to know what love is like
To find someone to contemplate

There's a voice and a million answers
To the questions I don't ask
A demon — I've got to contain
When I'm walking through the fen
Getting deep into the black
Whispers I can't restrain

Don't give in

[Chorus:]
Rise to fame — time will come
Make your claim — time has come
For the crow who fly away

[Mephistopheles (Jorn Lande):]
So you're an angel meant to walk down here
And you believe it's all divine
And you don't play by all those temporal rules
You watch the world begin to die

Alright — when the lamb's been torn to pieces
I've been crashing from the sky
Fallen to care for the prey,
they put a spoke right in your wheel
I'm the one to dare the weak,
to push you all over the pain
You give in — oh

[Chorus]

[Solo: Sascha Paeth]

[Scarecrow (Tobias Sammet):]
I close my eyes and I see what's coming my way
He's got treasure in his eyes that he's gonna turn to clay

[Mephistopheles (Jorn Lande):]
Hm, I'm a stranger,
I'm a changer
And I'm danger...
Maybe

[Scarecrow (Tobias Sammet):]
Fallen angel - waiting for the prey
The devil has come to take a maimed away
Penetration of the twisted mind
The evil is out for the weak and blind

I can feel it in your voice
Ever so sweet, no
Do I really have a choice? No, no, no!

[Mephistopheles (Jorn Lande):]
Oh, you burn your feet on unholy ground
You roam the barren wicked plains abound
In evil eyes and evil speak
Abound in all you evil freaks

When you say it's all divine and meant to be
What about your flesh and blood and defiers like me?

Their evil eyes are looking down on you
And those who don't are losing sight of you
Face the rage to chase away
The specter of disgrace and shame

Withered roses dying on the ledge
A withered dreamer standing on the edge
You dream of love—wake up to pain
You're better off to join in my game

She'll be better off to cry contrite tears
One day she'll wonder why she had to let you disappear
Oh dear

[Both]
Rise to fame — your time has come
Time will come to take the sun
Make your claim - you're drawn to the sound
Time has come — you're leaving ground

Rise to fame - the flight of the crow
Time will come - cross the line
Your time has come - for the crow to fly away

[Mephistopheles]
It's a flight to hell
Can you hear the bell?
The devil has come
To take your soul away
It's a flight to hell
alright

I'm a stranger
I'm a changer
And I'm danger
Fallen angel
Waiting for the prey

3. Shelter From The Rain
[Vocals by Tobias Sammet, Michael Kiske and Bob Catley]

[Scarecrow (Tobias Sammet):]
Like a wheel I keep on turning
Straight ahead, it's got me burning
The melody — the dignity,
Something is speaking to me
Night is cold and my soul is battered
Not afraid for the first time now that I realize
We coincide, I'll never belong to the tribe
And a song is calling me to this ship of fools

[Chorus:]
Been dying for a sign when faith has been on the line
When you find your love on wasted grounds
You're taking to the sound,
It's shelter from the rain

[Mentor (Michael Kiske):]
No return from the way I've chosen,
Cast away - chasing rainbows - condemn the lie
And how could I make god believe I am blind?
We create by intuition,
Call it fate — the tongue of angels in our soul
Feel it resound and carry you over the grind
All that's left is a song giving shelter from the rain

[Chorus:]
Been dying for a sign when faith has been on the line
When I find my love on wasted grounds
I'm taking to the sound
It's shelter from the rain

[Conscience (Bob Catley):]
It's a dark and stormy night.
Ain't it funny what it takes to read the signs?
But I am always there,
I am the footprints to your right
Man overlooks when riding high, young and blind
In your darkest lonely night,
Heed a voice to take you higher
Take you higher
As you stumble through the ruins, let the spirit take you higher, and a soul

[Scarecrow (Tobias Sammet):]
Oh, and a song
I can hear a song

[Chorus:]
Been dying for a sign when faith has been on the line
When you find your love on wasted grounds
You're taking to the sound
It's shelter from the rain
Been dying for a sign when faith has been on the line
When I find my love on wasted grounds
I'm taking to the sound
It's shelter from the rain

4. Carry Me Over
[vocals by Tobias Sammet]

[Scarecrow (Tobias Sammet):]
Never been told my prayers would be answered
Wherever I go I see you around
Never been told that something that beautiful
Would bring me up to let me down

Waiting up on the roof,
Waiting up in the rain
Just to catch a glimpse of your face
Even when you're around
Still I'm out of sight, out of sound
In your world I'm out of place

[Chorus:]
Carry me over, carry me over
Carry me over now
Carry me over, carry me over
Carry me over now

You're like a ghost that I can't let go
You follow every step that I take
Never thought someone could be too close to you
Now across the street is miles away

And now I might as well be the man in the moon
I am watching but you don't seem aware
But I won't be around
I'll be out of sight, out of sound
Someone's gonna wait somewhere

[Chorus 3x]

5. What Kind Of Love
[Vocals by Amanda Somerville, Tobias Sammet and Michael Kiske]

[Amanda Somerville:]
A dream of a dwelling inside
Alone we come and alone we go
And who am I to know what I feel:
Sympathy that's tearing me apart?
Attraction of the distance to a heart or affinity?

What if love will leave your heart an open sore
And I can't reveal what even I don't know?
The love you feel you waste away on me
What kind of love will let us bleed away?
No kind of love will make us bleed away

[Scarecrow (Tobias Sammet):]
If only you could be
The one to take a look inside
I feel so incomplete
A broken man in need of mother love
I'm suffering in silence and no one wants to see
The only god is watching as I bleed
The star above—my matching piece

[Amanda Somerville:]
Oh, this love will leave your heart an open sore
And I can't reveal what even I don't know
This love you feel you waste away on me
What kind of love will let us bleed away?
No kind of love will make us bleed away

[Scarecrow (Tobias Sammet):]
Feel—that's all you gotta do
And it will heal you
Feel the pain to lead you home to peace of mind
Dwell inside
Feel—that's all you gotta do
And it will heal the wound
Feel—there will be a song for peace of mind
Dwell inside

6. Another Angel Down
[Vocals by Tobias Sammet and Jorn Lande]

[Mephistopheles (Jorn Lande):]
I am the master of the game that's made a fool of you
I'm watching from the highest tower
You've got the aura to enchant them and a symphony
And I've got the power

You better taste: they call it life — my special area
I'm breeding winners over there
Ain't it a sin to turn your back on what you're given?
It's time to take your share

[Scarecrow (Tobias Sammet):]
God left me for dead - I've been turning my head
Away from the living - the time has come
To gamble for gain - to tear down the gate
And see what's inside

[Chorus:]
We rock the ball, been smashed to the ground
Arose from devotion to take a look and see what is inside
Sight of the crown: another angel down
We rock the ball, I'm facing my pain
A rage and a symphony driven by the wounds I cannot hide
Rise above the crowd: another angel down

[Scarecrow (Tobias Sammet):]
We'll see a black hole will be left up in the starry sky
We gotta mourn another angel
If I am just a light descending to caducity
It's still so far away

There's no tomorrow, I don't remember yesterday
I'm just living for tonight
And all the love I'm not gonna waste no more
I won't spit what's divine

[Mephistopheles (Jorn Lande):]
They left you for dead - turning your head
Away from the living - from flesh and blood
You've got the draw and desire to claw
For fortune and fame

[Chorus]

7. The Toy Master
[Vocals by Alice Cooper and Tobias Sammet]

[Dealer (Alice Cooper):]
Don't you be afraid, come and step inside, take a look around
I'm your holy grail in your candy store to save you from the profound
They used to dream in only black and white
Can't you hear them scream, drowning in the tide?

[Pre-chorus:]
Out in the cold I see water frozen in their eyes
What a sorry sight
I am willing to believe they would pay for a smile

[Chorus:]
I'm the master of toys
And all you girls and boys
Are welcome to my wonderland.
I'm the angel of joy
And I'm here to paint the void.
Welcome to my world,

To my dream factory.

Say hello to the gentleman with the paint
The deeper you're in the blue, the sweeter the sound of your plaint
If only I had a heart it would break — oh sure
And I wonder how much more they can take

[Pre-chorus sung by Scarecrow (Tobias Sammet)]
[Chorus]

I'm dealing in pain
And a little Novocaine
Welcome to my world, to my toy factory

[2x]
No more struggle of the classes
No more struggle of the masses
On their knees, conformity
They are ready for a hero
They are flying at zero
It's their turn to crash and burn

[Chorus]

I come to bring you pain
And a little Novocaine
Welcome to my world.

8. Devil In The Belfry
[Vocals by Tobias Sammet and Jorn Lande]

[Scarecrow (Tobias Sammet):]
I dropped off in the shadows
The lead of a tragedy
I open my eyes — blind by the spotlight
And what do I see?

[Mephistopheles (Jorn Lande):]
Pushed by ambition,
Been granted admission
To the hall of acclaim,
She denied your affection,
Now listen, the whole world is screaming your name

[Scarecrow (Tobias Sammet):]
I will forget her but I won't forgive
The curtain has fallen, behold the messiah

[Chorus:]
Riding high,
The devil on the crest for all the world to see forevermore
I am I —
Devil in the belfry, I'll be glorified forevermore

[Mephistopheles (Jorn Lande):]
Is it a sin to learn to be able to live without love?
And is it a sin to put love under will and control from above?

[Scarecrow (Tobias Sammet):]
Devil in my fingers, pleasure at my feet
Mind out of sight
The shadow I'll cast shall darken her world
And ghost her at night

With each song you'll die a little for me
It won't leave a scar, 'cause I've drawn the curtain

[Chorus 2x]

[Mephistopheles (Jorn Lande):]
Into the opera like moths to the flame
Spellbind their senses to follow the hero

[Chorus 2x]

9. Cry Just A Little
[Vocals by Tobias Sammet and Bob Catley]

[Scarecrow (Tobias Sammet):]
A heart out of affection, night at the masquerade
You won some and you're lonesome as the spotlight fades
Going forth pretending destination is at hand
When she's crying just a little just for me

[Conscience (Bob Catley):]
I've seen them set off to the Promised Land
Escaping from the hurtings they don't understand
A sense of satisfaction on account of pristine tears
She's crying just a little more just like you

No, oh, no, no

[Chorus (Scarecrow):]
Why don't you cry, cry a little over me?
Why don't you lie?
Can't you tell me that I am hard to deny?
Can't you see what I am going through?
Cry just a little for me,
Oh, girl, a little for me

[Conscience (Bob Catley):]
Afraid to give away what you keep inside
There's a ghost in your mirror every lonesome night
All those nights are getting colder and your heart's a frozen wound
Don't you wonder who'll be there when you awake?

No, oh

[Chorus 2x]

10. I Don't Believe In Your Love
[Vocals by Tobias Sammet and Oliver Hartmann]

[Darkness (Oliver Hartmann):]
No one around to hear your cries
No one there to even realize you grit your teeth
What are you afraid to lose when you're left alone?
I'm the one to make you anything you wanna be

[Scarecrow (Tobias Sammet):]
Never broke the silence, never broke the ice
No more waiting, I gotta wipe her off my mind
Loving her is dying, loving her is pain
Babylon I'm coming, ready for the fray

I don't believe in your love, tread on this bed of roses
I don't believe in your love, don't give a fuck for roses

Don't give damn for roses, no, no, no

[Darkness (Oliver Hartmann):]
You've been standing on the edge,
Lost between the worlds of agony and ecstasy
Take your share boy straightaway, it's all heaven sent
She won't care: they call their love divine but it's all evil

[Scarecrow (Tobias Sammet):]
Loving you was bleeding so I had to break away
Darkness' stretching out its hand to save me from your sway
'Cause loving you was wasting, loving you was pain
Now angel of temptation, open up the gate

I don't believe in your love
Tread on this bed of roses
I don't believe in your love

Don't give a fuck for roses

[Scarecrow (Tobias Sammet):]
Loving you was bleeding, so I had to break away
Darkness' stretching out it's hand, to save me from your swear
'Cause loving you was wasting, loving you was pain
Now angel of temptation, open up the gate
'Cause loving you was wasting,

[2x]
I don't believe in your love, tread on this bed of roses
I don't believe in your love, don't give a fuck for roses

No I don't believe, I don't believe in your love
Your love, no, no, no, no
No I don't believe in your love

11. Lost In Space
[Vocals by Tobias Sammet and Amanda Somerville]

[Scarecrow (Tobias Sammet):]
Another star has fallen without sound
Another spark has burned out in the cold
Another door to the barren standing open
And who is there to tell not to give in, not to go?

[Chorus:]
How could I know, how could I know?
That I'll get lost in space to roam forever
How could I know, how could I see?
Feeling like lost in space to roam forever

I'm crawling down the doorway to the badlands
Been kicking down all your hurdles to the black
And all the damage fading in the rearview mirror
And the demons are calling me, they're dragging me away

[Chorus]

[Amanda Somerville:]
Lost in space, lost in time
Lost in space, lost in time
Lost in space

[Scarecrow (Tobias Sammet):]
How could I know, how could I?
How could I know, how could I know
That I'll get lost in space to roam forever?
How could I know, how could I see?
Feeling like lost in space to roam forever

Forever...

1. Avantasia (Edit)
Open my eyes and see my bleeding wounded hands
Feeling the pain too hard to stand.
To stand caught in the 'now and here'
while they are on the way
Hiding imagination, leading us astray

Use your mind!
You will leave the flesh dimensions behind
Sanity can be the toll
leading to the core of your soul

We are the power inside, we bring you fantasy
We are the kingdom of light and dreams, gnosis and life: Avantasia!
We are the power inside, we bring you fantasy
We are the kingdom of light and dreams, gnosis and life: Avantasia! Avantasia...

Walking along the icy gallery of pain
Tell me now: what can keep the flame alive?
Lack of imagination raising up the tower
where they hold our souls to take away the tower

Use your mind!
You will leave the flesh dimensions behind
Sanity can be the toll
leading to the core of your soul

We are the power inside, we bring you fantasy
We are the kingdom of light and dreams, gnosis and life: Avantasia!
We are the power inside, we bring you fantasy
We are the kingdom of light and dreams, gnosis and life: Avantasia!

2. Reach Out For The Light
Lord above - why don't you tell me
why I'm here in agony?
I've been serving, I've been praying
now I'm caught in misery

I've been praised by friar Jakob,
I misused his confidence
Cheated by this work of evil
feigning Anna's innocence

Oh what have I done?
So many ways lead to the fallen one,
Lucifer, fallen light...
Oh what have I done?
What is going on?

We should bring salvation,
not give in to his temptation  no!
Read and preach the holy world
and no forbidden lies that hurt
I remember words of "seven"
Set me free - sanity!

Reach out for the light
far beyond confines
You have read the magic lines
leading to the light in your mind...

What is right and what is wrong now?
Is it a trial of paradise?

Is Anna a witch or do they stick to an error?
What's the book and the seal inside?

Am I a cleric or maybe a sinner?
Unbeliever? Renegade?
Was it the devil who led me to "seven"?
Oh redeemer is it all too late?

Oh, what have I done?
I have been led by the smelling one,
Lucifer, fallen light...
Tell me stranger, what have I done?
Oh what's going on?

We should bring salvation,
not give in to his temptation  no!
Read and preach the holy world
and no forbidden lies that hurt
I remember words of "seven"
Set me free - sanity!

Reach out for the light
far beyond confines
You have read the magic lines
leading to the light in your mind...

In your mind?

3. The Final Sacrifice
Staring into the lake,
watching for heaven's sake faces screaming in fear
Crying like at the stake, in the fiery waves
I can see all the souls how they suffer and howl
in their eternal pain
Service taking its toll, living life in hades

All the souls that left their mortal
frame if it's been dead or not
All the deaf who did not hear the truth

Get ready for the brimstone
getting blisters on the eyes
The power of the spirit was their final sacrifice
Get ready for the brimstone
getting blisters on the eyes
The power of the spirit was their final sacrifice

Someone pullin' me out to come back to my flesh
Or I'm going insane!
In a world under Rome, in the fiery waves
Can't you see all the souls, how we suffer and howl
In our eternal pain
Service taking the toll, living life in hades

Oh I see you standing on the
shore of castigation now
We don't wanna burn no more so pull us out, out, out

Get ready for the brimstone
getting blisters on the eyes
The power of the spirit was our final sacrifice
Get ready for the brimstone
getting blisters on the eyes
The power of the spirit was our final sacrifice

Get ready !

Get ready for the brimstone
getting blisters on the eyes
The power of the spirit was our final sacrifice
Get ready for the brimstone
getting blisters on the eyes
The power of the spirit was our final sacrifice

4. Avantasia
Open my eyes and see my bleeding wounded hands
Feeling the pain too hard to stand.
To stand caught in the 'now and here'
while they are on the way
Hiding imagination, leading us astray

Use your mind!
You will leave the flesh dimensions behind
Sanity can be the toll
leading to the core of your soul

We are the power inside, we bring you fantasy
We are the kingdom of light and dreams, gnosis and life: Avantasia!
We are the power inside, we bring you fantasy
We are the kingdom of light and dreams, gnosis and life: Avantasia! Avantasia...

Walking along the icy gallery of pain
Tell me now: What can keep the flame alive?
Lack of imagination raising up the tower
where they hold our souls
to take away the tower

Use your mind!
You will leave the flesh dimensions behind
Sanity can be the toll
leading to the core of your soul

We are the power inside, we bring you fantasy
We are the kingdom of light and dreams, gnosis and life: Avantasia!
We are the power inside, we bring you fantasy
We are the kingdom of light and dreams, gnosis and life: Avantasia!

1. Lost In Space
Another star
has fallen without a sound
Another spark
has burned out in the cold

Another door
to barrens standing open

And who is there
to tell me not to give and not to go

How could I know? how could I know?
That I'll get lost in space to roam forever

How could I know? how could I see?
feeling like lost in space to roam forever

I'm crawling down
The doorway to the badlands
And kicking down

Are you heard: it's to the black
and all the damage
fading in the oblivion mirror
When the demons
are calling me, their dragging me away

How could I know?, how could I know?
That I'll get lost in space to roam forever

How could I know?, how could I see?
feeling like lost in space to roam forever

Lost in space
lost in time
Lost in space
Lost in Time
Lost in Space

How could I know, how could i know
How could I know, How could I know
That I'll get lost in space to roam for ever

How could I now, how could I see
feeling like lost in space to roam forever

Forever...

2. Lay All Your Love On Me
[ABBA Cover]

I wasn't jealous before we met
Now every man I see is a potential threat
And I'm possessive, it isn't nice
You've heard me saying that smoking was my only vice
But now it isn't true
Now everything is new
And all I've learned has overturned
I beg of you
Don't go wasting your emotion
Lay all your love on me

It was like shooting a sitting duck
A little small talk, a smile and baby I was stuck
I still don't know what you've done with me
A grown-up man should never fall so easily
I feel a kind of fear
When I don't have you near
Unsatisfied, I skip my pride
I beg you dear

Don't go wasting your emotion
Lay all your love on me
Don't go sharing your devotion
Lay all your love on me

I've had a few little love affairs
They didn't last very long and they've been pretty scarce
I used to think it was sensible
It makes the truth even more incomprehensible
'Cause everything is new
And everything is you
And all I've learned has overturned
What can I do

Don't go wasting your emotion
Lay all your love on me
Don't go sharing your devotion
Lay all your love on me

3. Another Angel Down
[feat. Jorn Lande]

I am the master of the game
that s made a fool you
I m watching from the highest tower
You got the aura to enchant them - and a symphony
And I have got the power

You better taste - they call it life: my special area
I m breeding winners over there
Ain't it a sin to turn your back
on what you re given
It s time to take your share

God left me for dead - I've been turning my head
Away from the living - the time has come
To gamble for gain - To tear down the gate
And see what's inside

We rock the ball
Been smashed to the ground
Arose from devotion
To take a look and see what is inside
Sight of the crown: Another angel down
We rock the ball
I m facing my pain
With a rage and a symphony
Driven by the wounds I cannot hide
Rise above the crowd: another angel down

We ll see a black hole will be left up in the starry sky
We gotta mourn another angel
If I am just a light descending to caducity
It s still so far away

There s no tomorrow
I don t remember yesterday
I m just living for tonight
And all the love I m not gonna waste no more
I won t spit what s divine

They left you for dead - turning your head
Away form the living - from flesh and blood
You've got the draw and desire to claw
For fortune and fame

We rock the ball
Been smashed to the ground
Arose from devotion
To take a look and see what is inside
Sight of the crown: Another angel down
We rock the ball
I m facing my pain
With a rage and a symphony
Driven by the wounds I cannot hide
Rise above the crowd: another angel down

4. The Story Ain't Over
[feat. Bob Catley & Amanda Somerville]

Rousing from dreams, craving for someone
Wept himself to sleep
He s waiting for a sign from above
Where is the love

The hourglass in pieces, dashed to the wall
The future is over
Tomorrow's been slipping away
And nothing remains

He'd known it won't last forever
She'd go ahead for a while

When you open your eyes
When you gaze at the sky
When you look to the stars
As they shut down the night
You know this story ain't over

When you open your eyes
When you gaze at the sky
When you look to the stars
As they shut down the night
You feel this story ain't over

Where is the candle in this lonesome night?
Angle why are you so wayward
Abandoning me, try my belief

When life is not words
and tongue is not answers
And we only can t see a reason
Why would it mean
that it's not meant to be

He'd known it won't last forever
She d go ahead for a while

When you open your eyes
When you gaze at the sky
When you look to the stars
As they shut down the night
You know this story ain't over

When you open your eyes
When you gaze at the sky
When you look to the stars
As they shut down the night
You feel this story ain't over

5. Return To Avantasia
[Instrumental]

6. Ride The Sky
[Lucifer's Friend cover]

[feat. Eric Singer]

Traveling this dark world, leaving light behind
seeing things I shouldn't see
new eyes I got to find
Mars Venus and stars shaking
their heads at me
No more today's - tonight I'll be riding the sky

Hey world look out I'm coming
Friends pass me by and you saw me humming
Mars Venus and stars shaking
their heads at me
No more today's - tonight I'll be riding the sky
Tonight ride the sky, tonight ride the sky

The smile on his face turn me to stone
The words that he spoke
wouldn't leave me alone
Mars Venus and stars
shaking their heads at me
No more today's tonight I'll be riding the sky
Tonight ride the sky, tonight ride the sky,

Tonight ride the sky
Tonight ride the sky...

1. Lost In Space
Another star
has fallen without a sound
Another spark
has burned out in the cold

Another door
to barrens standing open

And who is there
to tell me not to give and not to go

How could I know?, how could I know?
That I'll get lost in space to roam forever

How could I know?, how could I see?
feeling like lost in space to roam forever

I'm crawling down
The doorway to the badlands
And kicking down

Are you heard: it's to the black
and all the damage
fading in the oblivion mirror
When the demons
are calling me, their dragging me away

How could I know?, how could I know?
That I'll get lost in space to roam forever

How could I know?, how could I see?
feeling like lost in space to roam forever

Lost in space
lost in time
Lost in space
Lost in Time
Lost in Space

How could I know, how could i know
How could I know, How could I know
That I'll get lost in space to roam for ever

How could I now, how could I see
feeling like lost in space to roam forever

Forever...

2. Promised Land
Hey redeemer
Now what's become on me
taken in by promise
awakening in grief

Collecting us like puppets
you instrumentalize
A frigid trepidation
in a million puppet eyes

God gave his word just to let us down
Where is he now?

You've been facing heaven
You were lost to left alone
You re welcome to my home and
Found another heaven
It was you who took my hand
Come into the promised land

You scratched my back and I scratched yours
It s you who makes decisions
I just open up the doors

Whining in the gutter
They forget their sanctity
Welcome to my clockwork
Vanity machinery

You gave your word
You let me down
What am I now

You've been facing heaven
You were lost to left alone
You re welcome to my home and
Found another heaven
It was you who took my hand
Come into the promised land

Oh as far as the eye can see
They re bent in submission
Empty inside
An army of scarecrows like me
Thousands of brokens dreams
Thousands of tragedies
Tried to run from their destiny

Like moths to a flame
Driven by vanity
They been off to Jerusalem
Chasing a dream
Calling on me
We re just trading in needs

You've been facing heaven
You were lost to left alone
You re welcome to my home and
Found another heaven
It was you who took my hand
Come into the promised land

3. Dancing With Tears In My Eyes
[Ultravox Cover]

Dancing with tears in my eyes
Weeping for the memory of a life gone by
Dancing with tears in my eyes
Living out a memory of a love that died

It's five and I'm driving home again
It's hard to believe that it's my last time
The man on the wireless cries again
It's over, it's over

Dancing with tears in my eyes
Weeping for the memory of a life gone by
Dancing with tears in my eyes
Living out a memory of a love that died

It's late and I'm with my love alone
We drink to forget the coming storm
We love to the sound of our favourite song
Over and over

Dancing with tears in my eyes
Weeping for the memory of a life gone by
Dancing with tears in my eyes
Living out a memory of a love that died

It's time and we're in each other's arms
It's time but I don't think we really care

Dancing with tears in my eyes
Weeping for the memory of a life gone by
Dancing with tears in my eyes
Living out a memory of a love that died

Dancing with tears in my eyes
Weeping for the memory of a life gone by
Dancing with tears in my eyes

4. Scary Eyes
I spy with my little eye
Things you ll never see
Whispers burn my eardrum
It s eerie to the feel

I see them crawling up the wall
I see them staring at us all
Am I afraid of what I know

They look at you, they look at me
And as they look inquiringly
They scratch their heads
And watch the show

I can t explain, am I ashamed

Scary eyes watching every move
Fail to make out a reason
Scary eyes tracing what we do
At the tail of us fools

Extraterrestrial you follow me around
Not that I don t like you
Basically you re sound

Welcome to the Stone Age
Don t ask me to explain
Or you will crash the headlines:
Martian gone insane

You can t explain why you re insane

Scary eyes watching every move
Fail to make out a reason
Scary eyes tracing what we do
At the tail of us fools

Why are you afraid of little spider
Not a claudication
Or other complication
Why don t you just be a little wiser
You stick in a relation
Instead of fornication

I can t explain, am I ashamed

Scary eyes watching every move
Fail to make out a reason
Scary eyes tracing what we do
At the tail of us fools

5. In My Defense
[Freddy Mercury Cover]

In my defence what is there to say
All the mistakes we made must be faced today
It's not easy now knowing where to start
While the world we love tears itself apart
I'm just a singer with a song
How can I try to right the wrong
For just a singer with a melody
I'm caught in between
With a fading dream

In my defence what is there to say
We destroy the love - it's our way
We never listen enough never face the truth
Then like a passing song
Love is here and then it's gone

I'm just a singer with a song
How can I try to right the wrong
For just a singer with a melody
I'm caught in between
With a fading dream

I'm just a singer with a song
How can I try to right the wrong
I'm just a singer with a melody
I'm caught in between with a fading dream
Caught in between with a fading dream
Caught in between with a fading dream

Oh what on earth
Oh what on earth
How do I try
Do we live or die

Oh help me God
Please help me

6. Lost In Space (Epic Version)
Another star
has fallen without a sound
Another spark
has burned out in the cold

Another door
to barrens standing open

And who is there
to tell me not to give and not to go

How could I know?, how could I know?
That I'll get lost in space to roam forever

How could I know?, how could I see?
feeling like lost in space to roam forever

I'm crawling down
The doorway to the badlands
And kicking down

Are you heard: it's to the black
and all the damage
fading in the oblivion mirror
When the demons
are calling me, their dragging me away

How could I know?, how could I know?
That I'll get lost in space to roam forever

How could I know?, how could I see?
feeling like lost in space to roam forever

Lost in space
Lost in time
Lost in space
Lost in (Lost In) Time
Lost in Space
Lost in time
Lost in space

How could I know, how could i (how could i) know
How could I know, How could I know
That I'll get lost in space to roam for ever

How could I now, how could I see
feeling like lost in space to roam forever

Forever...
Forever...
Lost in space
Lost in time......

1. Stargazers
[Scarecrow]
We have roamed the plains a million years
Gathered at the shore
When we had run out off all fears

[Inspiration]
We have come from everywhere
Crumbling worlds behind
Reason is what we're gonna give
To be given peace of mind

[Mephistopheles]
Crimson is the pavement
Blood is dripping from our dreams
To the sound of smashing yesterdays
We dance in ecstasy

[Scarecrow]
Oh craving devour me, take me away
Oh to infinity, take me away

[Mephistopheles]
Take me away
Oh yeah take me away
Far away

[Scarecrow]
Don't you turn your face to the night sky
Said the fainthearted one
You may see through the charades
An instant that won't come undone

I can feel the ease of my pain
Decline of the blood reason level
Gazing in awe bystanders scream
Mentally critical fettle

[Mentor]
We're sailing on gentle waves
We read the sky

Stargazers, stargazers
Behold the key
Stargazers, stargazers
Infinity
Reason left behind

[Scarecrow]
Where are you detecting the wrongs
Spirit that always denies
I've gone insane
Release me from waiting
For the sparkle to rise

[Mephistopheles]
I can see they're nailed to the cross
Cannot live till they're gone
Immortal they cry on terrestrial embers
While they laugh at the clown

[Mentor]
You feel a chill as if time stood still
There's no way out

Stargazers, stargazers
Behold the key
Stargazers, stargazers
For a lucid dream
You'll leave the world behind

[Scarecrow]
Oh craving devour me
Release me, please, take me away
To infinity, oh take me away
Craving devour me
Take me, take me away

[Mentor]
Stargazers, stargazers
Behold the key
Stargazers, stargazers
Infinity, reason left behind

[Darkness]
When the sun rose to wake another day
they were gone, gone without a trace
Babylon, craving in lucidity
Babylon, the fire will remain

And the sun razes from their memory
What the dark had cyphered in the sky
And the flame's burning their lucidity
Babylon, rise up to the night

[Mephistopheles]
Oh, let us wander
let us wander between the worlds
We override their principles
Abrogate horizons
Abandon mental gravity
Oh, we overrule the eye
Compromise your sanity
To heaven
To hell

2. Angel Of Babylon
[Scarecrow]
You turn off the light
And you won't make no difference
You hear the echoes fade away
When the cries of despair
Turn to a sound in distance
The road ain't divine
Black are the wings that will carry me home

[Mephistopheles]
Tower in the night, up to the sky
Carry our remains, angel of light
To the dark side of Paradise

[Scarecrow]
On wings of fire to the back side of light
From Babylon to Paradise I crawl
I've seen iniquity galore
Been worth a detour and some more
The snake in the backyard of heaven

Venus guiding to the back door of love
From Babylon to Paradise we're drawn
I've seen iniquity galore
Been worth a detour and some more
The snake in the backyard of heaven

I feel how I faint as I'm crossing the Acheron
Wash away my innocence
Was I losing my way
When the sky has been blackened
This short cut of evil
Where do they drive me?
Where will I go?

Days gone by, time after time
I'm going insane, losing my mind
To the dark side of Paradise

On wings of fire to the back side of light
From Babylon to Paradise I crawl
I've seen iniquity galore
Been worth a detour and some more
The snake in the backyard of heaven

Venus guiding to the back door of love
From Babylon to Paradise I'm drawn
I've seen iniquity galore
Been worth a detour and some more
The snake in the backyard of heaven

On wings of fire to the back side of light
From Babylon to Paradise I crawl
I've seen iniquity galore
Been worth a detour and some more
The snake in the backyard of heaven

Venus guiding to the back door of love
From Babylon to Paradise I'm drawn
On through shadows, I've seen iniquity galore
Been worth a detour and some more
The snake in the backyard of heaven

3. Your Love Is Evil
> [Scarecrow]
Day after day I see her smile
If you could see her through my eyes
You wouldn't call her a little boy's fever dream

How can you tell my feelings wrong?
How can't you see it's growing strong?
Silicone angel, you are my fantasy

Your eyes are cold
Pale are your skin and your lips
Pale is your desire

You are the one
Day after day under your spell
And you look away
Your love is evil

You are the one
Day after day
You are the rain
I'm the parade
Though your love is evil

I feel how you watch my every move
Why do you lie to me? And you
Your languidness shining through a crystal wall

Nobody would touch you like I would
Nobody would stop us
If I could reach out through the glass
Pretend you don't hear my call

Your eyes are cold
Pale are your skin and your lips
Pale is your desire

You are the one
Day after day under your spell
And you look away
'Cause your love is evil

You are the one
Day after day
Under your spell
And you look away
Though your love is evil

[Solo]

You are the one
Day after day under your spell
And you look away
Your love is evil

You are the one
Day after day
You are the rain
Still I'm the parade
Though your love is evil

4. Death Is Just A Feeling
[Madman]
Living in the darkness
What a cold and lonely night
Voices in the darkness
Sing a sweet sweet lullaby

Something's coming nearer
Anyone to join in a game, a game?
Welcome to the attic
Hospitality is my name

Eyes so alive
I've been feeling pretty dead for quite a while
Gimme a smile

Dead and alive
Come a little closer
You and I:
Affiliates forevermore
And I'm alive
Death is just a feeling
You and I, swapping finitude and love for diamonds
I'm just a little pale

Don't hesitate to sign right here
Don't be afraid to come with me
Specialized in temporizing
Dead to faulty love and time, faulty time
We'll be dancing here forever and a while
Day by day

Dead and alive
Come a little closer
You and I:
Affiliates forevermore
And I'm alive
Death is just a feeling
You and I, swapping finitude and love for diamonds

[Scarecrow]
Value by value
I'm gonna turn into breath after breath
Love we trade in for silver
Defy what they use to call death
And dust covered treasures will shine again
An unseen accolade
Larger than life, a memory
Death will be just a charade

[Madman]
Dead and alive
Come a little closer
You and I:
Affiliates forevermore
And I'm alive
Death is just a feeling
You and I, swapping finitude and love for diamonds
I'm just a little pale

5. Rat Race
[Mephistopheles]
There'll be fireworks tonight
Everybody's on their knees
Admiration for the one
Riot in a dead-end street
Don't be afraid to hear his voice
Tells you lies you wanna hear

[Scarecrow]
You just listen and obey
Got the ticket in your hand
A new religion for the mob
For everyone to understand
We're all just clockwork toys tonight
And salvation is drawing near

The snow covered opera tonight
Enchanted with dilated eyes

Living in a rat race
Dying in a rat race
Burning in the stream again
Why should I dare to break away

Living in a rat race
Living in a rat race

I got sulfur in my veins
Devil watching through my eyes
I got beauty, I got brains
And there's no one to defy
I've got the power in my fingers
And the opera in my hands

The onset of winter tonight
The mirror, it gives me a smile

Living in a rat race
Dying in the rat race
Burning in the stream again
Why should I dare to break away

Speeding in the rat race
Bleeding in the rat chase
Burning in the stream again
Why should I dare to break away

Living in the rat race
Dying in the race
Burning in the stream again
Why should I dare to break away

Speeding in the rat race
Bleeding in the rat chase
Burning in the stream again
Why should I dare to break away

6. Down In The Dark
[Mephistopheles]
All of a tremble
You can feel their poison arrows
Have left their mark
Higher and higher
Wanna seize the day
While you're waiting for the dark

You're running from the disdain
You know this time
You won't turn around
Chasing an illusion, disillusion
Desire leading, downward bound

Into the black
You are tracing the riddle
Where no man's been
No turning back
No more lost in the middle
Never again, never again
Once you have opened your eyes
Down in the dark you'll be crossing the line

[Scarecrow]
I'm a believer on the receiving end
Of the bat they hold with grace
Dead to the voices of the anxious
Timid of him who must not be named

Enticing me away now as the sun sets
To the truth that lies beyond
I'm chasing an illusion, an illusion
Revelation, I'm coming home

Into the black
You are tracing the riddle
Where no man's been
No turning back
No more lost in the middle
Never again, never again
Once you have opened your eyes
Down in the dark you'll be crossing the line

You turn your back on the one
Willing to make up his mind
No, you never stood in my shoes
Evil versus divine
You're feeling drawn to purity
Like a moth to the flame
Light at the end of the tunnel
Strange how the voice of the savior
Roars like a train

Into the black
You are tracing the riddle
Where no man's been
No turning back
No more lost in the middle
Never again, never again
Once you have opened your eyes
Down in the dark you'll be crossing the line

7. Blowing Out The Flame
[Scarecrow]
I sold my soul for diamonds
And reason for acclaim
Been begging for white angels
To blow my mind away

Been growing funny flowers
Where roses never grew
I stayed awake all night
When I woke up from dreams of me and you

I tried to take the sun and I went blind
God help me to erase you from my mind

I'm growing cold
And the night is yet to come

Can anyone tell me is this
The way it's meant to be?
Lost and isolated
I'm way too complicated
For you to lean on me
I play a losing game
I cried in desperation
Mental devastation
I'm blowing out the flame

Self-pity gave me shelter
I always hid away in vice
Dyslexic, torn and tattered
I tried to read the signs

You never tried to take a look at the one I'd have died to be
Now it seems you don't see me at all

Was it all worth it? Visions holding sway
When the real thing got lost along the way

Yes anyone tell me is this
The way it's meant to be?
I'm lost and isolated
Way too complicated
For you to lean on me
I play a losing game
I cried in desperation
Mental devastation
I'm blowing out the flame

Yes anyone tell me is this
The way it's meant to be
Lost and isolated
I'm way too complicated
For you to lean on me
I play a losing game
I cried in desperation
Mental devastation
I'm blowing out the flame

8. Symphony Of Life
[Other]
Tonight, tonight, tonight
Heal me, heal me

Yes in the darkness of the night
I know there's someone near me
I can't explain but it's all right
As long as this won't leave me

I give to you my sacrifice
My virgin creed, my passion
I'm torn in two but all my life, my life
My life I'll wait for you

To near me
And reveal me

Rush tonight
We play the darkest of all symphonies
And in a flash of light
Then it'll all become the symphony of life
Of life, my life

Heal me

And in the deepness of my dreams
I know it's you that haunts me
In blood I swear my purity
And save my treasures for you

I give to you my sacrifice
And lay my burden down
Am I deranged that all my life, my life
My life I wait for you?

To cease me
And release me

Rush tonight
We play the darkest of all symphonies
And in a flash of light
Then it'll all become the symphony of life
Of life, my life

You haunt me, chase me like a beast
And with a taste so bittersweet
You love me, grieve me 'til I'm mad
Now is the moment

Rush tonight
We play the darkest of all symphonies
And in a flash of light
Then it'll all become the symphony of life
Of life, of life...

Rush tonight
We play the darkest of all symphonies
And in a flash of light
Then it'll all become the symphony of life
Of life, my life

9. Alone I Remember
[Scarecrow]
I've been walking down this road
With a suitcase full of dreams
I've seen my demons come and go
To show me what I need

Madness, walking dynamite
Been dancing on the edge
They got me by the fuse
Smiling with a match

I wanted love, I wanted life
Been striving for a new direction
I wanted out, I wanted more
I wanted to forget the damage left behind

But I recall the dream I had
When I kept moving on
Can't stand to remember

I recall
No turning back
Now I'm moving on
Alone I remember

[Mephistopheles]
Raise your head
Got stars above and emptiness below
Think of what you'd never had
And would have never known

You wanna turn your back on me
Condemn this pleasure dome
Make sure you won't regret
Mistaking friend for foe, no

You're at the gates,
You're on the edge,
I've seen them falling back to nowhere,
You're off the red, out of your head,
And you will wish you'd never seen it all

[Scarecrow]
I recall the dream I had
When I kept moving on
Can't stand to remember
I recall
No turning back
Now I'm moving on
Alone I remember

Oh, and I recall I used to have a dream
I won't forget that moment of glory

But I recall the dream I had
When I kept moving on
Can't stand to remember
I recall
No turning back
Now I'm moving on
Alone I remember

I recall the dream I had
When I kept moving on
Can't stand to remember

I recall the dream I had
When I kept moving on
Alone I remember

I recall, I recall the dream that I had
I recall
No turning back
Now I'm moving on
Alone I remember

10. Promised Land
[Scarecrow]
Hey redeemer
Now what's become on me
Taken in by promise
Awakening in grief

Collecting us like puppets
You instrumentalize
A frigid trepidation
In a million puppet eyes

[Mephistopheles]
God gave his word just to let us down
Where is he now?

You've been facing heaven
You were lost and left alone
You're welcome to my home and
Found another heaven
It was you who took my hand
Come into the promised land

You scratch my back and I scratch yours
It's you who makes decisions
I just open up the doors

Whining in the gutter
They forget their sanctity
Welcome to my clockwork
Vanity machinery

[Scarecrow]
You gave your word
You let me down
What am I now

You've been facing heaven
You were lost and left alone
You're welcome to my home and
Found another heaven
It was you who took my hand
Come into the promised land

[Scarecrow]
Oh, as far as the eye can see
They're bent in submission
Empty inside
An army of scarecrows like me
Thousands of broken dreams
Thousands of tragedies
Tried to run from their destiny

[Mephistopheles]
Like moths to a flame
Driven by vanity
They've been off to Jerusalem
Chasing a dream
Calling on me
Just trading in needs

You've been facing heaven
You were lost and left alone
You're welcome to my home and
Found another heaven
It was you who took my hand
Come into the promised land

You've been facing heaven
You were lost and left alone
You're welcome to my home
Found another heaven
It was you who took my hand
Come into the promised land

11. Journey To Arcadia
[Conscience]
A lonely boy, a handful of dreams
Cold wind blows through a heart wired-in
Open skies he would explore
No, there ain't no mastery
Of a passion and a deep blue love

Yearn to see far away places
One day he'd feel two hearts collide
In his eyes tears and desire
But he prays and he swears every night
One day scales will fall from her eyes

[Inspiration]
Just with a dream
Just with a dream and with a song
On my own, I may stumble and fall
It don't matter at all when you're blessed with
Just what's yet to come, what's yet to come

[All]
Burning feet on the ground
Got your head in the clouds
You're out to find Arcadia
And you know you will stand
What you can't comprehend
Journey to Arcadia

[Scarecrow]
The more I see, I understand
That there ain't nothing that I know
As I awake on padded ground
The final curtain of the show

When dogs run barking
And I don't hear no sound
And the sky is as blue
As eyes have never seen it
Then I remember
What I'd have been dying for
Faith, rescue my dream
From a role that I've been put in on their screen

[Inspiration]
Your eyes, and as I look into your eyes
We're at the crack of dawn
Life will stop telling lies
And destiny will know
It's just you and I

[All]
Burning feet on the ground
Got my head in the clouds
Journey to Arcadia
And I know I will stand
What I can't comprehend
Journey to Arcadia

[Conscience]
The more we see, we understand
That there's a lot that we don't know
As you awake on padded ground
The final curtain of the show

[Scarecrow]
Far from eye but close to heart
No matter how we try
Can't repel the counterpart
Our common bond we can't defy

[Inspiration]
I've seen them standing at the crossroads
When they were waiting for a sign
And they unlearned to face the silence
As they unlearned to turn inside

You're turning to the sky
And you're dying for an angel
If you want it bad enough, see those eyes
That's where two glances collide

Learn to breathe, learn to crawl
Learn to stand, walk and fall
Learn to lose and to love, to believe, to rise above
Love is more than to love

[All]
Burning feet on the ground
Got your head in the clouds
You're out to find Arcadia
And you know you will stand
What you can't comprehend
Journey to Arcadia

[Scarecrow]
The more I've seen, I understand
That there ain't nothing that I know now
As I awake on padded ground
The final curtain of the show

1. Spectres
[Music & lyrics by Tobias Sammet]

[Aaron Blackwell]
Through the shimmer on this cold alley paving
See the moonshine painting the ground
Cobble stones keeping tales that remain untold
More than ages old

Brewing mist like a shroud on the damp floor
Hear it whisper lucidity away
Ornate cold is the king of these streets tonight
The void is taking hold!

Make haste as the wind's getting colder
It's chasing the dreamer away.

Wide open minds will divine without reason
Cold is the night as you're braving the gale
Wide open eyes
A spectre is breezing through the moonlit sky

[Science & Zeitgeist]
See them guises on the prowl, what a show!
Feel them shadows drag you into a nightmare
To the melody of which you don't know
If it's really there

Dance in the gloom, dance in the gloom
Every move is a step to your tomb
We're the machine that's gonna make you dream
Phantasmagoria

[Aaron Blackwell]
Time flies from the space of an hour
Telling tales in the poorhouse they say...

Wide open minds will divine without reason
Cold is the night as you're braving the gale
Wide open eyes
A spectre is breezing through the moonlit sky

[Lead Guitar: Sascha Paeth]

[Aaron Blackwell]
Wide open minds will divine without reason
Cold is the night as you're braving the gale
Wide open eyes and a spectre is breezing
Cold is the night as you're braving the gale
Wide open minds - once upon the moonlit night...

2. The Watchmakers' Dream
[Music & lyrics by Tobias Sammet]

[Science]
Welcome to the aftermath of the incidence
That made the tower fall
Another screw to another wheel
For another mind won't stray away anymore
Oh won't stray away from its brain
Oh no...

We must finalise the giant
To level off the void and zeroise the will
The time will come: you will know what you need

The Watchmakers' Dream
The Watchmakers' Dream

[Aaron Blackwell]
Simplify simplicity
You don't mind what you don't see at all

[Science]
The tongue of nations brought in line
Reason occupied: the God-machine oh
A splendid steaming dram will tower to the sky

[Aaron Blackwell]
We'll exploit another 'morrow
We drained another day
The glowing of the future in our eyes
And time will reveal what we need:

The Watchmakers' Dream
The Watchmakers' Dream

[Lead Guitar: Arjen Anthony Lucassen]

[Lead Organ: Ferdy Doernberg]

[Science]
We must finalise the giant
To zeroise the will and level off all minds
The time will come that you
will know what you need

[Aaron Blackwell]
The Watchmakers' Dream
The Watchmakers' Dream

[Science]
The Watchmakers' Dream - Will we slice infinity
The Watchmakers' Dream - For all the world to see
The Watchmakers' Dream - We give you what you need
The Watchmakers' Dream - The sound of triviality

3. Black Orchid
[Music & lyrics by Tobias Sammet]

[Aaron Blackwell]
I never wanted guidance
To tell me where to find
A light in the darkness
Cause the dark I'd push aside
No time for dreaming of a distant Paradise
No time for tales of good and evil

[Reason]
Another correlation: as above so below
Another analysing where illusions fail to show
the face of the maker who'd leave you alone
without a sense of comprehension

[Aaron Blackwell]
When the meadow - in front of my eyes - will have dried away
Will my senses wither like flowers on my grave
Will this wave of becoming flow into the void of time

The final hour:
When Never and Now become one
Will I find the orchid
The final hour:
Door to the garth of eternity?
Or withered orchid meadows?

[Reason]
Everybody's praying
But what if God is just a threat
and everybody's straying?
If only they would just forget
everybody's craving
for a ghost light in the haye:
You'll lose your minds one after another

[Aaron Blackwell]
Everybody's craving
for what doesn't have a name or a face
So reason could fit it in the frame
In quest of the orchid:
A glimmer in the daze
Till I awake to the sound of rigour

[Reason]
What if that meadow in your mind is just a fantasy?
And if it wanted to be seen why must you believe?

[Aaron Blackwell]
Will this wave of becoming flow into the void of time

[Reason]
The final hour
When Never and Now become one

[Aaron Blackwell]
Will I find the orchid

[Reason]
The final hour
Door to the garth of eternity

[Aaron Blackwell]
Or withered orchid meadows

Black orchid
Strange and beautiful
Oh black orchid I must find you

[Reason]
I remember that morning
He had to be told
What he couldn't remember
After he'd spoken to the wall

[Aaron Blackwell]
And I gave to repression
What I must not have seen
What even believers
Must unlearn to unbelieve

[Lead Guitar: Bruce Kulick]

[Aaron Blackwell]
The final hour
When Never and Now become one
Will I find the orchid
The final hour
Door to the garth of eternity

[Reason]
Or withered orchids
The final hour
When Never and Now become one

[Aaron Blackwell]
Will I find the orchid

[Reason]
The final hour
Door to the garth of eternity

[Aaron Blackwell]
Or withered black orchid meadows

4. Where Clock Hands Freeze
[Music & lyrics by Tobias Sammet]

You're caught in the land of no sun
Without reason or rhyme
You're avid for splendour
The spin of the hand is your pace on the run
We got no time to turn
When we strive after grandeur

Here you got your hero slicing up your ecstasy
On the verge of lunacy
There's no time to lose
No chance to refuse - ah

Will you deny what you see
(as you) tear down the nature of reason
That has shown you the way
Where clock hands freeze

I know what I see
And I know what I don't
Through your dark swamp
I walk on deductive conclusion

A little more time?
I admit I would take
But then again
It would mean more time for confusion

You think you got your prodigy
Everytime your eyes don't see
Victim of perplexity
There's no time to lose
No need to refuse

Will you deny what you see
Tear down our nature of reason
That has shown you the way
Where clock hands freeze

Will you deny what you see
Tear down our nature of reason
That has shown you the way
Where clock hands freeze

5. Sleepwalking
[Music & lyrics by Tobias Sammet]

Wandering barefoot into nowhere
Just another winter's night
And I don't fell gravity anymore
You'd never lie, never cry
Never talk me out of dreams
And a dream is what remains

Tell me don't you see what ain't there
When you look in the mirror
You're starving away like a candle burning down
Miles, away miles away
You've been cutting off the rope
Letting go and losing ground

And I…
Wonder who's to blame
As I…
Sleepwalk in the rain
It's my, my silent victory over gravity
And I…
Sleepwalk in the rain

Winter sky far and wide 
Caving in on you and me
Like a brittle wall of the emerald room:
The hall of fame and dying dreams
The love we'd die for: Petrified
I wanna know: Does a frozen river flow

And I…
Wonder who's to blame
As I…
Sleepwalk in the rain
It's my, my silent victory over gravity
And I…
Sleepwalk in the rain

And I…
Wonder who's to blame
As I…
Sleepwalk in the rain
It's my, my silent victory over gravity
And I…
Sleepwalk in the rain

6. Savior In The Clockwork
[Music & lyrics by Tobias Sammet]

I envision how you lie awake and agonise
Over ways to bear your day just every night
Re-alignment you're in need of so imploringly
It's the pace that we'll maintain for you

Oh every moment everybody's gonna think alike
Every second will be seized
While every in between we'll erase
To take the tangle from their memory
Maximising one and all for you

Now into line bring them peace of mind
Mind by mind
Se the pace for all mankind
Let us take away the spaces
In between their given time

Time to run!
Savior in the clockwork tell me
For how long will I wait on the grind
Time flies on 
(Time will fly on)
Savior in the clockwork take me back inside
In between the time

Now am I half asleep or half unconscious, 
Half 'adream'?
I can't move as I am stuck in bright lucidity
I can feel and hear and see
But I won't comprehend
I see fire that I won't decipher

I see giant evil tower to a blackened sky
I feel blessed with evidence of what I can't define
Swinging blade of the lowering perpendicular
I see clarity I won't remember

Do I dream
Is it only fantasy and matter just a thought I see
And time is all they need to seal away eternity

Time to run!
Savior in the clockwork tell me
For how long will I wait on the grind
Time flies on 
(Time will fly on)
Savior in the clockwork take me back inside
In between the time

You pry into a world too far above
Your head up in the haze
Journey to the birth of the first sun
Into the black womb of space
Father primal space oh yeah
Who's drawn the light…

Standing at the door to epiphanic realisation
A journey to the centre of forever
To the mystery of creation

Don't you hear the voice: I'm with you
I'm everywhere and real
You can see me, you can hear me without credence
I'm what your hands can feel

God, I feel I've been away too long
I feel like I've been dreaming

If you'd open up your door to explanation
You would hear the voice of reason screaming

I've seen the ocean swallow the ancient harmony
And I've seen belief and craving swallow sanity

I feel my hand is led to ink between the lines
Tall stories legendising: figments of the lie

At crack of dawn hazy remains above my mind
Raise your mind
I scribble down those icons that I can't define
Will they demand account as I'd demand myself
Raise your mind
I'll never testify what no man comprehends

And they will tear to pieces what they can't define
Raise your mind
If you don't follow your self- preservation drive
They'll crucify the one who won't affiliate
Raise your mind
But decorate the children of their own ego's way

Time to run savior in the clockwork
Tell me for how long will I wait on the grind
Time flies on
(time will fly on)
Savior in the clockwork

Take me back inside
In between the time
Time to run!
Savior in the clockwork tell me
For how long will I wait on the grind
Time flies on 
(Time will fly on)
Savior in the clockwork take me back inside
In between the time

7. Invoke The Machine
[feat. Ronnie Atkins][Music & lyrics by Tobias Sammet]

[Tobias Sammet]:
Home to the land of the living
Roused by a sound I confide
And what am I to cast my tired eyes upon
Where was I when the clock had been alive?

[Ronnie Atkins]:
I see marvel right in front of me
There's a man, who's got tomorrow in his hands
Don't you see what you are meant to be
Outside your cloud-cuckoo-land

[Tobias Sammet]:
Time won't wait for those who stay behind
To wait for time
In this tangible realms hesitation's a crime

[Chorus]
In the Night:
A secret mysterious dream
Dead of night, while the town lies asleep
We invoke the machine

[Ronnie Atkins]:
Those dreams that you
Hummed to yourself once
How far will you reach out
To make them come true

Will you turn around 
To shirk from duty
Or force the pace
While it's all up to you

[Tobias Sammet]:
A giant leap is to be made now
I'm struck with awe
We're gonna heed the inner call
My heart beat quicken
I behold the god-machine
I can't help but write history

As my glance wanders
To the far off end in the sky
Far off end end in the sky
Hissing and screaming, almost alive

In the night
My life came apart at the seams
Dead of the night, let's run up the wheel
We invoke the machine

In the Night:
A secret mysterious dream
Dead of night, the town lies asleep, whoa
We invoke the machine

In the night
Those in hiding are waiting for me
Dead of night, let's run up the wheel
We invoke the machine

8. What's Left Of Me
[Music & lyrics by Tobias Sammet]

I think of the days
I was thrilled by this road ahead
When the moment won over what was to come
Not afraid of the distance but the distance afraid of me
Everytime I made it there I found nothing
The distance was gone

Now, I don't wanna fade
But I ain't gonna run
I'm resting my head on these stones
God, what have you done to you and me
I'm tired of scaring the future away
No road ahead, the fire is dead
Father don't you see in front of you
Is what the chase has left of me

If only they told me
What the kerbside was hiding away
Where the angels from high street didn't want to go
And a heartbeat is forced
To resign to the glory of a commonplace
I am jaded

I don't wanna see what's becoming of me
Here's a bit! Then spare me this sight now…
Cut it out I'm tired of the future myself

I don't wanna fade but I ain't gonna run
I'm resting my head on these stones
God, what have you done to you and me
I'm tired of scaring the future away
No road ahead, the fire is dead
Father don't you see 
In front of you is what's left of me

God and glory torn to pieces,
No no, it's just the spirit of the times
I'm drawn to a flame that won't release me
Release me!
And I see a thousand who wait in line

I don't wanna face what I ain't gonna stand
I'm resting my head on these stones
God, what have you done 
Look at yourself! I'm tired of scaring the future away
The dark road ahead, the fire is dead
Father don't you see what you have made of me

9. Dweller In A Dream
[Music & lyrics by Tobias Sammet]

The dial by the night
Seems like what it used to be
But now that this town has fallen silent
I feel memories
Of good intentions ghosting me

Watch the tower clock hand
Cut instants off each hour
From a future that has been devoured
Already by their craving for the vague
And even after lucid heartbeats
Few and far between
We're back to gain admission to the wheel

Bending the boundaries
Deaf to the memories
We won't make in the rush anyway
And God if you'r out there
Why do you make me spin your wheel?

Do you hear me
Dweller I a dream

You're lost in the no-zone

A twilight mover
Primal screams

Are crying for the dweller in a dream

The study and a sage
And ancient brazen luminaire
Just a bat flap from answers they wanna hear
They're evident
To every cynic eminent

Movement around the sun
All in eternal time
The heaven's fires turned to light
The moon that governs birth and then decay
The principle decreed
By laws you think you will conceive
And then some accident 
To throw it all in place!?

Bending the boundaries
Don't run from your memories
I have been there before

Aroe you fro real now
Or just a dweller in my dream

Do you hear me
Dweller in a dream

You're lost in the no-zone

A twilight mover
Primal screams

Are crying for the dweller in a dream

Oh, why would your
God give road lead to ruin?
Why would science challenge facts?
Why would your
God given will come off the track?
Come of the track?
Dweller in a dream?

Father do you hear me
Dweller in a dream

You're lost in the no-zone

A twilight mover
Primal screams

Are crying for the
Dweller in a dream

Do you hear me
Dweller in a dream

10. The Great Mystery
[Music & lyrics by Tobias Sammet]

How could I let it get this far?
To the edge I've been drawn by promises
And what's the reason
For a heart to only misguide me
Blind me, tear myself apart?

When darkness falls and silence talks
At the edge of thoughts that you memorised
I'm the truth between the lines
They read and deny me and tie me to fantasy
And they'll curse this darkest hour
When in oblivion I'll die

Oh will you make me turn the page, one after another
If only you would make a mark the eye can see

You're dancing in around
Through the dark you long to find
Alight at the midnight t sky
To persuade the night

Don't leave me blind, give me one sign
Grant me just one look into the mystery behind
Fire and flames, heartache and pain:
You break me just to make me feel like a golden child
What if it's nothing but a dream
The great mystery, great mystery

We carry the flame to accelerate
The evolution of an age
Cast your eyes into the crystal ball - alright
We embrittle the weak that is0nt meant to be
We're gonna make it coronate the chosen ones
Who never sinned against their vocation

Don't be afraid: just look around
Don't question what your eyes can see

Don't leave me blind, give me one sign
Grant me just one look into the mystery behind
Fire and flames, heartache and pain:
Iv'e borne from my devotion

Oh she won't see me, she won't feel me
She's lost on her won, and so am I?

I see a cold moon rise above those empty streets
And I see movements part their lives
I hear the ticking leaving scars you can't conceal
Ain't it poignant how you try

Impatiently they're giving up on hearts
Whose signs they cannot read
As silence doesn't talk, eternity will cease

And as you marvel at the artwork in your hands
Rick in detail, so frail and beautiful
And you forget the rules
The elder's always made up for you
To save you precious time

You watch them pile up, they are saving on and on
Even you don't know where they store it all
You've got to be a fool if you don't save along
A thousand screaming
And silence doesn't speak to thousands screaming
No, silence doesn't wanna speak…

And I see tears shed over days when all was good
A child didn't care for what never really mattered

I see tears shed over days
When all was good and time
They had a lot to give away
When their hearts had eyes to see
And the final mystery
Was more than a fancy tale
And answers you did find
To dare what you would find inside, no

Don't leave me blind, give me one sign
Grant me just one look into the mystery behind
Fire and flames, heartache and pain: you break me just to make me feel like a golden child
Don't leave me blind, give me one sing
Grant me just one look into the mystery behind
Fire and flames, heartache and pain:
You break me just to make me feel like a golden child
Don't leave me blind, send a sing
Oh is it really not a dream?
The great mystery

11. The Cross And You
[Bonus Track]Screaming - in silence you must carry
your secrets down this lonely eerie wicked road
Screaming - you're oh so battle weary
They say it's lonely at the top
Let alone when you hit the ground

All ablaze - you're rushing down the tightrope
With your only mean companion ticking away

You gotta stand your ground
Forge into a fiery fierce tomorrow
Stand your ground
At the speed of light into the void
Hell is what you've gotta make it through
Until it's just the cross and you

The cross and you
The cross and you

Screaming from behind the mask of reason
The cautionary voice that shatters your brain
The silvery gleam of tomorrow
Keep accelerating in quest for a break
Until you realize that it's too late

All ablaze - you're rushing down the tightrope
With your only mean companion ticking away

You gotta stand your ground
Forge into a fiery fierce tomorrow
Stand your ground
At the speed of light into the void
Hell is what you've gotta make it through
Until it's just the cross and you

All ablaze I plough my way
Till I am allowed to fall
I pay my dues on a ship of fools
I kick and scream and fight and crawl

Get a life! Don't waste time!
As we drown the voice inside
Till the moment I awake
When it's just the cross and me

[Solo: Sascha Paeth]

You gotta stand your ground
Forge into a fiery fierce tomorrow
Stand your ground
At the speed of light into the void

You gotta stand your ground
Forge into a fiery fierce tomorrow
Stand your ground
At the speed of light into the void
Hell's the shortcut you're rushing through
Just the cross and you

12. Death Is Just A Feeling
[Bonus Track]Living in the darkness
What a cold and lonely night
Voices in the darkness
Sing a sweet sweet lullaby

Something's coming nearer
Anyone to join in game? A game
Welcome to the attic
Hospitality is my name

Eyes so alive
I've been feeling pretty dead
For quite a while
Gimme a smile

Dead-and-alive
Come a little closer
You and I:
Affiliates forevermore and I'm alive
Death is just a feeling
You and I swapping finitude
And love for diamonds
I'm just a little pale

Don't hesitate to sign right here
Don't be afraid to come with me
Specialized in temporizing
Dead to faulty love and time

Faulty time
We'll be dancing right here
Forever and a while
Day by day

Dead-and-alive
Come a little closer
You and I:
Affiliates forevermore and I'm alive
Death is just a feeling
You and I swapping finitude
And love for diamonds

Value by value
I'm gonna turn into breath after breath
Love we trade in for silver
Defy what they use to call death
And dust covered treasures will shine again
An unseen accolade
Larger than life, a memory
Death will be just a charade

Dead-and-alive
Come a little closer
You and I:
Affiliates forevermore and I'm alive
Death is just a feeling
You and I swapping finitude
And love for diamonds
I'm just a little pale

1. The Wicked Symphony
[Scarecrow]
You'll be running out of miracles
Like I'm running out of dreams
Madness lurking into my left
Angels faint in front of me

And I see eyes to the right
I hear a promise resound
Gold and diamonds, love and fame
And music meant to remain

[Inspiration]
You've been dying for glory
You've been looking for love
Why don't we read the signs
When we're about to get lost

[Mephistopheles]
A seeker enthralled by a flame
Eventually home to his pain
The Great Unbeloved
You reach for the final stage

[All]
Hey man in your hideaway
Where do we go from here
Heroes in the tragedy
Down-home just a memory
Where do we go
When the world gets in the way

Way down to the hide away
Afflatus divine! Your hands
And a wicked symphony
Hey now to the hideaway
Lock up the rain for a wicked symphony

[Mephistopheles]
Don't you give up on your emotions
Don't you abandon your despair
If you deny what you desire
This will have been just a mystery play

There'll be nowhere to go
Just oblivion, we're so close to reach out
Close to fall, make up or break up or crawl

[Inspiration]
You are striving for beauty
For a song to remain
A final touch and the spirit you have cited
Holds on to the reins

[Scarecrow]
I feel how I'm losing my ground
A dancer enthralled by a sound
The smoke clears away
I'll reach for the final stage

[All]
Hey man in your hideaway
Where do we go from here
Heroes in the tragedy
Down-home just a memory
Where do we go
When the world gets in the way

Way down to the hide away, afflatus Divine!
Your hands and a wicked symphony
Hey now to the hideaway
Lock up the rain for a wicked symphony

[Scarecrow]
Oh I can hear it, I can hear it
Oh I can hear it, I, I, I, I...
I can hear it, yeah
I'm dying for a sign

You can turn your face away
Can pretend you don't hear it
How long have you been begging on your knees
And now that you're near it
Won't you be damned if you defy what you're given
Mercury of salvation
The colors for the eyes of the world
We'll be kings for generations

[All]
Hey man in your hideaway
Where do we go from here
Heroes in the tragedy
Down-home just a memory
Where do we go
When the world gets in the way

Way down to the hide away
Afflatus divine!
Your hands and a wicked symphony
Hey now to the hideaway
Lock up the rain for a wicked symphony

2. Wastelands
[Mentor]
A moment of glory
The blink of an eye and it's all gone
You hide in confinement
Dark is the cell that you call home

We pretend to be blind
Every time it hurts to see

You - you close your eyes
To blink the night away
At ease in the wastelands
You - you're dead and blind
You sanctify the way
Blindfold in the wastelands

[Scarecrow]
Don't tell me in pain
The end doesn't justify the means
Spado, ascetic
It's easy to sermonize in jealousy

Now I'm off to life
I'm changing sides
Your final goodbye

You - you close your eyes
To blink the tears away
Love hurts in the wastelands
You - you're old and blind
You sacrifice it all
Lost in the wastelands

[Mentor]
You - you close your eyes
To blink the night away
At ease in the wastelands
You - you're dead and blind
You sanctify the way
Blindfold in the wastelands

3. Scales Of Justice
[Fury]
Predetermination, belief
Veracity of incidents
Reconciliation
Between justice and tomorrow
You're innocent

It's only human to just close your eyes
Blinding fury, part of paradise
Heaven justifies

[All]
To take your eyes off the drag
Walking to the block
At the scaffold scales held even
take your eyes off the drag
Walking to the block
Look away, scales held even

[Fury]
You owe the power and your pace
To the brute that's running after you
Humiliation's growing hate
Righteous anger driving you

[Scarecrow]
Cut off the hand
That tries to keep me back
Blinding fury, a piece of paradise
Cause heaven justifies

[All]
To take your eyes off the drag
Walking to the block
At the scaffold scales held even
To take your eyes off the drag
Walking to the block
Look away, scales held even

[Fury]
Just close your eyes, just look away
What you don't want to know
Ain't gonna hurt you
Time passes by, we all die anyway
And no, nothing remains
Whatever you say, whatever you do

[All]
To take your eyes off the drag
Walking to the block
At the scaffold scales held even
To take your eyes off the drag
Walking to the block
Look away, scales held even

4. Dying For An Angel
[Scarecrow]
You're awake in your darkest dream
I have come for you

[Future Scarecrow]
And nobody can hear you scream
When I reach for you

[Scarecrow]
Don't you remember their feet in your face
Before they have carved you in stone

[Future Scarecrow]
And don't you remember your sweat and your pain
When you were drawn to the bone
When you were left all alone

[All]
Living on a dream
Dying for an angel
Reach out, waiting for a miracle
No sign of wings, as you turn your back on me

Living on a dream
Lonely, cold and dire
Head up, feet down in the fire
Give until you're gone
Dying for an angel
Everyday

[Scarecrow]
Where do we go from the apogee
What do we leave behind
And how will I stand what I'll have to see
This reflection of mine

[Future Scarecrow]
Collateral damage, your sacrifice
Gotta learn to fly and learn to fall
Gonna tear down the walls of love and lies
You have come on your own
You will go on all alone

[All]
Living on a dream
Dying for an angel
Reach out, waiting for a miracle
No sign of wings, as you turn your back on me

Living on a dream
Lonely, cold and dire
Head up, feet down in the fire
Give until you're gone
Dying for an angel
Everyday

5. Blizzard On A Broken Mirror
[Acedia]
Faces in this empty room
Cited in despair
Gazes that I had invoked
They're driving me insane now
Walls have eyes, they're staring down on me
From everywhere around

[Scarecrow]
In the face of dreams I had
Grimaces of pain
Now I am turning helpless
Callous and alone
Waiting for a storm to brew
To wash my dream of love and sins away

[Acedia]
I'm with you
I'm the other side
You just gotta try
Fly now! No one's gonna care
Cause no one's gonna know
What no one's ever seen

[Scarecrow]
Close your eyes now
Kingdom on the broken mirror
Close your eyes now
Blizzard on the broken mirror
The scent of goodbye
They're dying away: the sands of time
Sands of time

[Acedia]
Fortune favors just the brave
That's what the blessed always say
Love will come in time
But I'm always late

I pray the wine my will to take
And those evil hands to tie
Wreaking havoc, baneful sight is growing dim

Tie the dream, I've had my fill
Raze the love and tie my will
Fires ploughing up my head
Oh forgive, I will forget

Lord, you're hiding in the haze?
The seventh door I'll try is daze
Angel send another storm to face another dawn

[Scarecrow]
Close your eyes now
Kingdom on the broken mirror
Close your eyes now
Blizzard on the broken mirror
The scent of goodbye
They're dying away: the sands of time

Close your eyes now
Kingdom on the broken mirror
Close your eyes now
Blizzard on the broken mirror
The scent of goodbye
They're dying away: the sands of time

6. Runaway Train
[Conscience]
Goodbye
Your pocket full of dreams
Your mind in a daze
Keep on chasing rainbows
Fly high
Leave the past behind
The dark road you take bears no escape

[Mephistopheles]
In a world of grand illusions
Where love is just a dream
You gotta make your sacrifices
Time to pick your poison

The fool is he who is noble-minded
And bellies up to poverty
He's not a king in the world of diamonds
Paling into oblivion

[Scarecrow]
I lay down my soul for glory
I've given a life away
Don't know if I am sorry
Blind me, blind me

Don't know where I'll be going
I gotta get away
From the pain of recollection
Drawn into the faint

[All]
Hang on to a runaway train
No turning back
Tethered to a runaway train
Take me away
Torpid in the wind and rain
No turning back
Hang on to a runaway train
Take me away

[Scarecrow]
If I'm a stranger to myself
Then I better gotta stay away
Even better gotta get away, get away
Time to pick my poison

Feel the devil sitting in my neck
Straight ahead into the unknown
Oh father I forgive you for I
Don't know what I'm doing

[Mephistopheles]
It's only human nature
To keep away from pain
Take a train to ecstasy oh
Ride on, ride on

Inhale the scent of heaven
Respire the smell of fame
You've been to hell and back
You can't change things anyway, no

[Scarecrow]
I hang on to a runaway train
No turning back
Tethered to a runaway train
Take me away
Torpid in the wind and rain
No turning back
I hang on to a runaway train
Take me away

[Mentor]
Reaching out to rule the world
you'll watch the mirror shatter
As you'll be dazzled by the sight
Once only diamonds mattered

How can you justify the way
When you wake up screaming
Will you pretend that you were blind
When you were really seeing

Your image everywhere
The looking glass: a sheet of ice
It's thick enough to dance on
In a frozen realm of lies

But the ice will break
And you will scream repenting
Oh boy, the ice will break
You'll just feel your heart rending

[Scarecrow]
Riding on to a world of funny flowers
Riding on to the white wide world
If coming back would hurt my pride
I'd rather take another ride
Riding on, winter on the mirror
Riding on into the unknown
If I'll awake in pain one day
I've gotta catch just one more train

[Conscience]
Days gone by
Who'd wanna live forever
On our knees up your road
Paved with good intentions
Fly high
Where angels can't breathe no more
Some dare to go blind
Some stay behind

[Scarecrow]
I hang on to a runaway train
No turning back
Tethered to a runaway train
Take me away
Torpid in the wind and rain
No turning back
I hang on to a runaway train
Take me away

Hang on to a runaway train
No turning back
Tethered to a runaway train
Take me away
Torpid in the wind and rain
in the wind and rain
I hang on to that runaway train

7. Crestfallen
[Scarecrow]
Ill-defined as I look in the mirror
Am I blind, am I blind
Am I given or just a straying fool
Feel it near
Something's here to watch

I feel their eyes sending shivers down my spine
Evil eyes, evil eyes
See me crawling as I'm falling off the edge
Paralyze, tantalize

Feel it there
From everywhere it sounds

And you'll fall away from heaven
Once you know you can't take no more of it
You will fall away from heaven
By the time you can see the crime against you

[Mephistopheles]
Hey - desperation
Angels crashing from the sky
How can you hold on to your way
In your mental disarray
I am your struggles
The answer to your pain
I am the fury in your eyes
I am reason, I am vice

It's there
From everywhere it sounds

[Scarecrow]
And you'll fall away from heaven
Once you know you can't take no more of it
You will fall away from heaven
By the time you can see the crime against you

And you'll fall away from heaven
Once you know you can't take no more of it
You will fall away from heaven
By the time you can see the crime against you

And you'll fall away from heaven
Once you know you can't take no more of it
You will fall away from heaven
By the time you can see the crime against you

8. Forever Is A Long Time
[Mephistopheles]
Young is the day
Still it's the same
The same old tomorrow
Colors too bright
So dream in black and white
If you wanna rise from the hollow

The future in sight
The past in your head
Nightmare or treason
The father above you as you
Walk through the ashes
Don't you run out of reason

You keep on waiting
For your choice to be made
There ain't no bounty
For the number of passions
You rein in for love

You are defying the devil
Forever this time
But you can't imagine
Forever will drag on a long long time
You are defying salvation
The wait is your crime
Stalemate in virtue, we falter
Forever's a long time

[Scarecrow]
Pleasure and pain feel all the same
To the dreamer who's trying to get closer
Strange how it feels in reality
When your fairy tale's over

No right or wrong
I just keep going on
And I don't get lost in belief

Falter and pray
Keep looking away
I don't wanna see

We keep on waiting
For a choice to be made
There ain't no bounty for the passion
We rein in for love

[Mephistopheles]
You are defying the devil
Forever this time
But you can't imagine
Forever will drag on a long long time
You are defying salvation
The wait is your crime
Stalemate in virtue, we falter
Forever's a long time
Forever is a long time
It's gonna take forever

Oh - young is the day
Still it's the same
The same old tomorrow
Colors too bright
So dream in black and white
Wanna rise from the hollow
You are defying the devil
Forever this time
But you can't imagine
Forever will drag on a long long time
You are defying salvation
The wait is your crime
Stalemate in virtue, we falter
Forever's a long time

9. Black Wings
[Shelter]
I've been here through a million ages
I am the savior inside
Tonight I am love and justice
Tomorrow perversion to spite

And now that it's bleeding you dry
I'm calling you, I'm calling you
When temperance is bleeding you dry
I'm knocking you off the perch

[Scarecrow]
And out in the rain
I'll hide under wings I'd curse in sunlight
Out in the rain
You can break me and take me away
On wings of fury

[Shelter]
Live your tragic comedy
I'm the poison in your veins
Circumspection, vanity
You give all they can take

I am fury, I am fire, I'm the worm inside
Deliver you from self-denial tonight
When temperance is bleeding you dry, I'm inside

[Scarecrow]
And out in the rain

I'll hide under wings I'd curse in sunlight
Out in the rain
You can break me and take me away
On wings of fury

[Shelter]
Who do you think you are
To tell me what to say
Who do you think you are
To tell me what to play
What not to break
When temperance is bleeding you dry, I'm inside

[Scarecrow]
And out in the rain
I'll hide under wings I'd curse in sunlight
Out in the rain
You can break me and take me away
On wings of fury

10. States Of Matter
[Inspiration]
Your mind to infinity
Let reason rivet on your feet or you may fall
You're drawn into a distant glow
You dream of voices from on high
But can't evade another rainy night
And putting on another show
Hate and affection
Pleasure and pain
Modes of vibration
Unveiling to be all the same

And when the final day has come
It's another state of matter
And when you face another sun
It's the union of the states of matter

[Scarecrow]
Failure and defeat and all the riches surely beat
Where I have been and what I have been before
And when the sands of time run low
Commemoration of a lonely crow
That would have made it through the door

Light and affection
Darkness and pain
Mind over matter
The all's gonna make it all the same

And when the final day has come
It's another state of matter
When you will face another sun
It's the union of the states of matter

[Inspiration]
Light and affection
Darkness and pain
Mind over matter
The all's gonna make it all the same

And when the final day has come
It's another state of matter
When you will face another sun
It's the union of the states of matter

11. The Edge
[Scarecrow]
When I was sent to walk this long cold way
I'd never meant to take it all this far
Nobody told me I was bound to stray
You gave me visions and cut out this part

When the journey is over
Then what will remain
But a churchyard of angels

Don't need no glory
The bottle and I
Don't need no sympathy at all
As I hang on the edge

Don't need no glory
Till the river's run dry
I won't cry for sympathy as I
Hang on the edge

When your were shackles chances passed me by
I've broken free
Now I'm free falling
Laid down my arms as you laid down the lie:
Those words you didn't say when I was calling

Fingers bleed onto the ivory
They dance on the keys
To a churchyard of angels

Don't need no glory
The bottle and I
Don't need no sympathy at all
As I hang on the edge

Don't need no glory
Till the river's run dry
I won't cry for sympathy as I
Hang on the edge

Don't need no glory
The bottle and I
Don't need your sympathy at all
As I hang on the edge

Don't need no glory
Till the river's run dry
I won't cry for sympathy as I
Hang on the edge

Don't need no glory
The bottle and I
I don't need your sympathy at all
As I hang on the edge

Don't need no glory
The bottle and I
I don't need your sympathy at all
As I hang on the edge

1. Mystery Of A Blood Red Rose
[Lead vocals: Tobias]
[Lead guitar: Sascha Paeth]

We've played our roles in our passion plays
They've imposed on us right from the cradle
No matter what you dream, beware of what you say
Until the cogwheel's out of control to burst out of place

No time to breathe, don't have no time to waste
Bring on the night, seize every drop of life away

Slice a tasty hour off from (or in a blink it will be gone)
A stranding future bring it on

Mystery of a blood-red rose
Burning like a raging fire
When the day's been torn apart we'll leave it behind
Mystery of a blood-red rose
Feasting on a blind desire
Let the scent of poisonous flowers tempt me away

A sweet temptation and a pure red rose
While the hour don't wait for a blink to cram the past
I'll get a move on
No hesitation makes no one a better man
I can't wait to finally know now what is gonna show now in

Mystery of a blood-red rose
Burning like a raging fire
When the day's been torn apart we'll leave it behind
Mystery of a blood-red rose
Future glowing on a pyre
Let the scent of a poisonous rose tempt me away

Boy, reach out for what is due
Or you'll lap up what's left for you
Throw ourselves into the waves
And as the grinding wheel of time
Is grinding out the chimes
To echo in the night

We're off into the moonshine

Mystery of a blood-red rose
Burning like a raging fire
When the day's been torn apart we'll leave it behind
Mystery of a blood-red rose
Future glowing on a pyre
Let the scent of a poisonous rose tempt me away

And I will waste no time tonight
And I don't waste no time at all tonight

2. Let The Storm Descend Upon You
[Lead vocals: Tobias, Jorn Lande, Ronnie Atkins, Robert Mason (Warrant)]
[Lead guitar: Oliver Hartmann]

I'm smothered by your lucid nothing
I can't hear and touch and see
But I feel it
Though I can't believe it
Like master of the observation
Coming up with an explanation
There's no need
Making use of the spirit

We can give you answers you are dying to receive
Keep on dreaming
Keep on screaming
yeah
You might be getting too much for your beating hart to take
Your flesh is malice
Prepare your chalice

Lights
breathe and sleep tight
Will you defy intriguing ghostlights
Seeing through all lies and foolish warnings

There ain't no return

Never like the darkness
It may burn your soul away
As you've been seeing
What you've though you're dreaming

Never open doors if you don't dare to walk on through
Maybe you're old
Now it's all your fault

Light
You're off to the light
Will you defy all evil ghostlights
Tell the truth from depuration
Time
Don't waste no time
Prevail against the hands that tick your flesh away
Now delve into your own reflection

Oh, in all that where I've been to
There's nothing but a void over the sanity of fools

Shine your light into the darkness
And let the storm descend upon you
And I will make you mine
Shine your light into the darkness
Behold the lead Aurora fall upon you
Oh, let the storm descend upon you

Journey to the other side
It's just a trip and pleasure ride
And I don't know
But does it really matter?

I am he who's always been
Who dares to know what can't be seen
I'm illusion or truth
I'm confusion

Light
Bring me the light
I will bring out certainty on a silver plate
Like a mantle piece
I will wipe out darkness

Night,
Blessed is the night
'Til there's no time left to spill
To save and kill
To take and seize
'Til this trip's your law

Obey reflections of some crazy dream
Or maybe the backside of reality

Shine your light into the darkness
And let the storm descend upon you
And I will make you mine
Shine your light into the darkness
Behold the lead Aurora fall upon you
Let the storm descend upon you

You gotta pray you're gunning just a ghostlight
You gotta be won't be falling down the wayside
Let it carry you away

Cut the gem until it's purified away
The candle burning to the ground
I don't see nothing but addiction to the rhyme
Kindles everything around

For all the world we'll see it tower to the stars
And all is melting into one

We give them something to fall back on every time
They're too strung out to run

Every moment, every heartbeat, every breath
Leaves you one less to your last

Still you cherish every second of the game
Give me the future, you take the past

And what if God is just an image in the mind
A reflection of the will

And what's the valor when the law you live in harmony
Falls second for the drill

I pray the lord ain't just a ghostlight in my mind
a reflection of the will
Let the storm descend upon me
Let Aurora fall upon me

Let the fire fall upon him
Let the fire purify him
Never judge a thing you see
It's only what your mortal eyes will want it to be
Oh, bring it on
Let the dark and heaven confusion
Spit out a conclusion

Obey reflections of a memory
Are just reflections in a crazy dream

Shine your light into the darkness
And let the storm descend upon you
And I will make you mine
Shine your light into the darkness
Behold the lead Aurora fall upon you
Shine your light into the darkness (through the darkness)
And let the storm descend upon you

And I will make you mine
Shine your light into the darkness (into the darkness)
Behold the lead Aurora fall upon you
Oh, let the storm descend upon you (let the storm descend upon you)
Oh, descend upon you, yeah

3. The Haunting
[Lead vocals: Dee Snider, Tobias]
[Lead guitar: Sascha Paeth]

I can't count the days I've days I've roamed
A stray ghost liked to wither on the vine
A paling tales of days long gone
I won't be until you close your eyes

Sleep time
Someone's always by your side

A thousand nights we've been calling your name
Close your eyes but I won't go away
We're there for you
The cold embrace that you don't wanna feel
Must not be but you know it is real
We're there for you

Don't you waste your time and try
To understand this figment of the lie

Don't breathe the word to anyone
By the time you phrase me I'll be gone

Sweet dreams
See you in the twilight zone

A thousand nights we've been calling your name
Close your eyes but I won't go away
We're there for you
The cold embrace that you don't wanna feel
Must not be but you know it is real
We're there for you

Down I must contain the wayward fantasy
Where did all those wicked dreams come from
Pictures in the dark they seem so eerily
Winter night, I pray my mind is wrong

I'm the spot they refuse to conceive

A thousand nights we've been calling your name
Close your eyes but I won't go away
We're there for you
The cold embrace that you don't wanna feel
Must not be but you know it is real
We're there for you

4. Seduction Of Decay
[Lead vocals: Geoff Tate, Tobias]
[Lead guitar: Sascha Paeth]

It ain't the far cry that it seemed
In just a wink we'd come for you
You may not feel it
We are the light, the scorching heat
We are the untold chosen few
And now we've come for you

We'll fit you like a velvet glove that's gonna choke their minds
Affiliate yourself with what you can't defy
Some below and few above
We're gonna numb their minds

Riot on the edge
On the brink of insanity
Riot on the edge

You'll hear me screaming your name
I am the angel of decay to seize you
There'll be no thoughts to maintain
I am the seduction of decay

I hear their tales reverberate
From shrouds of myth that only time would weave
Bred in a den of lunacy
Who can we trust? Who's next in line?
The sacred drive to rationalize
Commit ourselves another day to the lesser crime
Choke on your own pace with candour
So pleasant in the quiet
Vicegerents of the tide

Riot on the edge
On the brink of insanity
Riot on the edge

You'll hear me screaming your name
I am the angel of decay to seize you
There'll be no thoughts to maintain
I'm the seduction of decay

Time contaminating space to reinfect and agonize anything around
We are metabolite of dreams
The chosen ones to sacrifice the wasteland-bound

Oh, Euphoria is looming in the darkness
Coincidence of opposites we are
Once beautiful intentions

Oh, we'll drag you over
Oh, it's gonna drag you over

Oh, from the start we run away
And don't seem to care what for
Forever feels just like a blink after passing by
Just fools don't know the prime's another state of decay

Riot on the edge
On the brink of insanity
Riot on the edge

You'll hear me screaming your name
I am the angel of decay to seize you
There'll be no thoughts to maintain
I'm the seduction of decay

5. Ghostlights
[Music & Lyrics: Tobias Sammet]
[Lead vocals: Michael Kiske, Tobias, Jorn Lande]
[Lead guitar: Sascha Paeth, Oliver Hartmann]

[Mystic:]
You're tossing and turning
You think you're awake while you're trying to run
Like in a nightmare
Time loves your ego to death
You're leaving the wheelwork to the ground of being
You go on
Defying temptation in the engine room that is ourselves

[Aaron:]
I feel a storm is looming with a shaking grumble
I don't know if I'm right or wrong
I don't know if I shall go on
I don't know what I'll believe but I'm on my way

[Mystic:]
Minds fly free when the gates fly open
Walk on through

[Aaron:]
Thunder and rain and the wind in my face

[Mystic:]
Ghostlights dance will you heed the token
Glazing light

[Aaron:]
Blinding my eyes get me out of this maze

The world as we know it is beginning to shake
I don't trust my eyes are we all superstitious
If we think what our hearts know is true
Fireworks surround me
Wherever I go they tell me: always home
Psycho-somatic they'll name it the nature of god

[Mystic:]
Off to a new horizon
Time is the key to unite with the all
Time is gonna make you see right from wrong eternally
Don't let the noises devour you

[Mystic:]
Minds fly free when the gates fly open
Walk on through

[Aaron:]
Thunder and rain and the wind in my face

[Mystic:]
Ghostlights dance will you heed the token
Glazing light

[Aaron:]
Blinding my eyes get me out of this maze

[Solo: Sascha Paeth & Oliver Haartmann]

[Temptation:]
And what if you're only a prism for the ghostlights that you wanna see
And we're just reflections of your dreams

[Aaron:]
It's speaking to me
It's yelling at me
It's screaming to me, resonating with me
And a thousand lights are trying to make me see
They call me home

[Mystic:]
Minds fly free when the gates fly open
Walk on through

[Aaron:]
Thunder and rain and the wind in my face

[Mystic:]
Ghostlights dance will you heed the token
Glazing light

[Aaron:]
Blinding my eyes get me out of this maze

6. Draconian Love
[Lead vocals: Herbie Langhans (Sinbreed), Tobias]
[Lead guitar: Sascha Paeth]

[2x]
You shed draconian love
You shed draconian...

Welcome to your way
Seemingly endless as you take your wings
The world through kaleidoscope eyes
Until you unlearn what you keep inside

Those innocent eyes...
Refracting the light for an innocent soul
Till the cold around's not gonna wait its turn
Wait its turn no more

[Pre-chorus:]
Tell me how should I embrace?
Like roses we'll wither on the vine
Why should I bide my time
If it flies away sometime?

[Chorus:]
Where are you now, where are you now?
Leaving me down here lost in the waves
Hey, hey, hey
When will God explain this draconian love?
You shed draconian love, you shed draconian love
Where do I go? Where are you now?
Selling me love through the fiery rain, angel
When will you explain this draconian love?
It's all draconian love, it's all draconian

Infiltrate us with mercy
Bait us with sympathy
Blind us with love
We're lost in the clouds rolling by
What some of us read into what they feel

Like a grain of nothing
I feel cast in the wind of enthean caprice
Of an unbred cause,
Of an unborn will
Whatever that may mean

[Pre-chorus:]
Tell me how should I embrace?
Like roses we'll wither on the vine
Tell me why should I bide my time?
If it flies away sometime

[Chorus:]
Where are you now, where are you now?
Leaving me down here lost in the waves
Hey, hey, hey
When will God explain this draconian love?
You shed draconian love, you shed draconian love
Where do I go? Where are you now?
Selling me love through fiery rain, angel
When will you explain this draconian love?
It's all draconian love, it's all draconian

Aspiration and tears,
Heartache and fears
Draconian love, you shed draconian love
Unrequited love – down on my knees
Draconian love, it's all draconian

Where are you now, where are you now?
Leaving me down here lost in the waves
Will you explain this draconian love?

[Chorus:]
Where are you now, where are you now?
Leaving me down here lost in the waves
Hey, hey, hey
When will God explain this draconian love?
You shed draconian love, you shed draconian love
Where do I go? Where are you now?
Selling me love through fiery rain
Hey, hey, hey
Will you explain this draconian love?
It's all draconian love, it's all draconian

Where are you now, where are you now?
Leaving me down here lost in the waves
When will God explain this draconian love?
You she draconian love, you shed draconian love
Where do I go? Where are you now?
Selling me love through fiery rain...

7. Master Of The Pendulum
[Lead vocals: Marco Hietala, Tobias]
[Lead guitar: Sascha Paeth]

[Aaron:]
Who's the one who's stretching out his hand
Is it it or is it me that won't lose hold
Take on to the pendulum and sway
Like a mistletoe I'm clinging to the cold, yeah

[Watchmaker:]
I am the trellis for those in need to twine around
The rock of ages for those who're meant to wander around
I got no time for a break and we got no time to waste
I'll save it up in the pace, I'll quantify thoughts away
That you don't need anyway, oh what a beautiful day...

[Aaron:]
Tic toc tic toc
Someone's watching over me

[Watchmaker:]
Begging for a dance
While your sands are running out
Rigid and firm's what I hold in my hands
Tick away time, I allot and I divide
Master of the hands that guide you
Run if you can while the war drum's ticking on
Ancient of days, I'm the shouldering pace
I will make you mine, I allot and I divide
Master of the hands that push you

That's who I am.
The master of these hands

I lead the horse to the water and I make it drink
I'm here to force precision just on everything

[Aaron:]
I feel your breath in my neck
I feel you behind my back
And as I'm turning around
There's just this frightening sound
I feel it everywhere
Oh I know that you're there...

Tic toc tic toc
Someone's watching over me

Begging for a dance while your sands are running out
Rigid and firm's what you hold in your hands
Tick away time, you allot and you divide
Master of the hands that guide you

Run if you can while the war drum's ticking on
Ancient of days: you're the shouldering pace

[Watchmaker:]
I will make you mine, I allot and I divide
Master of the hands that push you

[Aaron:]
Angels fall
Time's gonna winnow all
Dying dreams
Right from wrong
Dwell in a run
Turn the wheel
Something's reaching out for me

[Watchmaker:]
Begging for a dance
While your sands are running out
Rigid and firm's what I hold in my hands
Tick away time, I allot and I divide
Master of the hands that guide you

Run if you can while the war drum's ticking on
Ancient of days, I'm the shouldering pace
I will make you mine, I allot and I divide
Master of the hands that push you

8. Isle Of Evermore
[Lead vocals: Sharon Den Adel, Tobias]

[Muse:]
From a frozen world will you take me over
All alone, sweet embrace
Leave the place I can't abide no more

[Aaron:]
Take a look at ourselves, afraid to get closer
Will the predetermination drive us to a distant shore

[Muse:]
The tender velvet gown of destination left behind

[Both:]
I'm wide awake, I'm on my way to evermore
[Muse:]
And I turn around to fading shores
I'll sail on through this opening door
[Both:]
Wide awake onto the isle of evermore
[Muse:]
I'm dead to the world, you blindfold my eyes
While you're killing what I'm yearning for

[Muse:]
You just see what your eyes have been told to tell you
Falling down to the ground, how come you ask if what you feel is true

[Aaron:]
I'm staring at the maze and let it paralyze me
Watch it come alive and burn me out until I'm coming through
The tender velvet gown of slumber will just leave me just breathing

[Both:]
Wide awake I'm on my way to evermore
[Muse:]
And I turn around to fading shores
I'll sail on through this opening door
[Both:]
Wide awake onto the isle of evermore
I'm dead to the world
You blindfold my eyes
[Muse:]
While you're killing what I'm yearning for
What I'm yearning for...

[Both:]
Wide awake I'm on my way to evermore
[Aaron:]
And I turn around to fading shores
[Both:]
I'll sail on through this opening door
Wide awake onto the isle of evermore
I'm dead to the world blindfold my eyes
While you're killing what I'm yearning for

9. Babylon Vampyres
[Lead vocals: Tobias, Robert Mason (Warrant)]
[Lead guitar: Bruce Kulick, Oliver Hartmann, Sascha Paeth]

[Aaron:]
A lot of good advice
Nobody's keeping for themselves
If you're playing by the rules
You'll be a trophy on a shelf
Give in to the ordinary run of things
Like it is meant to be
There's nothing left of me

[Scientist I:]
Praying for salvation, floating with the tide
The very first temptation
Drags you to the other side
You learn to walk and run
You fly until you fall as far as I can see

[Aaron:]
The future ahead was not what it used to be

[Scientist I:]
Blessed was the darkness - veiling hypocrisy

[Scientist I:]
Babylon is burning, shining from afar
Babylon is burning

[Aaron:]
From sunset to sunrise

[Scientist I:]
Babylon is burning
And you're glowing like a fiery star
And no one can tell if we've been for real

Babylon is burning
Babylon is burning

They say it's coming by the night
To engraft into the brain
What a scientific tongue won't recall
Or even phrase
It's crawling up your spine
To breed a wicked freak of nature
We will be a new society

[Aaron:]
Headless congregation, a vortex needing more

[Scientist I:]
The road to good intentions is evil to the core

[Aaron:]
The devil and the deep blue sea are waiting
Side by side for me

[Aaron:]
The sweet scent of poison
Hazing the dread away
This side of the moon I'll confess to... another day

[Scientist I:]
Babylon is burning, shining from afar

[Aaron:]
Babylon is burning
From sunset to sunrise

[Scientist I:]
Babylon is burning
And you're glowing like a fiery star
And no one can tell if we've been for real
Yeah

[Scientist I:]
Ever since I can remember
I've been shooting up that road with a dream
I saw gold at the end of the rainbow
I was given an idea of what life should be
What life should be

[Aaron:]
Ain't there a light above the shadow
Ain't there blood in the machine
Ain't there flesh they'd been misleading
Ain't there a longing soul within?

[Scientist I:]
I've seen believers on the wayside
And I'm afraid to say, I think just like you
That failed to pretend
They could cope with what they'd find
When they didn't have a clue - just like you
Babylon is burning, shining from afar

[Aaron:]
Babylon is burning
From sunset to sunrise

[Scientist I:]
Babylon is burning
And you're glowing like a fiery star
And no one can tell if we've been for real, oh
Babylon is burning, shining from afar

[Aaron:]
Babylon is burning
From sunset to sunrise

[Scientist I:]
Babylon is burning
And you're glowing like a fiery star
And no one can tell if we've been for real

10. Lucifer
[Lead vocals: Jorn Lande, Tobias]
[Lead guitar: Bruce Kulick]

Eternities ago I must have fallen
Through my pride been perfect in my ways
The Morning star they fired down from heaven
Envy wrapped into a gown of grace

I hear the screams that echo from the darkness
I swerve from dawn to dusk and off the edge
Oh hear the creature crying in the distance
Buried in the symbol on a shelf

I'll take you home tonight to center of your soul
I'll take you home tonight. Fire, flesh and blood
Touching the flames tonight,
Touching the flames tonight

Morning star, embrace me on this grounds, angel of light

[Guitar solo]

How will I forgive him who wouldn't forgive me who just value the power?
How should I live in peace with the one, outshining me and then have me devoured?

I'm feeling alive under the skies.
Blood-shot's the moon and scarlet's the night
I'll make you fume in fury and rage.
I'll make you see what you're made of tonight

I'll take you home tonight to center of your soul
I'll take you home tonight. Fire, flesh and blood
Touching the flames tonight,
Touching the flames tonight
Touching the flames tonight,
Touching the flames tonight

11. Unchain The Light
[Lead vocals: Tobias, Ronnie Atkins, Michael Kiske]
[Lead guitar: Sascha Paeth, Oliver Hartmann]

[Aaron:]
Who's got the answer
Is this what I'm looking for
And who do I talk to
What do I have to explore

[Magician:]
Attend to your god given duty
You'll be taking your heaven by force
How could you choose
With your head in the noose
With no time to lose

[Mystic:]
High up in the open skies

[Magician:]
We'll chain the light
We'll take the time from those it does to death, we're

[Mystic:]
High up in the open skies

[Aaron:]
We'll chain the light
We'll take the time from those it does to death and I'll chain the light
I'll bring it right down to illuminate unholy ways, we'll chain the light

[Magician:]
Too worn out to wonder
We might not want to overextend them no more
Our beautiful spook lights are all they will need
All they will want to explore

[Aaron:]
And after it's all said and done
We won't fear the transience no more
'Cause we don't realize
Idle glance in our eyes
Let precision prevail

[Mystic:]
High up in the open skies

[Magician:]
We'll chain the light
We'll take the time from those it does to death,
We're

[Mystic:]
High up in the open skies

[Aaron:]
We'll chain the light
We'll take the time from those it does to death and I'll chain the light
I'll bring it right down to illuminate unholy way, we'll chain the light

[Mystic:]
You look above
To see inside yourself
And find time standing still
You see the world in different light
You turn this moment
Into what you think it's ought to be
Demystify the dark

[Mystic:]
High up in the open skies

[Magician:]
We'll chain the light
We'll take the time from those it does to death,
We're

[Mystic:]
High up in the open skies

[Aaron:]
We'll chain the light
We'll take the time from those it does to death and I'll chain the light
I'll bring it right down to illuminate unholy ways

12. A Restless Heart And Obsidian Skies
[Lead vocals: Bob Catley, Tobias]
[Lead guitar: Bruce Kulick]

[Spirit:]
A genuine soul to dwell on baleful grounds
Glances wandering around
In the darkness of the world
Clouds have closed a ring around the sky
While the old ones hear the chimes
Through the darkness of the world

A genuine man will realize
He must fawn upon the times
While he shouldn't waste a word
Tender feet on stony ground
See the young ones stray around
Through the darkness of the world

[Aaron:]
Sacred heart will you usher me now
For I'll carry the lantern your way
For I'll bring us home

[Spirit:]
Dark is the night, scarlet the moon
Sacred the light in the haze reflecting within

[Aaron:]
Blazing the trail

Be still my restless heart
Obsidian's the sky
Inward you look as you halt

[Spirit:]
Be still restless heart

[Aaron:]
I'm on my way

[Spirit:]
Under obsidian skies

[Aaron:]
Wake to the sound of passing time
How could I quantify it in the darkness of the world
Wake to the shadow of a dream
Nothing's what it seems
As you brave the darkness of the world

[Spirit:]
Ghost lights and matter
You'll know what is real
Perception and fact - all the same
Truth's what you feel

[Spirit:]
Dark is the night, scarlet the moon
Sacred the light in the haze reflecting within

[Aaron:]
Blazing the trail

Be still my restless heart
Obsidian's the sky
Inward you look as you halt

[Spirit:]
Be still restless heart

[Aaron:]
I'm on my way
Under obsidian skies

[Spirit:]
And the wind and the rain that were shaking the pane
Move onward along with the clouds
And you're gazing in awe at the ghost lights above
As if stars cut their way through the shroud
On and on and on...

[Spirit:]
Moon shines
Ghost lights
Oh they reach out for you
Blazing the trail under obsidian skies

[Aaron:]
Dark is the night, scarlet the moon
Sacred the light in the haze reflecting within
Blazing the trail

Be still my restless heart

[Spirit:]
Obsidian's the sky
Inward you look as you halt
Be still restless heart

[Aaron:] I'm on my way

[Aaron:]
Dark is the night, scarlet the moon
Sacred the light in the haze reflecting within
Blazing the trail
Be still my restless heart

[Spirit:]
Obsidian's the sky
Inward you look as you halt
Be still restless heart

[Aaron:] I'm on my way

13. Wake Up To The Moon
You see the sun touch the horizon
You know the future awaits
And yours hides in the darkness

The stars are gonna line up in the night sky
I see what some will deny
As I follow the starkness

Can you believe your eyes
We'll make you rise to the occasion
Follow your heart and run
Seek shelter from the day

Waiting for the moon
The sound of falling angels calling you
Strange and magic
Hear us call your name

Darkness shines a sweet
deceleration down on you

Wayward child wake up to the moon

They wanna squeeze you in their picture from the outside
they call your life a world of make-believe

You're feeling pushed by a racing heartbeat
Parameterizing the world
They only see what they're told to see

Child of the ocean floor
No need of daylight that deceives you
Don't let them wear you down
Listen to the voice

Waiting for the moon
The sound of falling angels calling you

Strange and magic
Hear us call your name

Darkness shines a sweet
deceleration down on you
Wayward child wake up to the moon

Kind of buried alive
You've been sacrificed
They show you the key
Till you love to agree
A brave modern day
This world is insane

Waiting for the moon
The sound of falling angels calling you
Strange and magic

Hear us call your name
Darkness shines a sweet
deceleration down on you
Wayward child wake up to the moon
Waiting for the moon
The sound of falling angels calling you
Strange and magic
Hear us call your name
Darkness shines a sweet
deceleration down on you
Wayward child wake up to the moon
