The kingdom lies in shadows, now the sun is burning grey
will we even live to see tomorrow?
The echoes of the battlefield still ringing in our cars
Now our future dark and stained with tears of sorrow

The Knights who went before us calling in the wind.
Sill our hearts with honour, now our journey must begin
Together we are standing tall, together we will be forever
Side by side for all eternity

Wings of forever we soar in the sky
United in battle in glory we die
Wings of forever our journey goes on
And we all raise our to the stars far beyond

We cross the distant mountains, riding on through wind and rain
Beneath us in the valley lie the warriors so brave
A place for them is grand by the wisdom of the kings
And we'll join them when they toll the judgement bell

The Knights who went before us calling in the wind
Sill our hearts with honour, now our journey must begin
Together we are standing tall, together we will be forever
Side by side for all eternity

Wings of forever we soar in the sky
United in battle in glory we die
Wings of forever our journey goes on
And we all raise our to the stars far beyond

[Solo (Totman) / Solo (Bickers)]

The Knights who went before us calling in the wind

Side by side for all eternity

Wings of forever we soar in the sky
United in battle in glory we die
Wings of forever our journey goes on
And we all raise our eyes to the stars far beyond
Wings of forever we soar in the sky
United in battle in glory we die
Wings of forever our journey goes on
And our wings all raise to the stars far beyond

3. Far Away
[Words and Music - Williams]

Legend tells a secret, buried deep in time
A may to free our people, to free them from these crimes
Lost beneath fountain, across the distant sea
We'll journey there together in search of liberty

We board the ship together and sail into the night
No land to see before us, we follow stars so bright
Then the land is sighted, our journey almost done
We leave the ship unguarded, the legend drivers us on

Through wind and rain we travel, onwards 'cross the land
Guided by the starlight, towards the eastern sands

Far away in a bygone age
When the stories all were true
Legends told by the men of old
Have brought us here today

The fountain stands before us, our mission is complete
We search beneath the water, a sword lies our feet
The sword will bring us glory, our freedom is assured
We will return to save our land from suffering endured

Through wind and rain we travel, onwards 'cross the land
Guided by the starlight, towards the eastern sands

Far away in a bygone age
When the stories all were true
Legends told by the men of old
Have brought us here today

[Solo (Bickers) / Solo (Williams) / Solo (Totman)]

Through wind and rain we travel, onwards 'cross the land
Guided by the starlight, towards the eastern sands

Far away in a bygone age
When the stories all were true
Legends told by the men of old
Have brought us here today

4. Glory Tonight
[Words and Music - Williams]

An echo on the wind tells a distant warning
Time has come for us to make the journey home
We followed all our lives tales of beasts and valour
And heroes who have walked this road before

If there was another way
If the light can pierce the dark
It seems there's nowhere left to turn
We stand up as one now that our time has come.

Twilight surrounds us the night closes in
Darkness has fallen we stand for our King
An empire in shadows the candle burns low
We'll all find some glory tonight

The chaos in our minds tells a different story
If the light can pierce the dark
Now world will see... see what we are made of
And how we'll conquer all to save the crown

Twilight surrounds us the night closes in
Darkness has fallen we stand for our King
An empire in shadows the candle burns low
We'll all find some glory tonight

[Solo (Bickers) / Solo (Williams) / Solo (Bickers) / Solo (Totman)]

If there was another way
If the light can pierce the dark
It seems there's nowhere left to turn
We stand up as one now that our time has come.

We'll all find some glory....... tonight.

5. Power Quest (Part 1)
[Words and Music - Williams]

[Solo (Martongelli)]

A feeling deep within
A memory of how we used to be
I see it in your eyes
And I know you feel the same way too

The seeds of doubt were sown
When confidence has been betrayed
What am I doing here ?
But do you feel the same way too ?

The signs were there but we decided not to look
A premonition of the last page of the book
When we get down to it there's no-one else to blame
Questions may change but the answer's the same

How will I know what I'm searching for
Living my life uncertain
Who will reveal what's behind the door ?
Or must the quest continue

An opportunity
A chance to make amends for what went wrong
Another twist of fate
Conspires to leave me here alone once more

The signs were there but we decided not to look
A premonition of the last page of the book
When we get down to it there's no-one else blame
Questions may change but the answers' the same

How will I know what I'm searching for
Living my life uncertain
Who will reveal what's behind the door ?
Or must the quest continue

How will I know what I'm searching for
Living my life uncertain
Who will reveal what's behind the door ?
Or must the quest continue

[Solo (Williams) / Solo (Bickers) / Solo (Totman) / Solo (Martongelli)]

My spirit will never be broken
The quest will go on to the end
This time is forever
The promise we held deep inside

Thought rivers and mountains between us
Together as one we will be
I'll never stop searching
To find you my friend once again

How will I know what I'm searching for
Living my life uncertain
Who will reveal what's behind the door ?
Or must the quest continue

How will I know what I'm searching for
Living my life uncertain
Who will reveal what's behind the door ?
Or must the quest continue

6. Beyond The Stars
[Music - Totman / Words - Williams, Totman]

Walking through shadows down the night of memory lane
Think of the past I'm reminded once again
A place where the people had gathered as one
Their spirit provided a haven for all

Darkness may cover the land far away
Visions uncover the past once again
My soul feels the echo of yesterdays dream
And our purpose discovered at last.

Reach for the stars that shine bright in the sky
Reach up to heaven you'll hear angels cry
On the road we must follow the dark lord will come
And for ever the quest must go on

The ancient village is destroyed, the people all are gone
Bodies are buried and marked with a stone
The voice of our father still rides on the wind
Brings hope for the ones that are still yet to come

Darkness may cover the land far away
Visions uncover the past once again
My soul feels the echo of yesterdays dream
And our purpose discovered at last.

Reach for the stars that shine bright in the sky
Reach up to heaven you'll hear angels cry
On the road we must follow the dark lord will come
and for ever the quest must go on.

[Solo (Williams) / Solo (Totman) / Solo (Bickers)]

Black Knights together demons they send
We fight the evil on to the end
On the march for ever after, standing by the King forever
Bound to live for now and evermore

Reach for the stars that shine bright in the sky
Reach up to heaven with glory we die

Reach for the stars that shine bright in the sky
Reach up to heaven you'll hear angels cry
On the road we must follow the dark lord will come
And for ever the quest must go on.
And for ever the quest must go on.

7. Immortal Plains
[Words and Music - Williams]

What about everything that happened long ago
What about plans we made together
What about comrades stood beside us way back when
It seemed times would last forever

With sword in hand we will make a stand
Eternity would not see us divided
In the darkest night though there was no light
We see the way before us clear as day

If we live or we die, it will not be goodbye
If we stumble and fall, there's no end to it all
If we fight with our hearts, none can tear us apart
Through the wind and the rain we'll meet again
On immortal plains.

What about all the things that still are yet to come
What about all the things we dreamed of
Can we be certain now just what lies far beyond
Can we feel safe without the answers.

With sword in hand we would make a stand
Eternity would not see us divided
In the darkest night though there was no light
We see the way before us clear as day

[Ch.] If we live or we die, it will not be goodbye
If we stumble and fall, there's no end to it all
If we fight with our hearts, none can tear us apart
Though the wind and the rain we'll meet again
On immortal plains

[Solo (Totman)]

8. Follow Your Heart
[Words and Music - Williams]

I dream of strange illusions and the legacy of old
But can I really trust the visions that I see ?
Take me to the temple, I desire to see the truth
And to discover what the future holds for me

The chance you've got may never come to you again
You need some courage now to make a choice my friend
The sands of time dissolve with every breath you take
each step a little closer to the edge

Follow your heart and your dreams will come true
The path that you take and the journey you choose
The future unfolds as you head on your way
Everything possible, every day

I stand and wait in silence for the one who will arrive
To help me understand exactly what to do
Guiding me with wisdom that I'll need to stay alive
Is what I'll need if I'm to see the journey through

The chance you've got may never come to you again
You need some courage now to make a choice my friend
The sands of time dissolve with every breath you take
each step a little closer to the edge

Follow your heart and your dreams will come true
The path that you take and the journey you choose
The future unfolds as you head on your way
Everything possible, every day

[Solo (Adam) / Solo (Steve W) / Solo (Adam) / Solo (Sam)]

[P.] The chance you've got may never come to you again
You need some courage now to make a choice my friend
The sands of time dissolve with every breath you take
each step a little closer to the edge

[C.] Follow your heart and your dreams will come true
The path that you take and the journey you choose
The future unfolds as you head on your way
Everything possible, every day

Follow your heart and your dreams will come true
The path that you take and the journey you choose
The future unfolds as you head on your way
Everything possible, every day

9. Freedom Of Thought
[Words and Music - Adam Bickers]

[Verse 1.]
I look around and what do I see ?
Imprisoned minds in a sick society
I watch as the cycle goes on
Does no one else see that this is wrong ?
Spoon fed ignorant lies whilst imagination dies
Ready to accept (whatever offered next) without question or insight.

[Verse 2.]
I see, but I can't believe
My eyes grow black at this obscenity
Young lives compressed in the mould
Factory pre-set, dead before they're old.
Regurgitating filth, so typical of their ilk
Xenophobic breed, incredulous creed, deprived of all free will.

So fight - Defend your integrity
Be strong - Don't accept mediocrity
Preserve - The individual within
Believe - You never have to give in.

Freedom of thought is the virtue you need
To secure the future with hope and belief
Explore your ambitions and open your mind
There's no limit to what you can find

[Verse 3.]
It's time to make a stand
The future sits rooted in our hands
Break out of this cycle you are in
Uncharted paths is were true life begins.
No need to be alone, to make it on your own
We'll all be there to face the glare of uncertainty (and the) unknown.

So fight - Freedom of thought is the virtue you need
To secure the future with hope and belief
Explore your ambitions and open your mind
There's no limit to what you can find

Freedom of thought is the virtue you need
To secure the future with hope and belief
Explore your ambitions and open your mind
There's no limit to what you can find

[Solo (Totman) / (Bickers) / (Bikers)]

There's no limit to what you can find

Here we stand, the chosen ones together
Will the Quest go on forever; will we reach the Promised Land
We will find the gold beneath the rainbo
Oh can you still hear the echo in the caverns of your mind ?

Hear the call, leading us to freedo
Will you join us in the kingdom and forever fight or fal
Can it be, that fate is in our favou
We will be each other's saviour as we're tearing down the walls

So many battlefields, we've seen so many di
Carry me by starlight flying high above the sky

Neverworld, beyond the blue horizo
Neverworld, is where we long to b
Across the mountains and before the setting su
Neverworld,

Shadows fall, united true believer
Where the prophecy did lead us, we have reached the hallowed lan
Heart of steel, it will not rest foreve
We are all in this together as we wait the true command.

2. Temple of Fire
[WORDS - WILLIAMS, WALKER / MUSIC - WILLIAMS]

Seeing is believing so believe in what you see
feel the flame of desire burning deep in the fire
Can this be illusion or deluded fantasy ?
Can you see what is true, for me and for you ?

The people gathered all around us
Their voices raised aloud in honour
The spell forever will be broken
See a vision of the past

Day of Old - so the story goes
Travel far - everybody knows
Pilgrim come see your hearts desire
Before the Temple of Fire

I am not hero just an ordinary man
With the will to survive to be free and alive
Come and stand beside us, see the wonder of it all
In the light of the sun, in the shade of the moon

Can you find the answers in the visions that you see ?
Can you still remember what went wrong ?
Stand before the altar in the temple you have dreamt of for so long.

3. Edge of Time
[WORDS & MUSIC - WILLIAMS]

I told you once, told you a thousand times
It's not easy living this way
We chose a path, said it's the only one
The only path that will lead us away

(Find a way) you're not the only one
(Living a life) on a wing and prayer
(Turn around) face another day
You and I have nothing to lose

Stone cold, waiting for night to fall
Waiting for answers we need
Where will it end ? Heavenly requiem,
Can it be that only true hearts will bleed ?

Send a sign, we're standing on the edge of time
Heart divine, a future that once was mine
I can hardly recognize what's right before my eyes
Time dissolves into well below
Time dissolves into the well below

Light has gone, burning oblivion
Unholy silence invading my mind
What does this mean ? Where do we go from here ?
You and I will have to follow the blind.

4. Sacred Land
[WORDS & MUSIC - WILLIAMS]

Memories of childhood, a place so far away
Growing up together, it was where I thought we'd stay
Then one day soldiers came, told us of the wars
They told us we should join them and defend the holy cause

Adventures that would lead far across the land and sea
Sounded so amazing to an innocent like me
Made it seem so easy like nothing could go wrong
We thought we'd be away some time but never for so long

Joined together wrote our names upon the page
Seven times alliance our loyalty we gave
Sworn to be united not divided for the King
Who will ever know the honour that it brings ?

So farewell to the Sacred Land that we call forever home
Time will tell if we understand that we never walk alone
Side by side to the east we ride with our purpose clear and true
On we go, won't you join us too ?

Had no way of knowing if we ever would return
Would we see our loved ones or see more cities burn ?
Holy land will fall if we don't stand our ground
Jerusalem for evermore in darkness be adorned.

5. When I'm Gone
[WORDS & MUSIC - WILLIAMS]

I search the ruins of the world I call my own
In hopeless desperation now I make the journey home
I find that everything is not the way it was
You cannot fight the future; no you can't turn back the clock

The rain upon the mountains
The eagle in the sky
And the wolf and raven prowling all around
A broken cross will mark the holy ground

And when I'm gone, the world carries on
And you must carry on too
When I'm not around, time won't stand still
Your memories will always be true

You've got hold onto the dreams we once shared
Always be together even when I am not there
I'll be beside you every step of every day
Though you cannot see me, feel my presence on the way

6. For Evermore
[WORDS - WILLIAMS, NOLAN / MUSIC - WILLIAMS]

Time after time still not over
There is no ending in sight
Day after day the same old feelings
Surely all this isn't right

There will be sadness in these eyes forever
Lift my head towards the sky
And I know that this will happen more and more
As I watch the spirits drifting through the door of life

I can see angels in the sky
I can see demons down below
I can see everything that you will ever know
If I should live for evermore
And never see another dawn
You will see everything that I have seen before

Living my life am I really alive ?
No one should stay here long
How can it be will you tell me why ?
Talking the right from the wrong

I only hope the day will come
The day when I can close my eyes forever
A life oblivious to time
It feels like waiting for the end of never

Falling from grace the crosses I bear now
Carry them on to the end
Nowhere to turn not a soul even cares now
Only the memory of friends

You will see everything that I ... have seen ... before.

7. Well Of Souls
[WORDS - WILLIAMS / MUSIC - WILLIAMS, SCOTT]

Million voices call to me,
there's nowhere left to run
Souls cry out in torment,
pain and anguish has begun
Trapped for all eternity
no hope of breaking free
Calling out for vengeance,
now they're calling out to me

Will this be our true salvation ?
Can there be a brighter day ?
Will there be a new horizon ?
Will this be the price we pay ?

Chaos and damnation
For the victims of the well
Mortal life of agony,
immortal life of hell
A spell that can't be broken,
see the writing on the wall
Souls in black are silent;
wait to hear the judgement call

Deep inside the well of souls
where time is lost forever
Can you hear me call your name ?
Deep inside the well of souls a
thousand hearts are gathered
There must be someone to blame

8. Into The Light
[WORDS - WILLIAMS / MUSIC - SCOTT]

There was a time and place we would always go
We will meet there once again
Darkness had descended all around our home
Now we begin the journey there

Walk in the path of our fathers before
Wisdom and guidance will carry us through
Walk with the prophet who always did say
Spirits will lead us the rest of the way

Out of the darkness and into the light
Heaven beside us on this sacred night
Out of nightmare and into the dream
Returning together
The light always shines over me

Living isn't easy when you're far away from home
Seven years since we were there before
Many things have happened since we set eyes on you
Citadel in fallout from the war

City home is free again just like it was before
What will happen when we are gone ?
We hear the echoes of the time when we were young ?
Will we see darkness once again ?

9. Lost Without You
[WORDS & MUSIC - WILLIAMS]

It was a cold December morning
Round about midnight
Hear a distant church bell ring
Doesn't really mean a thing
Suddenly I catch your eye
And much to my surprise
You are looking back at me
I wonder just what you can see

Tonight is when you go away
I hope I'll see you soon someday
Candle flickers in the corner of my mind
It has been so many years
Filled with laughter, filled with tears
I just hope the memories linger on...

Can't you see I feel I'm fading away ?
And I don't know if I can face another day
Hearing voices at the back of my head
If this goes on I'm surely gonna end up dead
This was never how I thought it would be
How was I to know you would have this effect on me ?
Like a stranger in a far-away place
Day to day, hoping that it's not too late

Oh, can't you see, you're all I need

So I walk this road without you
Now that you have gone away
Heading for the future not the past
Spend my time without you
Live my own life everyday
How long is the heartache gonna last... oh

Now you're gone and only memories remain
Remind me of you and help to ease this tragic pain
That I'm feeling like I'm caught in a mire
Nowhere to turn, no one to quench the burning fire

I thought I heard you softly calling my name
Can't be true 'cause things will never be the same
Tried to reach you but there's no one at home
Feeling lonely even though I'm not on my own
Can't believe how quickly time has gone by
Days and weeks and months in the blink of an eye
Wish I knew how the story will end
There is one thing - I hope we can still be friends

10. Find The Way To The Top
[WORDS & MUSIC - Martongelli, Garavello]

I am walking in the street
And I'm shouting at this world of confusion
There is no way for me to turn back

Silence in the air seems to be an illusion
I only want to satisfy my soul

They tell me I am wrong but I don't mind their lies
And only with my pride I'll never die

Now I look for more
I look for more
And I wanna have some more so I will fly

I'm gonna find the way to the top
And fly to reach for the Land of the Sun
Where the fire burns and never, never stops
I'm gonna find the way to the top
You know I'll try 'cause I can't get enough
Want live, won't die, want run away, won't stop

I'm gonna find the way to the top
And fly to reach for the Land of the Sun
Where the fire burns and never, never stops
I'm gonna find the way to the top
You know I'll try 'cause I can't get enough
Want live, won't die, want run away, won't stop.

11. When I'm Gone
[lead vocal Sabine Edelsbacher]

[WORDS & MUSIC - WILLIAMS]

I search the ruins of the world I call my own
In hopeless desperation now I make the journey home
I find that everything is not the way it was
You cannot fight the future; no you can't turn back the clock

The rain upon the mountains
The eagle in the sky
And the wolf and raven prowling all around
A broken cross will mark the holy ground

And when I'm gone, the world carries on
And you must carry on too
When I'm not around, time won't stand still
Your memories will always be true

You've got hold onto the dreams we once shared
Always be together even when I am not there
I'll be beside you every step of every day
Though you cannot see me, feel my presence on the way

1. Cemetery Gates
I never walked a lonely road
When I was young
You were always there to guide me
And if I stand up should fall
Along the way
You would pick up all the pieces.

Always I prayed
Pray that the day would never, ever happen
But deep I knew.

And at the cemetery gates
I said goodbye
'Til we meet again in heaven
And as the curtain stars to fall
On all we had
Can I really live without you?

And now I turn and face the truth
I'm older now
With your spirit watching over me
I hope you're in a better place
I have no doubt
Sacred hearts, sacred memories.

Always I prayed
Pray that the day would never, ever happen
But deep I knew.

And at the cemetery gates
I said goodbye
'Til we meet again in heaven
And as the curtain stars to fall
On all we had
Can I really live without you?

Always I prayed
Pray that the day would never, ever happen
But deep I knew.

And at the cemetery gates
I said goodbye
'Til we meet again in heaven
And as the curtain stars to fall
On all we had
Can I really live without you?

And at the cemetery gates
I said goodbye
'Til we meet again in heaven
And as the curtain stars to fall
On all we had
Can I really live without you?

2. Human Machine
I'm trapped inside this life
The same thing every day
Too afraid to change
Is there another way?
I have no confidence
To try and break the chains
We only get one life
And only half remains.

Time slips away
Software corrupted, infected and afraid.

Human machine
Your life was programmed many years ago
Now it's time to set you free
Decode your dreams
Understand the truth that lies below
Shutdown... Reformat... Believe!

Another chance to change
Another exit gone
I didn't have the faith
How could I be so wrong?
Forever unaware
How quickly time goes by
Maybe it's not too late
I still control my fate

Time slips away
Hardware corrupted, infected and afraid.

Human machine
Your life was programmed many years ago
Now it's time to set you free
Decode your dreams
Understand the truth that lies below
Shutdown... Reformat... Believe!

Time slips away
Mankind corrupted, infected and afraid.

Human machine
Your life was programmed many years ago
Now it's time to set you free
Decode your dreams
Understand the truth that lies below
Shutdown... Reformat... Believe!

(Every day, carry out the same routine
9 to 5, cogs in the human machine
40 years, doing what they tell you to
Now you're old, is this what you waited for?)

(Can't you see, not the way it has to be
Make a choice, beauty of humanity
No regrets, I did what I wanted to
Time to die: you did what they told you to.)

3. Civilised?
Turned on the radio to hear
The tragic story of an boy of 7 years
Should be sleeping in his bed
Should be sleeping, but instead he's lying dead.

In a world where children lose their lives
Face the bullet, face the knife
Is this what we call being civilised?

Face the pain, it's all gone wrong
Who's to blame? It can go on
Can't rewind, what's done is done
When will we learn from the memories?

Face the pain, it's all gone wrong
Who's to blame? It can go on
Can't rewind, what's done is done
When will we learn from the memories?

What happened to our pleasant land?
Ignore the suffering, ignore the outstretched hand
That reaches out to us in vain
We are fortunate we don't end up the same.

In a world with nowhere left to run
Spiral downwards, damage done
Is this what we call being civilised?

Face the pain, it's all gone wrong
Who's to blame? It can go on
Can't rewind, what's done is done
When will we learn from the memories?

Face the pain, it's all gone wrong
Who's to blame? It can go on

Can't rewind, what's done is done
When will we learn from the memories?

4. Kings Of Eternity
A crash of thunder, lightning starts to glow
Standing in the rainstorm you feel so alone
And in the distance can you hear the sound of something new
The sun is hidden now, no rainbows can arise
All across the land the people look up to the skies
Can you see what's coming, do you understand what's gonna be?

Call our name and we'll be there
Stand beside us in the glory you'll share
We will be your guardians for all time.

Kings of Eternity, come to set you free
Breaking the chains for all humanity
Kings of Eternity, nothing left to fear
We are immortal, Kings of Eternity.

We stand among you, this dark and fateful night
Dispel the darkness in a blazing flash of light
We have all the answers; do you doubt that we can save you now?

We walk among you, we walk on higher ground
All of us together let us gather all around
Look into the future; see the way that things are gonna be

Call our name and we'll be there
Stand beside us in the glory you'll share
We will be your guardians for all time.

Kings of Eternity, come to set you free
Breaking the chains for all humanity
Kings of Eternity, nothing left to fear
We are immortal, Kings of Eternity.

Call our name and we'll be there
Stand beside us in the glory you'll share
We will be your guardians for all time.

Kings of Eternity, come to set you free
Breaking the chains for all humanity
Kings of Eternity, nothing left to fear
We are immortal, we are the Kings.

Kings of Eternity, come to set you free
Breaking the chains for all humanity
Kings of Eternity, nothing left to fear
We are immortal, Kings of Eternity.

5. Master Of Illusion
You paint a picture of what you want us to see
Masking the wreckage of our own reality
Ignoring genocide in corners of the world
You're only interested if there's some oil or gold.

Why don't you just reach out your hand
To people of your land?
You turn a blind eye to their plight
How can this be right?

You are the master, the master of illusion
Why don't you ever speak the truth?
You spell disaster, creating deep confusion
Why can't you see what can't you see what you have done?

Ignore the warning signs that come from mother earth
Evolving climate change, there cannot be rebirth
I read it in the news, I see it on TV
Forgotten faces could so easily be me.

You want to send them all to hell
You're going there as well (There as well)
What makes you act the way you do
I see right through you.

You are the master, the master of illusion
Why don't you ever speak the truth?
You spell disaster, creating deep confusion
Why can't you see what can't you see what you have done?

[Solo Monstruoso]

You are the master, the master of illusion
Why don't you ever speak the truth?
You spell disaster, creating deep confusion
Why can't you see what can't you see what you have done?

6. The Vigil
Gonna be the longest night all the angels take to flight
(No-one left to save you, darkness will enslave you)
There are many twists and turns, many lessons to be learned
(Do you yearn for daylight, can you feel the madness?)

Can you find some respite from the chaos in your mind?
Will you see the answers to your prayers?
You will know, some hours from now
If you will live till the day.

Redefine my way in life (Never be lonely)
Sanctify my fractured mind (Broken inside me)
Realign the dark and light (Closer than ever)
Sacrifice my tainted sight (Always behind me now)

I can feel them closing in and the nightmares now begin
(But you have to fight them, only don't believe them)
Tell you black is really white and that day is really night
(They will try to turn you, fingers poised to burn you!)

Can you find some respite from the chaos in your mind?
Will you see the answers to your prayers?
You will know, some hours from now
If you will live till the day.

Redefine my way in life (Never be lonely)
Sanctify my fractured mind (Broken inside me)
Realign the dark and light (Closer than ever)
Sacrifice my tainted sight (Always behind me now)

Can you find some respite from the chaos in your mind?
Will you see the answers to your prayers?
You will know, some hours from now
If you will live till the day.

Redefine my way in life (Never be lonely)
Sanctify my fractured mind (Broken inside me)
Realign the dark and light (Closer than ever)
Sacrifice my tainted sight (Always behind me now)

7. Save The World
This world ain't what it used to be
I'm fighting things I cannot see
I think there's something going on tonight
The future melted with the past
I don't know how long this can last
There's something out there but it don't feel right

Some things I recognise but others seem so strange
Can't believe I fully understand
How things can be one way and
Then suddenly they're turned upon their head.

Sometimes the world can be so blind
Can't see what's right before their eyes
And just deny that they can see things changing
Dance to the beat of a different drum
Imagine where it all went wrong
And try to prove that they just want to save the world.

Our leaders just don't seem to care
They sanction fighting everywhere
But what the hell is all this fighting for?
Then politicians take their leave
Leave the rest of us to grieve
And shed a tear for those who went to war.

Some things I recognise but others seem so strange
Can't believe I fully understand
How things can be one way and
Then suddenly they're turned upon their head.

Sometimes the world can be so blind
Can't see what's right before their eyes
And just deny that they can see things changing
Dance to the beat of a different drum
Imagine where it all went wrong
And try to prove that they just want to save the world.

So can't we all just live our lives?
So many people need not die
Why can't they see we are all flesh and blood?
There has to be another way
I don't care what our leaders say
I know that we can find a brighter day.

Sometimes the world can be so blind
Can't see what's right before their eyes
And just deny that they can see things changing
Dance to the beat of a different drum
Imagine where it all went wrong
And try to prove that they just want to save the world.

Sometimes the world can be so blind
Can't see what's right before their eyes
And just deny that they can see things changing
Dance to the beat of a different drum
Imagine where it all went wrong
And try to prove that they just want to save the world.

8. Hearts & Voices
In a time of restlessness.
We live in hate and fear
Fighting for religion.
As we face another year
Murder breeding murder, a new morality
Killing in the name of some immortal mystery.

For all eternity, we will stand as one
Coming from the corners of the world

Raise your hearts and voices
Raise your hearts and voices
Raise your hearts and voices
Now! (Raise them)

Raise your hearts and voices
Raise your hearts and voices
Raise your hearts and voices
Now! (Raise them now)

Can you see the justice, the reason for this crime?
Ain't no fight for freedom.
Can we really be so blind?
Brother stands with brother, don't need to be afraid
We are all the children and we must not fade away

For all eternity, we will stand as one
Coming from the corners of the world

Raise your hearts and voices
Raise your hearts and voices
Raise your hearts and voices
Now! (Raise them)

Raise your hearts and voices
Raise your hearts and voices
Raise your hearts and voices
Now! (Raise them now)

And we will find a way to stay together now
And send a message cross the stars.

Raise your hearts and voices
Raise your hearts and voices
Raise your hearts and voices
Now! (Raise them)

Raise your hearts and voices
Raise your hearts and voices
Raise your hearts and voices
Now! (Raise them now)

9. I Don't Believe In Friends Forever
You never know who you can trust
You never know who's gonna stab you in the back
Sometimes you just don't know your friends
Sometimes you gotta sleep with one eye open.

It's hard to know who's on your side and who's against
It's hard to recognise the truth behind the lies
Sometimes a moment, sometimes many, many years
You'll find it written in their eyes.

I don't believe in friends forever
I trusted you and you just shot me down
I don't believe in friends for forever
30 pieces of silver - it's over now.

Some people only think of them
Their deeds remind me what I never want to be
They have no reason to exist
All they do in life is count their money

It's hard to know who's on your side and who's against
It's hard to recognise the truth behind the lies
Sometimes a moment, sometimes many, many years
You'll find it written in their eyes.

I don't believe in friends forever
I trusted you and you just shot me down
I don't believe in friends for forever
30 pieces of silver - it's over now.

[Solo]

It's hard to know who's on your side and who's against
It's hard to recognise the truth behind the lies
Sometimes a moment, sometimes many, many years
You'll find it written in their eyes.

I don't believe in friends forever
I trusted you and you just shot me down
I don't believe in friends for forever
30 pieces of silver - it's over now.

10. Never Again
I always had a dream, pictures in the magazines
Want to be like all my hero's are
Will I die before I'm old; live the life of rock n' roll
Travel all the highways of the world.

I took the easy way
Turned my back and walked away
Didn't have the courage or the will
Sometimes it's hard to say
Question what I did that day
Now I know I'll hide away no more.

Never again will I hide myself in shadows
Never again will I look the other way
Never again will I take the easy option
Never again, I won't wait another day.

And now I'm standing here, metal anthems fill the air
Playing through the songs you all wanted to hear
Without you we will fall, you're the ones who heed the call
You're the ones who make the dream come true.

I took the easy way
Turned my back and walked away
Didn't have the courage or the will
Sometimes it's hard to say
Question what I did that day
Now I know I'll hide away no more.

Never again will I hide myself in shadows
Never again will I look the other way
Never again will I take the easy option
Never again, I won't wait another day.

Sometimes it seems another chance won't come my way
Won't stop believing that it might just be my day

[Solo]

Never again will I hide myself in shadows
Never again will I look the other way
Never again will I take the easy option
Never again, I won't wait another day.

11. Reckoning Day
[Megadeth Cover]

I like the way that I make you itch
And all the reasons I give you to bitch
And how I make you wanna scream in pain
And feel your life is just a losing game

I like the way that you let me in
The way you look when the walls cave in
I like the way that your stomach knots
And how you cry for it all to stop

I like the way that you fool yourself
And make believe there's nobody else
I like the way that you stand in line
And beg salvation from the empty skies (empty skies)

Don't want no revenge
Ain't no pay back time
It ain't called getting even
Here comes the reckoning day

I like the things that you try to fake
And your face when I see you break
And that you say you will pray for me
You realize you are prey for me

I like the way you stay on attack
No matter what, I keep coming back
And how you try to hold me down
But you end up driven to the ground (to the ground)

Don't want no revenge
Ain't no pay back time
It ain't called getting even
Here comes the reckoning day

[solo]

Don't want no revenge
Ain't no pay back time
It ain't called getting even
Here comes the reckoning day
Here comes the reckoning day


1. Find My Heaven
When the thunder rolls, lightening in the sky
Do you carry on regardless even though you all may die?
And when the sun burns down, draining you of life
Do you crumble in the desert; do you fight to stay alive?

So we ride over the mountains
Over the mountains that stand in our way
We will fly, higher and higher
Searching for destiny.

Where will I find my heaven?
Can it really be here on earth?
How can I know what's waiting?
How will I know what's meant for me?

When the devil calls, devil calls your name
Do you run like little children, running from the game?
And when the evil lies buried near your heart
Do you turn against your people, tearing them apart?

See the shadowland, hidden from the light
Feel the terror rising on this cold deserted night
Broken promises, not to be fulfilled
Never trust a demon, never fall under his will.

2. Galaxies Unknown
We all travel light and space
To find the answer to the question
Save the human race.
Far out to galaxies unknown
We'll never give searching
Always thinking of our home.

The sands of our existence running low
There's only one direction for us all to go.

Into the sky, high above where the eagle flies
We journey to find a new home
Beyond the stars where a new life will wait for us
Somewhere we all can belong.
Our world is dying as we speak
From policy and government
The future's looking bleak.
We all must stand up for what's right
The poor are getting poorer
And the planet won't survive.

Tired of the fighting destroying our world
Now is the time to be strong
No turning back, we are leaving today
Hoping to find our own way.
We cried an ocean full of tears
For those we left behind us
When we made the journey here
I hope that somehow they survive
The odds are stacked against them
In their Quest to stay alive.

3. Hold On To Love
This all happened many years ago
When you and I first met
We were strangers from different towns
The scene for us was set
Pretty soon we were hanging out
Spending time as friends
Didn't know what it's all about
The signals that you sent.

Closer now, don't think I will ever leave you
Never, ever say goodbye.

Hold on to Love, don't let it slip away
Hold on to Love, we'll take it day by day
When hearts are broken you will find
All that you had has been left behind
Whoo-ah! hold on to Love

You were there when my best friend died
To ease me through the pain
But you never seemed to realize
Was you that kept me sane
Looking back on everything that was
So many years ago
Do you ever think of all those times
When it was me and you?

4. Diamond Sky
I'm searching for glory and truth
You know it's not gonna be easy
Maybe I'm dreaming, but life is so cruel
The power is leading my heart.

Draw in your mind a utopian world
I want to break free and escape here
Don't wanna hide in the shadows no more
Follow me, it's not too late.

Now try to believe me
From now on you've all got to listen to me
We never will fall
Forever we'll be free

Fly over the sun, find a way out
Higher and higher
We'll ride together as one
Back to the Diamond Sky.

Show me the way that you try to survive
What is your only desire?
See the destruction around us tonight
Spread all our faith through the fire.

Fly over the sun, find a way out
Higher and higher
We'll ride together as one
Back to the Diamond Sky.
Fly over the sun, follow the light
Holding your life
We'll ride together as one
Straight to the Diamond Sky

We'll climb all the hills and the mountains
Right now through the clouds we will find
The saviour that keeps all our lives
Leading us to the sky.

We are the ones that will save human kind
Fight for a place we can stay in
Send me a sign if you still wanna try
Look for the truth once again

5. The Message
I saw you turn and walk away
I never thought that day would be the last day
We would ever meet.
Looking back on all we had
We had each other and that was enough for us
Didn't need any more.

Now it's time to leave again
Time to travel many miles
I will think of you tonight.

And I wake up all alone
A message on my phone
Saying you've left me - for another guy
And you say I'm never home
I'm always on the road
But I still love you more that you'll ever know.

I guess we never really knew
How things would change for the and for you
Couldn't see it at all
Said you wanted me to stay
I heard your words but there was no way
I could give up my dream.

6. Soulfire
The light around me turns to grey
I'm falling
Memories of yesterday
Recalling

Something's changed but I don't know why
And I don't know where I should turn
Re-arranged all the sands of time
Blood in my veins stars to burn.

Soulfire, burning forever
Soulfire, a flame in the night
Guiding the way like a lamp in the darkness
Soulfire always burns in sacred light.

See the remnants of forgotten dreams
Evolving
Places I was sure that I had been
Dissolving

7. Children Of The Dream
When I was young, spent my time just dreaming
Moving on to find a better life.
Seen enough of sorrow to last me all my days
Heard enough of how it doesn't have to be that way.

All I ever wanted was to keep the dream alive
All I ever needed was someone to be my guide.
How was I to know where the road of life would go
Could I make the journey on my own?

We're all Children of the Dream
That lives in us unseen
Forever young.
We're all Children of the Dream
Wherever we may be
Forever dream.

As I grew up, start to see how life goes
Reality that childhood has to end.
Funny how those teenage years seem long but pass on by
Funny how the memories resemble someone else's life.

All is lost, innocence is gone forever
Hope the dream will never end.

8. Strike Force
When you feel in danger
Everyone's a stranger now
What more can you do?
When you feel uncertain
Behind a twitching curtain, yeah
Where else can you go?

All alone, there's no one left for you
Fear unknown, they're coming for you too.
Close to tears, the ending of the years
Who is gonna come and save you now?

Send for the Strike Force to come and deliver you now
Call on the Strike Force we'll come and put right what went wrong
It won't take us long !

If you feel like lying
Gonna end up dying soon
They will hunt you down
Don't you know the answer?
Will you take a chance right now?
There's nothing left to lose.

9. Another World
Another time, another space
I don't know if you'll hear me calling to you
Through the night, this endless night
I don't know if I'll ever find my way home.

I see around me only emptiness
I don't know where my world has gone
It feels like I just don't belong.

Now we live in different worlds
Far across the universe
No return, I'll journey no more
Try to put right what went wrong.

Blazing spires and rapid fire
I see ruins of a temple before me
Inside out and outside in
Can this be what is left of the world that I was in?

Searching high, searching low
Finding the way that will take me back to you
Choice is made I cannot leave
Sacrifice myself to this world of sin.

10. Magic Never Dies
It started long ago, when stories still were told
And heroes still defended their world
The centuries went by and all the stories died
And no one knew that magic survived.

The last of the mage line
Conjured a spell that would live forever
A chant and a rift in time
He journeyed into the unknown.

Whatever the future may bring
The magic will remain in all of us
Whatever the danger we face
Together we will all be strong enough
To find our salvation in life
To follow the ways of old
You can be sure in the one thing we know
Magic never dies.

The kingdom of the night, against the mages might
Has battled since the dawning of time
With darkness all around, a ray of hope is found
To save us from destroying our world

The world will be at peace, the west and in the east
When people learn the ways of the light
And stories will be told, just as in days of old
And magic lives in all our souls

11. The Longest Night
We've come so far again
No chance to turn away
We've come too far to falter now or be afraid.

Way beyond endurance is the place that we are thrown
Hungry and weak
We are tired and alone.

We must go on - don't listen to the devil's song
We must go on - to build the Promised Land again.

The longest night - shattered by the morning light
Breaking through the darkness with the power of hope inside me
The farthest land - conquered by the heart of man
Tearing through the darkness with the power of hope to guide me.

Desolate and barren is the place that we now dwell
Torn apart and dying now
The final living hell.

He may wait for us to fall
But we won't bow in fear to his demands and calls.

We may run to distant shores
But we will not kow-low to his desires or petty laws

2. Rising Anew
I've seen the writing on the wall, believe me
I know they wanted us to fall away
They criticised our every move, deceivers
They never wanted us to break their chains

[Chorus I:]
They sit in judgement and they think they know it all
They act like gods but they are human after all
I don't care what they say
They just want to shoot us down in flames

[Chorus II:]
Rising anew, in from the cold
Ready to strike, never grow old
No one can ever hold us down
Rising again, back on the streets
We have the power to believe
No one on earth can stop us now

The words they write are not the truth, I've seen them
Refuse to open up their eyes and ears
For you my friends we carry on, believers
The Quest will always be what makes us strong

[Chorus I]
[Chorus II]

[Solo / Interlude]

[Chorus II]

3. Glorious
We are the chosen ones, marching out to distant lands
I don't know when we will return
So many miles from home, lonely road we travel on
We have a mission to fulfill

[Chorus I:]
Over rainbows and stars
You can be sure I'll be there
When you're feeling alone
These are the words that will lift up your heart

[Chorus II:]
Glorious
Sunrise in Eden, the will to go on
Glorious
Never surrender, our lives will be glorious

Forever we are free, standing here in unity
No one can ever bring us down
Beyond the fires of hell, deep inside a wishing well
You'll find the answers that you seek

[Chorus I]
[Chorus II]

[Solo / Interlude]

[Chorus I]
[Chorus II]
[Chorus II]

4. Sacrifice
I saw it in your eyes
You left me paralysed
Now I can't remember how I felt before
Was it all in vain?
Another losing game
I can feel the fire that rages in my heart

This ain't the time to be afraid
You're not the only one who feels this way

[Chorus:]
Sacrifice - sacrifice my life
To be with you tonight
Sacrifice - nowhere left to hide
I need you by my side
Sacrifice - all the wrongs seem right
Don't leave me here alone
Sacrifice - steal away my soul
I want you to know

[Solo / Interlude]

It's only you and me
The way it's meant to be
It was written long ago before we walked the earth
I will depend on you
For you to pull me through
Climb the highest mountain to be right by your side

[Chorus]

[Solo / Interlude]

This ain't the time to be afraid
You're not the only one who feels this way

[Chorus]

5. Survive
World of confusion
Face oblivion
Veil of illusion
Everything is wrong

Leaders they fail us
Just don't have a prayer
Serving self interest
No one really cares

[Chorus I:]

After all is said and done
There's nothing left to lose
Has the story finally ended tonight?
Have you made your final move?
The sands are running low
Can you see a new horizon tonight?

[Chorus II:]

We can run, we can hide
We can say our last goodbye
Heaven knows, we're all too young to die
We can fight, we can try
Living under the same sky
Be aware, don't be scared
We'll survive

Power of deception
Growing every day
Communication
Nothing left to say

Heart of a lion
To fight their evil ways
We're only human
We must not be afraid

[Chorus I]
[Chorus II]

[Solo / Interlude]

Looking back on better days
Can't believe that we have fallen so far
Who can help us find our way?
Who can take away their power and set us all free?

[Solo / Interlude]

[Chorus II]
[Chorus II]

6. Better Days
Talk about a better day
Don't know what you heard
In the end your actions speak louder than words
Do you want the easy way
You're so unprepared
Let me know when you have decided to care

[Chorus I:]
I'm never giving in
I'm reaching for the stars
I'll never falter now
I've come so far

[Chorus II:]
Living the life that I've got to live
All I've ever dreamed of
Giving it all that I've got to give

Thought about another way
Could I break the rules
Time to be the master, not one of the fools
Only getting older
Will not be afraid
In the end there's nothing that can't be changed

[Chorus I]
[Chorus II]
[Chorus II]

[Solo / Interlude]

[Chorus I]
[Chorus II]
[Chorus II]

7. Crunching The Numbers
We fell on harder times than we had known before
Heading for tomorrow full of fear
Unemployment riding high, the country on its knees
Heading for disaster so it seems

[Chorus I:]
We worked so hard but for no return
Money just slipping through our hands
What can we do now but carry on
Fingers to the bone

[Chorus II:]
Don't believe the things you read or see upon the TV screen
From your own conclusions, practice what you preach
Time has come to realise, economy is jeopardised
Where does that leave us now?

[Chorus III:]
Crunching the numbers is all we can do
Hope there's enough left for me and you
Cross the line, the great divide
Crunching the numbers from black into red
Hope to survive, not to end up dead
Can this be what is left for me?

We put our trust in those who said they wouldn't fail
Find the right investment for us all
Stocks and shares and banking institutions up for sale
Everything we worked for ends in tears

[Chorus I]
[Chorus II]
[Chorus III]

[Solo / Interlude]

[Chorus III]

8. Only In My Dreams
She's an angel, running all night through the badlands
Trying to find her way home
Hiding her eyes from the sandman
Till morning breaks through she's alone
Searching the dark like a radar
Trying so hard to believe
Avoiding the glare of the hangman
She reaches for someone to hold

[Chorus I:]
If she only knew, I'll be right there with her forever
How can I explain the feelings that I know are true?

She's in danger, hearing her voice in the silence
Trying to find a way through
Feeling the eyes of a stranger
Burning so deep in her soul
Look at her now she's surrounded
Searching so hard for the light
Memories of heartbreak, confusion
I won't let her out of my sight

[Chorus I]

[Chorus II:]
Hold me now and stay forever
Till the sky comes crashing down
Save me now, I can't remember
If you're only in my dreams

[Solo / Interlude]

[Chorus I]
[Chorus II]
[Chorus II]

9. Blood Alliance
Locked in our hearts are secrets
Never to be told
Deep in our minds are wishes
Never to unfold
We are the small communion
Hide behind closed doors
Born of a blood alliance
Beyond the realms of law

[Chorus I:]
Promise of truth passed to us all
Father to son, heritage calls
Follow the path, follow the sign
Keepers of faith as long as we stay alive

[Chorus II:]
Forever we will be guardians of the flame
Creating history, we don't reveal our name
We're not so innocent, we call for mercy
We are the ones who will remain unheard of

We are the sworn protectors
Legacy of old
We are the isolated
Condemned to walk alone
Code of the esoteric
Buried deep in time
We hold the only cipher
Ministry of crime

[Chorus I]
[Chorus II]

[Solo / Interlude]

Where are the new messiahs?
Prophets of the age
We are the true disciples
Shadow renegades
We hear the distant echo
Calling down the years
We are the lonely angels
Hidden but always near

[Chorus I]
[Chorus II]

10. City Of Lies
They thought the streets were paved with gold
And riches still untold
They didn't realise the truth
I heard the stories long ago
How young men went alone
Searching for fortune and for fame

A final chance to make amends
The phoenix from the flames
Evolving tales from history
Carry our hope for all these years
And letting go your fears
To leave the mark on Neverworld

[Chorus I:]
And when the daylight fades, it's dangerous outside
Don't walk the streets alone, you just might not survive
Out there in the shadows they are waiting there for you
Waiting for the moment to arrive

[Chorus II:]
Nowhere to hide in the city of lies
No one to turn to, life's on the line
Nothing to save you from what you'll become
Caught in a web, trapped in the city of lies

I see the truth with my own eyes
There's nothing to disguise
A city now consumed by crime
There are no rainbows and no gold
Just nightmares to be sold
To desperate souls on borrowed time

[Chorus I]
[Chorus II]

[Solo / Interlude]

[Chorus I]
[Chorus II]

Nothing to save you from what you'll become
Caught in a web, trapped in the city of lies

11. Time To Burn
[Bonus track]

We are responsible, we cannot shake the blame
We have the scientific knowledge to remain
United Nations, do they really stand as one?
Subversive politics, but surely this is wrong

[Chorus I:]
It's safe to say that it won't happen in our lifetime
But that's no reason to ignore the warning signs

[Chorus II:]
Time - there'll be no long goodbyes
There's no way to survive
This world is lost forever
Burn - there's no air left to breathe
There's no one here to grieve
Life is finally over

It's time to burn

We have the evidence, we cannot turn and leave
We are the generation haunted by disease
Some day when we are gone, our planet on its knees
Maybe they'll question why we flattered to deceive

[Chorus I]
[Chorus II]

It's time to burn

Across the universe, an echo far away
Another planet dies, another born today
After millennia when others take our place
I hope they learn from our mistakes

[Solo / Interlude]

[Chorus I]
[Chorus II]

It's time to burn
