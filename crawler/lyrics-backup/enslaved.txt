1. Slaget I Skogen Bortenfor (Epilog / Slaget)
Strokes from oars could be heard,
beautiful ships gushed through the sea
Like a wind from the north,
our ancestors reached the shore
Men from Hordaland, Rogaland and Adger
gathered for battle in common
Proud men with no fear
Strokes from the sword crushed the skull of the christian

A long time we ruled, kings of the north
Many battles we won, at the shores of Midgard
But, betrayed by our own brothers
we were forced down on our knees
Now when the wind once again is howling
the thoughts finally goes towards home
We shall rise in our glory
The white horde will for sure shiver

"We died like men
Therefore we never vanished
Weak is the one the enemy loves
Never betray your origin"

1. Frost
[instrumental]

2. Loke
Laughter echoes through the night
The evening star shines over Midgard
Evil mingles in the dark
The organised cosmos' enemy comes forth

Loke, the son of Fårbaute.. father of lies
Born of earth, unbound by laws

Takk weeps no heavy tears
For the loss of the sun's handsome son
But the mare in the woods submits
For the regaining of Foster brother's favour

Loke, the son of Fårbaute.. father of lies
Born of earth, unbound by laws

The salmon glides in the waterfall
The eagle sails with the wind
Hammer groans in Jotun scull
The under ground spurts fire

Laughter, deceit, beauty and contempt
The old norse god's protector and leader of Jotuns

3. Fenris
Glem alle lover, all orden og fred
Kaos er allt; ingen tid eller sted
Nå når alt lys og liv tar slutt
Når vinden nå dreper;
Lenkene er brutt!

Tiden er kommet
som nornene forutså
intet varer evig
slaget på Vigrid skal stå
det finnes ingen brødre
det finnes ingen sterke band
Det brundne raseri er løs
indre kulde er fri
en elv av fråde
er tørket ut
Ulvens kraft, det dunkle hat
Ser ikke lenger en grense
Ty. Din hånd for fred du gav
Men de siste sår kan fred ei lindre

Angrboda med rette
bar sitt navn
med Lauvøus sønn hun alvet frem
angst, hat og død
et varselskrik I mørket
bergets røtter, Bjørnesner
Kvinneskjegg, kattetrinns lyd
pust fra fisken , fuglens spytt
temmede krefter fra svunnen tid
boldt Vår ulv lenket
Mene i til evig tid

Fenris er løs!

Nå er vår visdom
Slukt av gammelt hat
De ni skritt er fullendt
En ny vei er lagt

[English translation:]

Forget all laws, all order and peace
Chaos is everything; no time or place
Now when all light and life ends
When the wind now is killing
The chains has broken...

The time has come
As the norns predicted
Nothing lasts forever
The battle at Vigrid shall come
There is no brothers
There is no strong bounds
The bound anger is loose
Inner coldness is free
A river of foam
Has dried up
The power of the wolf, obscure hate
No longer sees a limit

Angrboda beared
Her name justly
With Lauyíus son she breeded
Dread, hate and death
A cry of warning in the dark
The mountains roofs, bear tendors
Woman beard, the sound of catsteps
Breath from the fish, spit from the bird
Tamed forces from a forgotten time
Has held our world in chains
But not for ever!

Fenris is loose

Now our wisdom
Is swallowed by ancient hate
The nine steps are fulfilled
A new road is lain

4. Black Mountain Plateaus (Svarte Vidder)
The ravens are flying, the one eyed watches
Into the fog, shadows appear
Memories from the first empire covered with gold
Runes scratched in, scratches in by hatred
The hordes of the one eyed are riding once again
Hammer crushes cross
Inverted by the unbound
Dark clouds gather, the light retreats

Burned landscape, where it earlier bloomed
Battle fields for the first
A black empire, eternal winter
Frozen fields, eternal cold
Lightening and thunder commands from the first
Eternal storms, an evil monsoon
A wall of darkness
The voice is calling, the circle completed

The age of wolves
Hunger and despair
Mother earth
Expect your death

Warriors are gathered through the dream
Re-conquering the old norse throne
Under new flags
With the swords held high
The ravens are flying, the one eyed watches
Into the fog, shadows appear
Falling icons in a holy war
Black mountain plateaus the battle is won

The age of wolves
Hunger and despair
Mother earth
Expect your death

5. Yggdrasil
I know that I hung
In the windcold tree
Nine whole nights
With hurt point
To Oden given
Self given to myself
In that tree
Which nobody knows
From which roots it ran

not given bread
They brought no horns
Saw down from the tree
Took up runes
Took them with screams
And down from the tree I fell

Nine magic songs I got
From the famous son of
Boltorn, Bestlas father
And a drink I got
Of precious mead
Poured by Odrere

Then I became vigorous
And got wise
Grew and felt well
Of word sought word
Me word again
Of work sought work
Me work again

6. Jotunblod
Bottomless abyss, ginnungagap
Darkness without end before the morning of time
The cold empire's eleven rivers frozen
Frost mist spreads itself wide out
The gust from Nivlhel in the north fills the mighty gap
Licking tongues of fire from the south
Boiling, bubbling venom

All life has it's origin in a source of
Jotunblood
Your mind's own evil inner:
Jotunblood

Screams from Hvergelmes source
United with nauseating drops of venom
The first, the father of all families
Created by the two elements
With himself he breeded
Our proud ancestors
Our primitive force's deep roots
With energy from the cattle's four rivers

A knife through the dark
A shrill scream
A pale face foams
He wanders proudly over Ymer's bones

All life has it's origin in a source of
Jotunblood
Your mind's own evil inner:
Jotunblood

If one seeks all Midgard's knowledge
If the wise woman swings her staff
One can not avoid one's origin
The chaos of the primitive force:
Jotunblood

7. Gylfaginning
He wandered on fine old paths
He wandered along high ridges
He wandered towards the heart of Midgard
He wandered until he saw a mountain

Over a bridge wet with dew he walked
Through the golden gate of Asgard
He saw the vigorous gardens of gods
Crowned around the father of All's high castle

'O father of all, I Ganglere ask:
How have we all come to existence and where do we end?
Answer, O high, even high and third
what is mankind and the race of gods' faith?'

Gylfaginning, deception for he who was wrongly taught
But not for the one who knows Gylfaginning
Grimnes revelation

8. Wotan
Naked, waste landscape
Vast plains lead to the seashore in the west
A northern wind sweeps over dead bodies
A stranger has entered the domains of the vikings

Die not lying sick, dastardly coward
Draw sword, fight with the war gods
Wotan!

We shall fight until we see Ritrost
We shell fight until Heimdal flows the Gjallarhorm
We shall fight for our domains
We shall fight with the war gods
Wotan!

Die not lying sick, dastardly coward
Draw sword, fight with the war gods
Wotan!

9. Queen Of The Ice Desolates (Isöders Dronning)
On the balcony she beholds and longs
Queen of the ice desolates
Alone and weeping she bears the sorrow
Queen of the ice desolates

In the land where day is night and night is day
Bulks a castle with walls of ice, covered with white frost
Outside these walls exists no life
Memories of warmth frozen into snow crystals

In the land where the wind weeps, the child of tragendy lives
Horn of frost and cold, dressed in the snow
Bears who form to pearls run from her eyes
...Memories of joy frozen into pearls of ice

the woman in the castle of ice bears the curse
There where she will die
Queen of the ice desolates

A lonely raven passes by
It seeks further on towards the warmth
On wings it is free
The woman in the castle bears the curse
There she will die, but will anybody
Remember?


5. Heimdallr
[performed by Enslaved]Heimdall is the name of an Old Norse God; 
He is called the Old White Norse God; 
He is great and holy; 
His teeth are made of gold; 
His horse is named Goldtop. 
He lives where it's called the mountain in the sky besides 
Bifrost. 
He needs less sleep than a bird; 
He sees night as clear as day 
One thousand miles away from where he is; 
He also hears the grass grow from the soil, 
Or the wool on the sheep and everything that can be heard. 
He possess the horn that is called the Gjallarhorn, 
And they can hear him blowing the horn in all the homes.

1. 793 (Slaget Om Lindisfarne)
[793 (The Battle Of Lindisfarne)]

[Lyrics by Grutle Kjellson 1995/96]
[Music by Ivar Bjørnson 1995/96]

Strokes from oars could be heard,
Beautiful ships gushed through the sea
Like a wind from the north,
Our ancestors reached the shore
Men from Hordaland, Rogaland and Adger
Gathered for battle in common
Proud men with no fear
Strokes from the sword crushed the skull of the christian

A long time we ruled, kings of the north
Many battles we won, at the shores of Midgard
But, betrayed by our own brothers
We were forced down on our knees
Now when the wind once again is howling
The thoughts finally goes towards home
We shall rise in our glory
The white horde will for sure shiver

"We died like men
Therefore we never vanished
Weak is the one the enemy loves
Never betray your origin"

[Norwegian]

Åretak hørtes, vakre langskip fosset frem
Som en vind fra nord, kom våre fedre i land
Horder, Ryger og Egder, samlet til felles strid
Staute menn uten frykt
Sverdslag knuste kristmanns skalle

Lenge herkset vi, Nordens konger
Mange slag vi vant ved Midgards strender
Men, sveket av våre enge, ble vi tvunget ned i kne
Når vinden nå igjen jager, vender tankene omsider hjem
Vi skal reise oss i vår prakt
Sannelig skal kvitehorden skjelve

"Vi falt som menn
Derfor døde vi ei hen
Veik er den som fiender elsker
Svik ei ditt opphav"

2. Hordalendingen
[The Man From Hordaland]

[Lyrics by Grutle Kjellson 1995]
[Music by Ivar Bjørnson 1995]

Waves are cutting like a knife of time
On the slippery rocks that still stands besides the shore
Two eyes are eyeing the seas
Towards the seas that once brought his ancestors glory

A lonely mind is longing
For the raising of sails
A swordarm is longing hungrily
To cut the throats of cowards

A forgotten treasure is now recovered
Brought out from the darkness of Midgard
Its powers will never again disappear
It is guarded by a man from Hordaland

A night of sorrow will soon be over
Memories from ancient times will glow
A wind blows away the dust from an ancient sword
Two ravens will predict his return

The sets in the west
He lifts his proud face
He looks towards the North Star
The Man From Hordaland

[Norwegian]

Bølgene skærer som en tidens kniv
På de glatte svaberg som ennå står
To øyne skuer utover de hav
Som i fordums tider bar hans slekt til heder

Et stille sinn lengter
Etter atter å heise seil
En sverdram hungrer
Etter nidmanns strupe

En bortglemt skatt er nå gjennfunnet
Båret ut fra Midgards mørke
Den kraft skal aldri mer forsvinne
Den voktes av en mann fra Hordaland

En sorgtung natt er snart over
Et fordums minne lyser opp
En vind blåser støv fra et gammelt sverd
To ravner varsler hans komme

Solen går ned i vest
Han løfter sitt stolte ansikt
Han skuer mot Nordstjernen
Mannen fra Hordaland

3. Alfablot
[Sacrifice To The Elves]

[Lyrics by Grutle Kjellson 1993/96]
[Music by Ivar Bjørnson 1996]

Bring forth your sacrifice
The winter can last for long
Show them honour
Servants of Frey
Let the blood flow
On his pride
Until they are pleased
To provide our magnificense and growth

Our king will show his wrath
If we do not honour our promise
Poor the harvest will be
Without seeds in earth

Don't spill the finest blood
Strong sons will not be born too often

"Oh, wise Volve when shall I get to see, fields of growth
When shall I once again feel the light touch from Freyas hands"

Death comes fast
If you do not honour
The people below
The friends of the Vanirs
Bring forth
The holy boar
Then the sun will still shine
And we can still breath

We didn't wish to die
We didn't wish to awake
The wrath of the elders
Bring forth the holy boar

[Norwegian]

Bring frem ditt offer
Vinteren kan lett bli lang
Vis dem ære
Frøys undersåtter
La blodet renne
Over hans stolthet
Til de er begjæret
For vår prakt og vår grøde

Vred blir vår konge
Hvis ei vårt løfte blir holdt
Skral blir den avling
Som ei er blitt sådd

Spill ei det beste blod
Sterke sønner fødes ei i overflod

"Kloke volve når skal jeg få se, Grøderike enger"
"Når skal jeg igjen få føle, Frøyas myke hender"

Døden kommer fort
Om en ikke ærer
Folket der under
Vaneguders frender
Bring fram
Den hellige Galte
Så solen ikke slukner
Så vi fremdeles kan ånde

Vi ønsket ei å dø
Vi ønsket ei å vekke
De eldstes harme
Bring fram den hellige Galte

Spill ei det beste blod
Sterke sønner fødes ei i overflod

"Kloke volve når skal jeg få se, Grøderike enger
"Når skal jeg igjen få føle, Frøyas myke hender"

4. Kvasirs Blod
[The Blood of Kvasir]

[Lyrics by Grutle Kjellson 1996]
[Music by Ivar Bjørnson & Grutle Kjellson 1996]

A war ruled in ancient times
Between the holy races, the Vanirs and the Aces
When peace came, the deities united
From a bowl filled with spit rose Kvasir

"Wise he becomes, he drinks the holy mead
The blood of Kvasir, but not he who drinks
From the spilled mead that dripped
From the falcon"

Kvasir the father of poets by dwarf hands he died
From the blood of Kvasir they made the mead of poets,
The holy drink
Fjalar and Galar once murdered Gilling the Giant,
The father of Suttung
Enraged, Suttung demanded justice to be fullfilled
The blood of Kvasir became the mead of Suttung

Grimne flew out from Valhalla
In the shape of the falcon
To the home of Giants and to Nitberg
Bauge was decived, and Gunnlod betrayed

Out from Nitberg the falcon flew
Finally Kvasir should return to Aasgard
But when the mead disappeared Suttung became furious
Out, in the shape of the eagle he followed
Sadly, Grimne had to spill from his valuable treasure
Which led to the making of the false poets
The falcon flew home to his domains
And Suttung flew into the flames of Tjalve

[Norwegian]

I gammel tid hersket det en krig
Mellom de hellige slekter, baner og æser
Da freden kom, ble guddommene forent
Opp fra et kar med spytt steg Kvarsir

"Vis blir den som drikker av mjøden,
Kvarsis blod, men ei den som drikker
Av den spillte mjød som dryppet fra
Falkens ham"

Kvarsir, hvis skalders far han var,
Ble tatt av dage av dvergehender
Av Kvarsirs blod lagde de skaldemjøden deh hellige drikk
Fjalar og Galar myrdet en gang Gilling jotun, Suttungs far
I Sinne krevde Suttung mannebot
Kvarsir blod ble Suttungs mjød

Ut fra Valhall flasket Grimne
Kledd opp i falkens drakt
Til Jotunheimen og Nitberg
Bauge bie narret og Gunnlod sveket

Ut fra Nitberg falken fløy
Omsider skulle Kvarsir hjem,
Men da mjøden forsvant ble Suttung vred
Ut han styrtet i ørneham

Akk, måtte Grimne slippe dyrebar last
Slik ble de falske skalder skapt
Falken fløy hjem til sin borg
Og suttung inn i Tjalves flammer

5. For Lenge Siden
[A Long Time Ago]

[Lyrics by Grutle Kjellson 1995]
[Music by Ivar Bjørnson 1995]

Hymns were sung
In the times when our people still were proud
In the long gone past
A long time ago

Then came the disease
The disease from south
Deception and false knowledge
Infected our minds

Survival of the fittest was forgotten
But still it didn't disappear
Beneath the layers of a thousand years of deception
Burns the ancient northern thoughts

Fight! Don't let your powers disappear
Our sunset shall also be our dawn

They burned our temples
They killed our men
We shall take back
What once were ours

Fight! Deny not your mind
Our sunset shall also be our dawn

We shall once again sing
Hymns from ancient times
Like we did in those days
A long time ago

[Norwegian]

Lovsanger ble sunget
Den gang folket fremdeles var stolt,
I de svundne tider,
For lenge siden

Så kom pesten
Pesten fra sør
Svik og vranære
Forpestet våre sinn

Den sterkes lov ble glemt
Men forsvant ei
Under et lag av tusen års svik
Ulmer den norrøne tanke

Kjemp! La ei din kraft forgå
Vår morgen skal også bli vår kveld

De brente våre hov
De drepte våre menn
Vi skal ta tilbake
Det som engang var vårt

Kjemp! Fornekt et ditt sinn
Vår morgen skal også bli vår kveld

Vi skal igjen synge
Lovsanger fra fordums tid
Slik vi gjorde i de dager
For pesten kom
FOR LENGE SIDEN

6. Glemt
[Forgotten]

[Lyrics and Music by Ivar Bjørnson]

The silence inside this place is screaming
Here, were the roses never wither, as they never bloomed
Here the sun never shone
Even the darkness never came in

No hope, no fear
An ocean of tears, that never fell
Tomorrow brings remembrance of opened wounds
The light invaded the endless darkness

A soul, which birth was denied
A soul that became forgotten

The darkness fades away even the brightest colour
The street is empty, and leads to nowhere
A shrilling scream, that no one heard
Who cares? We can all be free

"Tomorrow is a new day
But today was new as well...
... For only thing is fear fealt
The fear of life"

Fallen asleep, wrapped in a blood red blanket
Two dead eyes are staring into emptiness
From a soul, which birth was denied
Death greets the one life forgot

[Norwegian]

Hvor stillheten er øredøvende her inne
Hvor rossene aldri visner, da de aldri blomstret
Her fant solen aldri frem
Selv mørket snur i døren

Intet håp, ingen frykt
Et hav av tårer som aldri rant
Morgendangen bringer bud om åpnede sår
Lyset invaderte det endeløse mørket

Den klareste farge blir dim om natten
Gaten er tom og leder ingensteds
Et strik som skar, men ingen hørte
Hvem bryr seg? Vi kan alle bli fri

"I morgen er en ny dag,
Men det var også i dag...
...Blott den ene frykten kjennes
Frykten for lyvet"

Sovnet inn, i ei blodrødt pledd
To døde øyne stirrer tomt
Fra en sjel som ble nekter født
Døden hilset den som lyvet glemte

7. Eld
[Fire]

[Lyrics by Grutle Kjellson 1996]
[Music by Ivar Bjørnson & Grutle Kjellson 1996]

Born in a flames in the time before time
In the sparkling embrace of Muspellheim
Born to be your souls darked depths
Before Audhumla, our ancient mother awakened

When your eyes is glowing with hate
A hate older than both men and gods
Then you see the light of Muspell
To strong for any man to tame
The oldest force will man never understand
In the deepest domains of fire, man can never reign

Stronger than the grip of death
Mightier than the lights of Norns
Wiser than Fimbul-Tul
More betraying than the son of Faarbaute

That, who once brought forth life
And gave us Mother Earth
Shall return in the flames of Surt
Our flesh shall burn at Ragnarok
Our souls shall be united in FROST & FIRE

1. Living Beneath The Hammer
Windswept landscape, desolated mountain plateaus
The Deepest woods and darkest scrubs
Flords and mountains are our landmarks
in a life beneeath the Hammer

A long and narrow kingdom
Ruled by trinity
From stormy mountain tops covered with snow
We behold the kingdom of the Hammer

We ride along the paths of Midgard
Fog from the soil rises at our feets
To the west the shore can be seen,
where the first sat foot ashore
Where they raised sail towards north

2. A Winter's Night
A dark, chilling winters night
Unsilently awoken by song and dance
From above rains the golden arrows of Thor
Moonbeams enlighten the ring

Nine torches for those nine in the circle
Surrounded by nine shadows for nine souls
In the middle, an altar of fire, soil, water and wind
Look, and behold yourself

3. Fires Of Midgard
The call of the Gjallarhorn
Return to the ring of our forefathers gods
The flames of Midgard's fires and ancient mystisism still are

]sg}rdsreien rides with terror above the village
Mjolner is swung, thunder and lightening!
The landmarks of the Vikings
Wolves and ravens guards the throne

4. Heimdallr
Heimdall is the name of an Old Norse God;
he is called the Old White Norse God;
he is great and holy;
his teeth are made of gold;
his horse is named Goldtop.
He lives where it's called the mountain in the sky besides
Bifrost.
He needs less sleep than a bird;
he sees night as clear as day
one thousand miles away from where he is;
he also hear the grass grow from the soil,
or the wool on the sheep and everything that can be heard.
He possess the horn that is called the Gjallarhorn,
and they can hear him blowing the horn in all the homes.

2. I Lenker Til Ragnarok
[Loke - del II]
[##-Voluspå]
[Tekst: Grutle Kjellson]

Eiteren drypp, jorda skakar
Eg vrir meg i smerte, lenka til berget

Eg er din angst, eg er din pine.
Tema meg du freista, du fanga meg i garn.
Eg let meg ikkje rokka, eg er kaos
eg er din skam.

Eg er din øvste visdoms bror,
og din fiende til din døyande dag.

Bunden eg er, men eg ler av deg.
Tru ikkje eg er til for å tena deg.

Eg er av ei verd du aldri (i ditt liv) kan skjøna,
for eg er vondskap, eg er urkraft.

Ein dag skal me møtast på Vigridsletta.
Ein dag er eg fri for lenker og eiter.
Den dagen vil du skjøna kvifor eg blei til,
kvifor latteren gjallar i natta.
Den dagen skal me kjempa vår siste kamp,
og ta kvarandre av dage.
# ...Sola svartnar, jord sig i hav
på hummelen bleiknar bjarte stjerner
Røyken velatr fra veldige bål
Høgt leikar flammen
mot himmelen sjøl... #

[English translation: IN CHAINS UNTILL RAGNAROK]

[Lyrics: Grutle Kjellson]
[## Voluspå]

The ether is dripping, the earth is quaking
I am writhing with agony, chained to the mountain

I am your fear, I am your torment
You attemped to tame me, you caught me in nets
I will not be budged, I am chaos, I am your shame

I am your highest wisdom, and your enemy
'til your dying day

Bound I am, but I am laughting  at you
Do not believe that I am here to serve you

I am from a world you can not comprehend
'Cause I am Evil I am the Primal Force

One day we shall meet at the fields of Vigrid
One we  I shall be free of chains and ether
That day you will understand
The purpose of my excistance 
Why the laughter is roaring in the night
Åhat day we will fight our last battle
Ônd end eachothers  days

#The sun turns black, ground slides into the sun
Brave stars are fading in the sky
Smoke rises from great fires
The flame plays up high
Against heaven itself#

[Music: Ivar Bjørnson]

3. Urtical Gods
[Lyrics: Dirge Rep]

Activate the aggression that exposes the
Hidden,
Denying the existance  pf  praying to
Illusions
Seek gnosis in the forbidden
Drink from the wates of knowledge
And see what lies you breathe

Absorb the vital spark of deities false
And ressurect the true gods
To whom strength and wisdom is the key
And not the lectures of folly
Annoint your sould  with pleasure
Apposed  to mummifications through impotence

The truth is unconscious, asleep
Waiting to be summoned, to be worshipped
A neglected phallos, banished from thought
A weapon overseen by the creator
But cherished by those of the path
Unlock the beast
Transform

4. Ansuz Astral
[Tekst: Ivar Bjørnson]

ANSUZ, ANSUZ!
- Skipet fa frå kai
Aldri vil ho vende att;
ho er trygg i stjernenatt

WUNJO, WUNJO!
- Reisa har vërt lang
Han som sød kjem draumen til;
tek han dit han draume vil

Vidare frå tanken;
fri frå kjød
Ingen svar, ingen sirkel
Evig fødsel, evig død

"...Eg tok og eg fekk
Eg fall, flaug og gjekk
Det vart mørkt og eg såg
Djupt ned, kor det tyste rår..."

Me vandra fritt og langt
Lyset kom, og synet svann
Husa er tomme, og himmelen raud;
Skipet legg frå kai

[Musikk: Ivar Bjørnson & R. Kronheim]

[English translation: ANSUZ ASTRAL]

[Lyrics: Ivar Bjørnson]

ANSUZ, ANSUZ!
The ship left for the sea
Never will she return
She is safe in the starry night

WUNJO, WUNJO!
The journey's been long
The dream comes to the sleeping
Brings him where he longs to dream

Further from thought,
free from the flesh
No answers, no circles
eternal birth, eternal death

"...I took and received
I fell, flew and walked
It was dark and I saw
Deep below, where silence roars..."

We wandered far and freely
The light came, and the sight faded
The houses are abandoned, and the sky is red
The ship is leaving for the sea.

5. Nidingaslakt
[Tekst: Grutle Kjellson]

Horna gjallar, vinden bles
Trommer dundrar, vinded bles
Med spjut og boge meter til strid
Me går i bresjen brødre gjennom blod.
Med von om ëre i galskapens namn
Me vert aldri slegn sjøl om me fell

Me reiser ei til Folkvang til,
vanedronnings famn, våre fedre skal
me møta om me fell i dag.
Me flytar ei frå var lagnad sjølv
om vinden ikkje bles vår vei.
Til valfaders hall brødre.

Med heva spjut i Odins namn.
Me skal heva krus i Odins namn
Nidingar skal falla for våre føtter.
Dei treng ikkje be om sollyse dagar.
Ingen hugsat ein trëll uten herre
Slegne vert dei når dei fell.

Me hevar våpen for vår tru
Me slaktar marken for vår tru
Ingen nåde me viser
for dei som snudde ryggen til.
Døy skal dei som freista
å mura brunnen inn.
ei som for med løgn og svik
Gje oss styrke, gje oss mot
Me skal sigra, brødre gjennom blod.

[Musikk: R. Kronheim]

[English translation: NIDINGASLAKT]

[Lyrics: Grutle Kjellson]

Horns are resounding, the winds are howling
Drums are pounding, the winds are howling
With spear and bow we go into battle
We are making a stand, brothers in blood
With hope for honour in the name of madness
We will never be defeated, even if we fall

We are not going to Folkvang,
Into the arms of the Vanir Queen,
We shall  our fathers if we fall today
We will not flee from our destiny,
even though the winds aren't blowing our way
Brothers, to Valfaders hall

With spear raised in the name of Oden
We shall raise mugs in the name of Oden
Cowards shall fall at our feet
They do not have to pray for sun filled days
No one remembers a slave without a master
Defeated they are when they fall

We raise weapons for our faith
We slaughter the fields for our faith
We have no mercy for those
Who turned their backs
Those who attemmp to close the well
Shall die
Those who lied and betrayed shall die
Give us strenght , give us courage
We will prevail
Brothers in blood

[Music: R. Kronheim]

6. Eit Auga Til Mimir
[Tekst: R. Kronheim, Grutle Kjellson, Dirge Rep]

Utgards mørke, langt der ute
Eg kjem ikkje inn, eit offer du krev?
Eit offfer eg krev, ingen lovnad eg gjen
Eg kan gje deg styrke, eg kan gje deg dauden
De seier du kan ta meg av dage.
Du seier du kan ta meg av dage.
Men utan meg er heller ikkje du
Skapar av svakhet, meg kan du ikkje truga.
Lær deg å sjå med det retta auga.
Du dunkle, du freistar å få meg i knt,
du taler i gåter, og får meg vred.
Med vrede, du veike, du ingenting får.
Din visdom eg krev for at du skal forstå
Du vil eg skal lida, og endå til dõy.
Du gløymer mi makt, at du er min trëll.
Ditt opphav du gløymer. Du prisar bedrag
Di verd er ei faginning, ingen heilhet, ingen svar
Orden eg skaper, men du motstrebar meg
Du talar med klõrt, kva er det du krev.
Eg krev eit offer, eg krev at du blør.
Du våga å trosse dei eldste, som bar deg fram

"Utgards mørke langt der ute, eit offer vart krevd,
eit offer dei fekk, Eit sinn vart styrka, men
lekam gjekk tapt, Klok vert den som veit å våga"

"Han ofra sitt auge, for at fjan skulle sjå
Han blødde for dei som til slutt lot han rå.
Men ingen lovnad ei ga ham, det vart ingen fred.
Dei skal fframleis kjempa, til jorda sig ned"

[Musikk: Grutle Kjellson]

[English translation: AN EYE FOR MIMIR]

[Lyrics: R. Kronheim, Grutle Kjellson, Dirge Rep]

The darkness of Utgard, far out there
I can not enter, are you demanding sacrifce ?
I demand a sacrifice, no promise I will give
I can provide you with strenght , I can give you death

You say you can end my days
But without my excistance , would you not be
Creator of weakness, me you can not threaten
Learn how to see with the right eye
Obscure One, you attemp to get me on my knees
You speak through riddles, and call forth my wrath
With wrath, weakling, nothing is achieved
I demand your wisdom, to make you understand
You want me to suffer, and even to die
You are forgetting my power, you are but my slave
Your source of origin you're forgetting, your praising deceit
Your world is an illusion; no wholeness, no answer
Order I crfeate, but your opposing me
Your speaking with a cunning tongue, what are your demands
I am demanding a sacrifice, I demand to see you bleed
You have dared to oppose the Ancient Ones that brought you into excistance


The darkness  of Utgard, a sacrifice was demanded, a sacrifice they received
A mind was strengthened, but the flesh was lost
He who dares becomes wise

"He gave his eye to see
He bled for those who let him rule at last
But no promises they gave him, no peace became
They shall still be fighting 'til the earth sinks"

[Music: Grutle Kjellson]

7. Blodhemn
[Tekst: Grutle Kjellson]

Du drap min son, fjemn eg svergar
Du øydela min veg, og fred med mitt folk
Du sverta mitt namn, dei trudde deg

D trudde min lagnad var spott og spe
Du trudde eg med mitt banesår døydde
Du trudde eg aldri skulle reisa meg

Du trudde lyset var din ven,
at du av dt var komen
Du trudde ale ville lystra ddeg
og gløyme valfaders gåver

Du gløymde din far sine vise ord
om svik, lagnad og død.
Du gløymde di plikt
som ein kjempande mann
og drap din bror i sveven.

Du trudde tid lækjar såê
ôå üøåå àùäë ûëãääó åøäïîó ùï èóþ
Âã ïäøymde meg og mi heilage plikt,
eg skal drepa eg i vrede.

Blodhemn eg svergar,
Blodhemn har eg alltid sverga.

[Musikk: Ivar Bjørnson & R. Kronheim]

[English translation: VENGEANCE IN BLOOD]

[Lyrics: Grutle Kjellson]

You killed my son, I am swearing revenge
You destroyd my path, and truce with my peaople
You blackended my name, they believed you

You saw my destiny as mockery
You was me dying with my fatal wound
You thought I would never rise

You thought the light was your friend,
That you sprung from it
You thought everyone would obey your words
And forget the gifts of Valfather.

You forgot your father's wise words
of betrayal, destiny and death
You forgot your duty as a man of strife,
and killed your brother sleeping

You thought time would heal the wounds,
that my people would forgive and pray
You forgot about me and my holy duty
I will kill you with anger

Vengeance in blood I swear
Vengeance in blood I have always sworn

[Music: Ivar Bjørnson, R. Kronheim]

8. Brisinghamen
[Tekst: Grutle Kjellson]

Einsam ho gret, den vakraste av alle
Fanga og låst i ei sorg ingen skjøner

Gleden forsvann langt, langt der ute.
Ei brennande lyst, en ingen håp.
Ho lengtar heim, men finn ingen veg.
Ein sorgfull lagnad gøymt bak eit smil.

Mardol du fagre for fred du blei ofra
Du solgte din lekam, men fann ingen trøyst.
Det som glimrar gjer ikkje fred for deg

Gern du ga deg hen, og slokka mangt
eit begjær. Men, framleis drypp
det om natta gull frå dine auge.

Frøya, od skal du finna når alt er forbi
då skal du bli sluppen fri.
Inntil den dag finn du inga trøyst.
Sjøl ikkje i glitrande Brisinghamen.

[Musikk: R. Kronheim & Ivar Bjørnson]

[English translation: BRISINGHAMEN]

[Lyrics: Grutle Kjellson]

In solitude she cries, the most beautiful of them all
Captured and locked in a sorrow no one can conceive
Joy vanished far out there
Burning desire, but no hope
She longs for home, bu tcan not find a way
A dismal destiny hidden behind a smile

Mardol, you glorious, sacrificed for peace you were
You sold your flesh, but found no comfort
That which glitters does not bring you peace

Gern you devoted yourself
and consumed many desire.
But, still in the night,
gold is dripping from your eyes.

Frõya, Od you shall find when everything ends
Then you shall be set free
Untill that day you shall find no comfort
Not even in the shining Brisinghamen

[music: R. Kronheim & Ivar Bjørnson]

9. Suttungs Mjød
[incl. Outro "Perkulator"]

[Tekst: Trad.]

[104]
Jotungubben eg fann
er no attende komen
der få ting eg teiande fekk
med mange ord
eg mykje til gagn
vann meg i Suttungs salar

[105]
Gunnlòd meg gav på gullstolen
drykk av den dyre mjød
vesal løn let eg ho få
ho gav meg trygt si tru,
ho gav meg heile sin hug

[106]
Rata-Tonni rudde meg veg
gardt grjot ho gnog
over og under var jotunvegar,
då gjekk det på livet laust

[107]
Det vene eg vann, eg vel hev n¢ti
lite den vise vantar
med di Odrere no opp er komen
midt i Midgards fjeim

[108]
Uvisst å vita om eg endå var
komen or Jotungarden ut, om ikkje
Gunnlòd, det gode kvendet, hadde
vorti min sële ven

[109]
Andre dagen av gjekk rimtussa
til å spørje råd av råd av Hår
i Håvahalli; etter Bolverk dei spurde,
om han var berga hjå gudom,
eller Suttung hadde slegi han ned

[110]
Ein eid då svor
Odin på ringen,
kven kan hans trygdemål tru?
Suttung han sveik for (skalde) drykken,
og Gunnlòd sårt han grøtte

[Musikk: Ivar Bjørnson & Grutle Kjellson]

ENSLAVED LYRICS


1. Convoys To Nothingness
Faces - eyes - noise

Floating patterns of no coherency, none needed

From behind the chapel of dreams came imagery
From another world
The left for a brighter star
A new home called "now"

Womb - death - dawn

Follow seafarers on an ocean of silence
Remaining humanoid shells, a distant thought
The chasm between truth and flesh paved
With bricks from secret cities

Entering linear orbit
Crushing the foundations of divided times
Suns reflected

Convoys...
Convoys to...
Convoys to nothingness...

2. The Voices
I hear their poisonous words again
As they call out for submission and code
"To be less than one and drown equals pride" they say
These were the voices that destroyed us

Did I want for this loss to be sustained?

Through the clipping of wings found the secret paths
From the blinding light of lies obtained second sight
Stabbed in the back, gained strength in One-ness
Taken from me, I learned to preserve

These were the voices that sunk our ships
These are the voices - poisoned ears bleeding

Did I pray for the dead to be kept awake?
Did I gently place these thorns through the surface
of my eyes?
Did I ask for this fathomless tragedy to go on forever?

Fail to comply - reborn in war
The answer being no

Did I?

3. Vision: Sphere Of The Elements (A Monument Part II)
Betrayed by disillusion
Enslaved by insanity
Enslaved by commitment to betrayal
Betrayed by all elements

My vision is clear and strong
I comfort myself to fulfil it
There exists no edge
Clearly existence is wrong

I kill myself to fulfil my vision
Consumed by astral interference
I deny this monument to be my sphere
I choke this ego to find that i'm dead
I deny this monument to be my sphere

I will die as one

4. Hollow Inside
Hollow inside - I didn't sleep too well last night
Step over, turn the light
Hollow inside - I didn't dream too much last night
Step over, turn the light

Knock on the door - these are the interfering themes
Open it up, too soon

Shorter in time - the interactive parts go by
I fear for a while - my head

I fear for a while - that my head will expand
And stretch out in to the stratos wild

Can't you see, those birds in limbo breaks
And of course you hear, listen, the straws
From above you, and underneath in the glow
I can touch them
Spiritualized

Dogs with bones, they are released
One too many to get on

5. The Cromlech Gate
[The fool:]
"Fear not dear kinsmen, cause you
Saviour I am. I'll bring back our glory
And wisdom Achieve I'm searching the
Old path to bring back the elder"

Smug as only the fool can be, mindless
Blindly. He marches towards his fate
Summoned by the Cromlech by hunger within

[Voice from a parallel existance:]
"Come inside my friend, your father is waiting.
Your search ends here, Wisdom you have
gained, the signs you have read."

Doomed to walk the smiths dungeons
Underworld slavery
Through the eyes of the fool nothing can be seen
The elder is hiding beyond thoughts
Only leaving with glimpses of long lost knowledge

I once saw the Cromlech and was kindly invited
But I stayed the beast I kissed the ground
(I drank the wine)
(I took up the runes)
I found the home of the elder

6. Enemy I
It was here I was born
While the stars held their breaths
After ages of pseudo-presence

I climbed the final steps
Up from deep beneath the shores
Eieth no longer sleeping gal

Thus alive and the stillness
Only to be broken by whispers
Towards the moon

Bloodred from the Unborn Ones cries
That will not be silenced or rest
Forever more and awaken not

To paint in blanks or wither
Beauty blinding no more
than the whole is less now

We see clearly what was not there
The prey become predator
Slaughtering not raging blindly

Through tunnels of sorrow and lust
For solitude and peace of mind
Says it is time to unmask and face

Behind lines  - that is Enemy I

7. Smirr
He sees his world through the crystal state of departure
The hooves echo the approach of the third coming
On it's back a goddess with shining black armour
The steel that will separate the will from doing
Closing in as he falls to his knees, surrounded by
Plasma of dying chapters
Life succumbs to silence, desire alone to the dying
Of inner banes
His hands no longer grasping contraction as he laughs

Winds play their mourners dirge through heaps of corpses
The hooves thundering the arrival of the final coming
Carrying forth the seeds of eternal night
So that the Shadow may sleep, eternity weeps
While we laugh and remain forever

She feels the cold floor giving no comfort as she fades 
The hooves echo the approach of the third coming
On it's back the faceless her Elder Ones saw
The agents of microcosmic change shattering the megalith
Stories told, divinity unfold
She passes on, yet remains in Smirr
Cold remains scattered in dead void dreams

8. The Sleep: Floating Diversity (A Monument Part III)
The battle's now past
The war of all was within itself

Painfully sleeping

All hail the fallen
The time is now for the king to tell

The battle's now past

All hail the fallen
Pleading diversity equals no scream
Thickening intensity now fatal
Beyond portrayed dream

The rooster fell dead in the dust
Before the break of dawn
But I knew time

The horse hung from worn out straps
With ungreatfulness
Wipped into his eyes
But I pulled the plow myself

The peasant laid himself down on the fields
Neither plenty nor free - but I cleared new land

Growths withered, eternal oaths shattered
Colours faded, hearts froze cold
The noise silenced, but mine was victory and might
Larger than time - heavier than night

Mountains fell, forestgreen to black
Time turned to silence, water to sand
The sun went cold, gone all but one light
Larger than time - heavier than night

Days ended, and the stars died
Before the wanderers reached home
But I knew the way

Ships sunk with all warriors and heralds
Laid to rest in bottomless pits
But I spotted new and unknown shores

The gods suddenly aged
When the golden walls fell
But I gave them new powers

Like an open wound
Who could endure
If i follow you, will i be like them
Standing tall, with the flag of the hanged ones

They were like the trees
Lifeless - did not speak
Did not move
Cold hand, empty eye (Mimir, do you hear this?)

It is a long journey, but are you growing tired?
Time stands still, everything else is dead
Blood and hymn
The god of corpses' sun
Shines in one and everyone's face

Urd answers in echoes, what will you do?
Where is your hammer
Thurisaz calls: smashed hold of illusion's roots

They were like trees
Lifeless
Did not feel, did not hear
Cold hand, empty eye
Ymir, do you hear this?

They were life trees
Lifeless
Ymir, why are you silent?

3. Entrance / Escape
I am not in there
I am not taking any part in this
There's no comfort where you are
And I won't give you anything

I am close to them mentally
But I am inbetween realities
There is no directions for where I am
They can't find me 'cause I am not in here

A troll screams with longing
Gods drown in fatal wounds
Tunnels of rot grows inside
Strong arms
The mountains will no longer be moved

Only the slave owns his own freedom
When kings follow the laws of christened men

Who will carry forth the silver
Who will guard the bow
Who will judge fairly
With hearts of coal

Worm with no skin
Who would want to
Enter such a world

The great men kill their children with blunt swords
Let them regret
Let them suffer
But give them no comfort

Never give them your hand
Never let them see the eye

Toothless bastards
Who wants to hear such words
The white christ kills his mother

Let them freeze, let them starve
But give them no comfort

If the few endures the journey
Then, we will build the wall
If the few endures the journey
Then we will build the wall
If the few endures the journey
Then we will build the wall

Seventy and thousand feet below
A pulse is beating more evenly
And higher
Waves expand like heartbeats
Through silent mosaic

A wise man
Three heights he was
Once came down here and said:
"What was, was never"

Then they saw the river
Burn, and the sun bled
Then they saw the river
Burn, and the sun bled

A norn
She came too
Down from the roots
And the tree of life
"Everything will die and decay
Silence will once again prevail"
Then they heard the song choking
And the children dying

Seventy and thousand feet below
A pulse is beating more
Evenly and higher
Empty universes in every world
Up there, where dreams die

[NIGHTMARE]

Fall in flames
Trapped under ice
Ridden by nightmares forever

The ending blue
Obscure and promising
In ancient red it orbits
That which once
white was black

Empires circles time
From other to one we go

Deceived to see eternity
If blinded
Silent nothingness
The mountains are moved
From the stars
And the fool
Sees nothing but stones

Empires circles time
From other to one we go

Moaning no one could
Stand listening to
Fills the inner worlds
Clutching the chains
That does not exist
Why not live
Without them?

Empires circles time
From other to one we go

The ending blue
Around a merciless mother
Who will caress us
With the burning skies
Of the last days

The herd ate it's shepherd
And starved to death, smiling
They didn't reach the meadows

You loved your neighbour
And ate your own mother
Losing your own war
Slave in your own chains

You look to the sun
And freeze to death
Torn apart in golden cages
Strangled by purity
Kissing the hand that killed your own brother

Be sure of this
I'll never turn my back to you
Be sure of this
I'll always mock you

Consider what you've created
When you're waiting for death
Listen, out there
Where our laugher is resounding
Think of what's waiting for you
You miserable fool!

We laughed as the hive burned

I went into battle
When the strangers came
I fought for my home and my herd
I struck them down
With my spear and bow
So that those at home could sleep and eat

I drank and yelled
I laughed and bragged
Of my victories, my courage and my strength
I told of the gold I found
At those I had slain before me

Suddenly I awoke
A cold and dark morning
With a dead herd and slaves escaped
All mead and all my friends were gone

That was when I went away to promising land
For once again to return with honour
Everyone that crossed my path
Was to feel my strength and wrath

By a flood stood an old and tired man
He guarded a boat which I needed
I charged to cut him down
But the sword broke
And the old one stood there grinning

"Poor fool, who never had seen
That a warrior shall fight against warrior
You'll never win if you're only looking ahead
And never inwards"
Suddenly the old one was gone
And the wind carried away the boat

By the shore I stood looking
But could not reach the other side
That's when the battle begun
Against the warrior I always thought I knew

I hail the living room with pride
Greeting me with flames and sea
...only he who dares is safe

Home - to a starworld of silver
Home - wolf, man and house

Kenaz - behind the eyes burns the
Light which we own
Raidho - on thoughts above
The sun and rain
Anzus - at the throne of our father
I laugh towards the holy wheel

She will provide us with answers
And the light
Then again we are swept in
Another darkness
...only he who asks becomes wise

Home - with stars of silver
Home - wolf, man and house
("I am - am I")

Warrior, never ask for peace
Husband, always long for home
Here we will be gathered
...if the rune is spinning

1. Intro: Green Reflection
[Instrumental]

2. Lunar Force
Farewell my brother
Farewell my foe
May death embrace you
Your blood in the darkness flow

You were never meant to rule
Never to light up my father's throne
May you suffer deep below
You tried to deprive (me of) my rightful crown

Fallen, defeated, tricked by Beorc,
The Lunar Force
Behold the sorcerer when you're
Impaled by the sword

Farewell my brother
Farewell my friend
May she have pity with you
We did not wish for your life to end

The day will bleak when
The Old One arrives
The King betrayed by his treacherous mind
Defeated by Beorc, The Lunar Force

3. Isa
Been standing here for ages
Watching the valleys blossom and burn
The pyres of yesterday smells of losing you
Preserved we are, portraits (in the glassy depths)
I picked up the shattered mirror, put them in water
Cold as my dreams

Isa: Still - Standing - Empowered
Isa: Watching you die, with tears of ice
Isa: Detached - Silent - Ecstasy
Isa: We are the dead

We arrived here from different spaces
Bidding the wooden shrines farewell
Concealed within dead lips lies the rope
That forged us and then tore us to shreds
Distant opposite assembly at the shores
They're telling me it's time to let go

A time to burn, a time to build
With your own hands a room within that room
Bring it all towards the centre and tremble
Bring her back from the shadows and kiss her
Retrieve the sword from the abyss
Hold back the tidal wave

Isa: Still - Standing - Empowered
Isa: Watching you die, with tears of ice
Isa: Detached - Silent - Ecstasy
Isa: We are the dead

4. Ascension
Staring across the void, seeing eye to eye in folded space
I see you with the colours and frenzy of the sacred rooms
We've met in those dreams; ice blue water ran towards the green sky
The gods spoke to us in their infancy
Suns waiting for us to smitten them with the flames of our disease
And we did so laughing, giving birth to sunrises in our wake

Never in need of sleep, nor in need of truth
I would never have stayed in this darkness, and we would ascend

The taste of ash, no stars above - No green grass below
The last words set ablaze as we saw the inner imagery
How it all came alive when we no longer reached for it
How it all rose and overwhelmed the speechless (us)

In this house without words we came to be one
In these books without text we found the way

A path along a faded memory, without the fear of finding home

We would never have stayed
We would never have stayed
We would never have stayed in this darkness
We would never have stayed
We would ascend

5. Bounded By Allegiance
Brought here by sorrow
Raised in the depths of fear

Consuming sanity
Feasting on the joy of Man

Surrounding the trembling mind
Surrounding the troubled soul
Strength failed to tame the serpent
The offspring of laughter and sadness
Saved by the power of its kin
Obeying the whispering chaos
Pulsating underneath your skin
Feasting 'till the end of time

Denying all peace within
Fearing the freedom it never feels

Bounded by allegiance
To long gone sanity

It lurks deep below

Emerge at the last step

6. Violet Dawning
I am a part of the darkness
Used to watch from afar
Sensing the violence of morning
And breathing... And waiting for nothing
Devouring the spirit, grinding the heart
There are good things in the burning fields
There's peace in the slaughtered flesh
There's life in the frozen seeds

I'll dream in the deserts
And comfort the thirst for seeing
The violet dawn in the distance
Beckons me to steal its light

I'll wait for you here

I'll wait for you here

I'll wait for you here

I'll wait for you here

7. Return To Yggdrasil
A new sound heard throughout the land
From which the spirits had left ages ago
Sacrifice and honour replaced by betrayal and usurpers
A trail of sweat and blood, a gathering to the pagan
outer worlds

For ages we have wandered
Under the wings of deception
Too long have we been waiting
For the long winter to end

An uprising by those that claim the Supremacy of One
Against the misleaders of the blind, deceivers of the Masses
Man can no longer claim ignorance as reason for waiting
It is all for the taking, the world for their making

We will gather again
Under the leaves
We will gather again
In honour of the nine nights

For ages we have wandered
Under the wings of deception
Too long have we been waiting
For the long winter to end

We will gather again
To praise the courage
We will gather again
To watch the harvest

8. Secrets Of The Flesh
[instrumental]

9. Neogenesis
Navigation by the fires of dead worlds
Towards the shores of Neogenesis

Navigation by the fires of dead worlds
Towards the shores of Neogenesis

Distant self now cut through, approaching infinitely
Racing hearts throbbing deep beneath the painted bones
Mars opens the hidden doors to Venus
Lunar flight crashing into solar storms
Blinding unification - vertigo - ecstatic curtain fall
Get ablaze by inner arson, endlessly reborn
Winds, oh the winds that speak of your salt and blood
Break open the dam, flood the deserts

Shocking white pulsar radiant dreams drawn in night sky
Ice-glazed branches undead by rays from an impossible sun
Crystallized pathways towards runic chambers concealed within the microcosmos
Revert away from the predicament, flee across the abyss

Severing the fetal cords spawning fusions by the thousands
Through bent space created black channel - pagan relay
Sensations of flesh flickering
Praising death through bleeding eyes

Neogenesis

1. As Fire Swept Clean The Earth
[Music: Ivar Peersen - Lyrics: Ivar Peersen, Kjetil Grutle]

I close my eyes
As Fire Swept Clean the Earth
Nothing left to strangle
As the cords were torn from our hearts

"Tired I blew out my last warning, the claws were ripping me apart"

As we emerged
From darker dungeons
Splendor of yellow hells
Expanded swollen eyes

No words were said
As Fire Swept Clean the Earth
Would the mothers be crying?
If they saw torches in our hands?

"The wind, once able to conquer, captured As Fire Swept Clean the Earth"

A kiss was placed
Upon my cheek
And all color came back
Melting in solid blue tune

2. The Dead Stare
[Music: Ivar Peersen - Lyrics: Ivar Peersen, Per Arild Husebr]

The Juggler stares
To quench the thirst
Upon the brow
Within the hand
It cracks and seeps
The seer weeps

In flickering light
The wounds are served
Screams from below
A shadow in chains
Feverish images told
In mirrors of old

The eyes they all share
In this tragic court
An empty seat
The river runs dry
Nothing said
Words in red

Behold the druid
As the stones fall
Known aloud turned
Backwards around
Reverse the loss
This never was

3. The Crossing
[Music: Ivar Peersen - Lyrics: Kjetil Grutle]

I no longer struggle
No longer see
Nothing remains, burning anxiety
Darkness came forth
Gave birth to me
Certain death is all I see

I see you weep
I see you suffer
I've seen kingdoms rise and fall
I've seen all that's supposed to be

Earthbound forces, united with sorrow
The path was given in ancient times
Embraced by hunger, forgotten by will
The wisdom is hold up still

Break the chains, come forth to see
Cross the abyss not meant to be
Cross the river, find the key
Kill the queen of anxiety

4. Queen Of Night
[Music: Ivar Peersen - Lyrics: Ivar Peersen]

Across the scorched fields of fathers land
In each step an abyss is built
Through misty dreams he touched her hand
The boar is dead

Its blood is spilt

He set his foot on the slopes of far away
They'd been asleep when his sun roared
He walked through night, walked through day

Landless mourning lord

"Why should we let you by?"

The road is blocked by men of three

"If you need ask, you already know"

They said to let him pass, to leave him be

At the shores of sorrow
How far he'd come (to see her eyes)
(After) Moons and more moons
He'd be there tomorrow

"And I would travel across the water
To where she lies"

On the sea of solitude he rows
The winds howl her name, he has no fears

Tired and smiling he falls, downwards he goes
There she is, waiting after all these years

I see a darkness overwhelming
I see that there is no light for me
I don't care if it leaves me blind
I don't care if I'm left behind

I see a white horse's head
I see it's dead stare fixed at me
I do not fear its eyes
Curse myself, return it twice

I see walls to high to climb
I see nothing on the other side
I should have roamed another space
I should have been another place

I am among ghosts when I should rest
I cannot tell the worlds apart
I do not heed the words they say
There is no dream of another day

I hear a silence, deafening
Drowning the deserts, that is my destiny
I no longer wish to see
The threads they've spun for me.

6. Ridicule Swarm
[Music: Ivar Peersen - Lyrics: Per Arild Husebr]

Pallid it hangs
In awe of amusement
Litany swarm
Bleak I say are the crutches of the assembly
And flies cling to it
More so ever the fingers to animate

Insubordinate, fickle exequies
Putrid core

Naudr........the ligature it can't break
Lagu...........the whispers it can't hear

Insubordinate, fickle exequies
Putrid core

7. A Darker Place
[Music: Ivar Peersen - Lyrics: Ivar Peersen]

Behind the walls
Below the lights

If you came upon a door
If you came to push it open
If your eyes could see within this dark
Your heart would flee
Nails and blood
Painted by delirium
You would feel the empty stare

From a darker place

Silent screams
From ages in the void
Desperation
The voices fill your ears
Head back into the light
Never to return
This dream will haunt you

From a darker place

Behind the walls
Below the lights

1. Entroper
I am the creator of true will

Long have I suffered
Long have I been forced
Blinded by their faith
Laughter resounds no more

I am the son of the ancient breed
I do not pity life
I follow not pathetic order
I am the realm of absurdity
Resistant to their conscience
Free of their constant pain
I was born in the flames

Long did they hope
That my logic would save them at last
Long did I know
That I would watch them die

While harvesting their fruits
Of their impotent threats
They forgot the potency
Of the old independency
Claiming my death would
Change the way of existence
Who, but me handled them?
The weapons of hope

They turned safely into non-existence

I will break the chains
I will slay the betrayers
One last time
The laughter shall resound

2. Path To Vanir
Awaiting my death, gasping for air
The relief emerge, the mistress so fair

Don't abandon me, please grant me life
I embrace your powers, higher wisdom's wife

I've been fighting in vain, but they grew too strong
For my kinsmen this day became far too long

I lie in the open, waiting to die
Were all my life's beauty built on a lie?

My grace you shall get, because I welcome your return
(If) you're not the hidden into sadness I'll turn
I've come to your rescue now before your last breath
My love you will receive, but it will be your death

Fear not, said the mistress, the lady of light
Those who betrayed us would not stand the fright

3. Fusion Of Sense And Earth
Cosmos trembled
When it came to be
Fusion of sense and earth

In awe they looked
Those who feared the dark
At the enemy of hate

All menaces vanished
Conquered by will to live
Marched towards the shores

A war against the abnormal
The obstacles of peace
Victory for the light

"Wisdom and Chaos must unite
The Storm Will Linger On"

When fighting blindfolded
Every beast was possible to slay
No fortress guarded

When the serpents
Spat at the surface of the earth
It howled and laughed

Armoured with good will
Certain of victory
It fell to the ground

"Wisdom and Chaos must unite
The Storm Will Linger On"

4. Ruun
Have you ever seen beyond the reach?
Have you ever felt the change?
Visions from an altered state
They conceal and relevate

Communing once again with Gods
Thread unto the impossible path
Talking with a different tongue
Heralding the unsung

Reach for them, see them turn away

Have you ever seen beyond the reach?
Have you ever felt the change?
Visions from an altered state
They conceal and relevate
Fly away, chains undone

Reach for them, see them turn away

Doors open wide
Step into the light
No turning back
Embrace the night
Breathe eternities
We are not alone
Never to return
Merge with the unknown

5. Tides Of Chaos
I've got this twisted core
I've got this noose around my neck
That (just) won't let go
I've got this dream
In Which I kill you all
And there is no going back
They've choked the good in me
Sent me off to wander alone
Hateful, starving enemy of (your) order
Hunt you down, make you understand
No compassion for the enslavers of will
Your spite for reason makes me strong
Your lack of direction showed me where to go
We've come to share this destiny
No borders, no landmarks
Out in the open
I hold the key to the door
In vivid dreams while awake
I saw a way through
The agony of choice

In a Universe where the storms rage Endlessly
Time will never come to reinstate me
Mine is none

There was a day when I knew silence
Then came the tides of chaos
Washed it all away
I have seen what you have become
Smiling with evil intent
Betrayal between the lines
I have stepped outside the circle
Better off without
Choking on sand and sorrow
Visions from the suffocated

In this Universe where the fire roars Endlessly
Peace will never come to reconstruct me
Mine is gone

6. Essence
The question is this
By will alone
Does my heart carry the strength
To see you burn?
When I do not wish to part
To see them farewell
Does my heart carry the strength
To leave you behind?

The eternal search for purity
A fragile hope for the just and fair
Order feeds from the corpses
All beauty must die

Where is the essence
In beast or scripture?
Where lies the laws
In stars or temples?
I cannot see myself
Not your orbit
I cannot see the others
Not your eyes

It lasts forever when you let it go
Purity and Pain

Where is the essence
In beast or scripture?
Where lies the laws
In stars or temples?
I cannot see myself
Not your orbit
I cannot see the others
Not your eyes

If I told you I'd get you through
I'd have to let you fall down

Not because of malice
You needed to
And I'll remember
What we had

It lasts forever when you let it go
Purity and Pain

7. Api-vat
You lie there sleeping
Growing in my mind
A voice from eternity
Awaken now and guide me

Awaken now and guide me
Awaken now and guide me

He turns inward to see
"What might lie ahead?"
Seeing all, but nowhere
"Tell us, will we see the sun again?"

"Waiting is the cost of true vengeance"

Carrying the weight of knowing
"I see darkness, I see evil times"
Time to rise and stand tall again
"The ideals of the One"
I bow to the forefathers
"Towards the Father"
Feeling the transition
"The unity of dimensions"

Leave me not before all fear is gone
Pour into my veins
Let the father become the son,
And I'll keep walking through every winter

I'll keep on walking through every winter
I'll keep on walking through every winter

8. Heir To The Cosmic Seed
Behold the great evening star
As she once again gives birth
Behold the great evening star
As she once again destroys

Behold the shining wife
Of all the howling winds
She arrives when you despair
Behold the shining wife

Beware of what the self desires
She could smile if she removed
All glory from kings

Beware of the heir of cosmic fertility
Her splendour can cut you deep
Her eyes can burn the fields.

1. Ethica Odini
Reckless man - So righteous, so clean
Towards the light - So bashful, so pure

Who told you to abandon life
Your strength, free will
And bow for the light?
The light! And turn from the spinning wheel

Fear of the judgement!
Obey!

[Ref:]
You have the key to mystery
Pick up the runes; unveil and see
Judgement comes, before us lie
The paths of war and you may die
You have the key, cross over and see
The old and wind-cold tree
Walk the steps and you'll hear the winds that cry

Search beyond the blinded eyes
Listen before you preach
Don't leave yourself behind

Honorlife, when life has ceased
Welcome the dawn

Beware the glory tales

Watch their deeds - So just and fair
Crusaders - Appointed by God

Who told you step inside and preach?
Did you forget the daggers lurking in the dark?
Couldn't you listen or didn't you ever learn how?
Were you saved?
Were you saved, so you could slaughter with grace?

[Ref:]
You have the key to mystery
Pick up the runes; unveil and see
Judgement comes, before us lie
The paths of war and you may die
You have the key, cross over and see
The old and wind-cold tree
Walk the steps and you'll hear the winds that cry

Search beyond the blinded eyes
Listen before you preach
Don't leave yourself behind

Honorlife, when life has ceased
Welcome the dawn

Beware the glory tales

Hold on, don't fade away
Don't be afraid to bleed
Don't be afraid to dream

Let the elders enlighten the path
They have cried for you
They have died for you

Drasill - Ride on
Drasill - Ride on
Ride on
Drasill

2. Raidho
This journey without movement
Heading out for no-man's land
The way ahead my only ally
Early hours, in the silence

This credence keeps me upright
Through the storms and disasters
A straight line towards the unknown end
Deceit waits on the back roads

This unwavering inner
Keeps fear a welcomed pointer
I, uprooted, now the fertile soil
As plot and shadows thicken

This juggernaut cannot be stopped
On any scale or planet
Ghostly tracks in my wake and ahead
An experience, cannot be shared

[Ref:]
Wheels of time
Keep them turning
Carriage of concepts
Circling the planes

Lightless voyage, blinding speeds
Certain; I'll stay the distance
Abstract shapes, enigmatic design
I know enough to endure

Lightless corridors, ageless
Familiar
Alien
Contradictory engines run high
Deeper and further above

Journey of no promises
Beyond the lust for rewards
Focus on the movement of the Wheel
Union of stillness and change

Journey of the ages all
I'll follow outside the edge
Breath, blood, sacrifice and bleeding eyes
Unending journey ahead

[Ref:]
Wheels of time
Keep them turning
Carriage of concepts
Circling the planes

3. Waruun
See them as they rise
From ancient sands - constructs
They're reaching everywhere and nowhere
As they're trampling on the archetypes
The listener warns

Tension... Pain... Fear... Violence

It reaches the limit set by
Ageless reason
Tension paints logic's hunts
Pain dances... (with justice)

Lies for the liar served without remorse
Like the gifts bring gifts
Altering view

Constant truth - drained of spirit
By own will

[Ref:]
Waruun
Waruun - Drawn in the dust of morning
Waruun - The violence of the soul

Suicides upon the altars
Of evasion

Feared dissonance kept away - nails on stone
As darkness descends
Can't find our way out of here
Yet... It was built by you
Words on the trap-door

[Ref.:]
Waruun
Waruun - Drawn in the dust of morning
Waruun - The violence of the soul

Tension... Pain... Fear... Violence

How could freedom become the cage-maker?
What spoke to the mind-slayer?

4. The Beacon
To war!
Let the havoc be revenged

March!

Against the lords of perdition

Live!
Breathe!

Persecute the ones that left to persecute your soul
Crush the scepters of the kings and come and
Hail the vows of old!

[Ref:]
Hear them cry
Watch them fly
Let them bow to the altars of suppression
Till you'll feel them die

Hear them cry
Watch them fly
The power and the free will they deny

Beyond the mist
Far above
On the highest peak
The beacon is lit
On the highest peak
The beacon will burn

How did I get this far?
How did it come to this?
Was my blood spilt in vain?
Did I survive, did I break the chains?
Was I ever alive?

Struggle through the wounds
Struggle through the fears
Struggle through the truths
You stand alone

Come through!
Release me!

[Ref:]
Hear them cry
Watch them fly
Let them bow to the altars of suppression
Till you'll feel them die

Hear them cry
Watch them fly
The power and the free will they deny

Beyond the mist
Far above
On the highest peak
The beacon is lit
On the highest peak
The beacon will burn

I walked this far myself
My blood dripped from my knife
I awoke, and was alive
I did no longer weep
I saw my beacon, I ran to aid

5. Axioma
"Mind not the worshippers of punishment,
Un-growers and resisters"

Close your eyes, sense the below
Torment and separation points ahead
Set ablaze like steel through skin

"Fear not the settlement with those who fear the truth"

Leave now, bid farewell with no grief
Their words have no power
The forces will roam and return

6. Giants
No distance, no time
Endless void, absence of life
Chaos dwells outside the womb
Seduce, Invoke
Embrace, Give birth

See through the flesh
See past the soul
Feel the pulsating twilight
Domain of unborn thoughts
Go back, Unveil
Approach the cosmic womb

No smile without pain
No grief without laughter

[Ref.:]
Turn inwards, Realize
Witness the march of the Giants
-Soil and seed
Turn inwards, Gratify
Witness the storming of heaven
-Endless rebirth

Come nearer, Restless sin
Step into the core
They will welcome your return
Further in
Ride the storm one can't escape

Awake the Gods
Awake the Gods

[Ref.:]
Turn inwards, Realize
Witness the march of the Giants
-Soil and seed
Turn inwards, Gratify
Witness the storming of heaven
-Endless rebirth

7. Singular
Born into oblivion
Without the fear
-of existing all alone

Later comes the acquisition - forced upon
The solitude
Now loneliness
The god now submerged in a game of guilt

Psychopathic shepherds deny the miracle
-of our essence
...And yet we have part in the blame

Allowing their ravings,
Comforting their weakness, their sickness
It is time to
LIVE
TRUST
NO
ONE

Recognize black
Recognize white
Recognize shadows
I am with gods

...Black...White...Shadows...Gods

Recognize black
Recognize white
Recognize shadows
I am with gods

Traitors want to keep you down
Rise up from the ground

No-one steals what no-one owns
Disown and distance

Strong is she who realizes
Ethics built on sacrifice

No-one steals what no-one owns

One by one by one

Strong is she who realizes
Ethics built on sacrifice

No need for companionship
Back into the silence
It is all it needs
Desolation

Singular - Death - Birth
Singular - Birth - Death

Alone in birth
Alone in the darkness
Alone in death
Alone in the daylight

One with reality
Shaped by the inner glow
Determination - I
All can be reached from within

Born into oblivion
Without the fear
-of existing all alone

Later comes the acquisition - forced upon
The solitude
Now loneliness
The god now submerged in a game of guilt

Psychopathic shepherds deny the miracle
-of our essence
...And yet we have part in the blame

Allowing their ravings,
Comforting their weakness, their sickness
It is time to
LIVE
TRUST
NO
ONE

Recognize black
Recognize white
Recognize shadows
I am with gods

8. Night-sight
I can see through the veil
Seeing all I need see
Nothing is hidden here
Deep into the woods

Casting
Letters that speak of...
All
Is all
Is naught

No-one but me
Knows of this place
Sanctuary
Where I construct

Dream while there is no strife
Anguish pulls no weight
One can see and the other is blind
Through the same pair of eyes

We have lost sight
Of the night-side of the self
Hunted by the fear
Of reunion
Night-sight is bliss
For he who dares look into
A world where you embrace the opposite
Where you are whole

There is no lasting joy
In numbness and dogma
Too much is too little in knowledge
Driven by mystery

We have lost sight
Of the night-side of the self
Hunted by the fear
Of reunion
Night-sight is bliss
For he who dares look into
A world where you embrace the opposite
Where you are whole

9. Lightening
I crossed the borders
The pain won't go away

For this treason, I want to see them ... Burn!
Hunt them down
Make them understand
The power I possess

I'll give you piece of mind
And freedom to search inside

I'll suffer for your souls

I cleaned the air
I slew death in your way
The hand of peace
All evil's great dismay

Hear the wheels turn
See the sky burns

For this treason, I want to see them... Burn!
Track them down
Bring them to silence
My will is the law

I'll bring you life and growth
And erase the memories of despair

I'll suffer for your needs

Don't you forget where your domain lies
Obey your slaves, with their feeble cries
We'll force you back if you linger here
We mock your strength, we see your fear
You'll never set a slave's mind free
Your bane is the grip of anxiety

At the ninth...

REID - Travel with no fear
REID - Remember to return
REID - Defy the laughing chaos
REID - Strike again

You fight the wars for your kin
You leave yourself behind
This settlement, you can't win
The inner eye is blind

I will clean the air
I know the pain will stay
I'll cross the border
I'll never fade away

For this treason, I want to see them... Burn!
Track them down
Bring them to silence
My will is the law

I'll bring you life and growth
And erase the memories of despair

I will linger on

1. Clouds
In the void of chaos life endures
In the gap of creation, the ancient wisdom breathes

Inheritance of fire
Inheritance of frost
Yet it lay there weeping
Afraid to see the light

Inheritance of fire
Inheritance of frost
No one comes to unveil
No one finds the key

Inheritance of fire
Inheritance of frost
Grasp the mighty chaos
Grasp the ancient birth

Seek deep within, feel the flames
Into the void, never to return
Seek deep within, fertilize
Into the void, rise...

Struggling against the fumes
Poisoning the hearts
Fighting the chains, to penetrate the clouds
Pulsating life in the ancient womb
Encapsulated in forces of old

Waiting to hear the call
To witness the cosmic marriage
Willing to blow; to blow the mocking clouds away

2. To The Coast
To the coast, but not across
Static sanctuary

Longing for the heart of the changer
Chained to the past, a dream of liberation
The vultures above, they know, they've seen him linger here
Where the barren land meets sea; the mother and the reaper
The irony of...
Sorrow kept close
Hanging head
Gaze upon the waters and turn back again
Like so many times before

Riders on the horizon with darkness in tow

Too painful to let go of the fear, too strong the ties
He came without a face
...And a promise of belonging
So I caved and gave way to this vision
Bleak and never-ending the pages
I'd like to see what lies beyond
Dissolving ink in salt water
Wrecked and laughing at the skies and the open sea

To the coast but not across
Had some strange days then walked back
To the coast but not across

Longing for the heart of the changer
Chained to the past, a dream of liberation
The vultures above, they know, they've seen him linger here
Where the barren land meets the sea; the mother and the reaper
The irony of...

Riders on the horizon with darkness in tow

Too painful to let go of the fear, too strong the ties
He came without a face
...And a promise of belonging
So I caved and gave way to this vision
Bleak and never-ending the pages
I'd like to see what lies beyond
Dissolving ink in salt water
Wrecked and laughing at the skies and the open sea

Black clad back into the all over again

3. Ground
The defining sound

Fangs into flesh
Panic and spit
Death unto life
Eyes wide

It sees itself through the layers of ice
Now; seal the cracks ... reject the notions!
Everything can not be happening on the inside?

An option not to listen

A nameless urge takes hold
Prey upon the weak
An aimless tale told
Pray upon the weak

Caught in a spiral of need
Act without the choice
Choose not to act
Caught in a spiral of need

Desperate and alone in a whole
Striving for higher ground
Carrying someone else's fears for tomorrow
Stay behind the line
Or eat from the bowels of reality
Grind the thorns to stardust
Gliding slowly across the abyss
Inside the inside the inside

There is a sound made by boiling blood

Above and below lay the levels
Above and below the ground
Ground

4. Vertebrae
"Abandoning the powers that gave them sight
Summoned to the altars of their loving gods"

Storming the walls, once built with pride
Swarming like rats away from the lights
Howling for justice, death in their eyes
Tearing down the pillars with monstrous hate

Forging the swords to slay their own kin
Screaming in triumph, burning inside

When the steps are fulfilled
We shall see a new dawn
When the dead world is gone
We shall rebuild the walls

When all the bricks from the morning
When they are once again found
We will emerge from the ashes
And rise from the ground

5. New Dawn
In the radiant night
Beneath the fertile soil
In every heart it lies sleeping
Hiding in dreams of strength
Older than the mountains
So ancient and profound
Beyond the grasp of reason
Above the laws of man

The ancient gods of battle
Summoned by the drums of war
In circles of fire descended
Our eyes and minds frantic
At the point of no return
I never saw her shine so bright
Returning the strength to a weary heart
Strife to reclaim and expand

A new dawn rises
Out from the shadows
A new dawn rises
I step unto the world

In times when truth has lost its valour
In times when fate is bought and sold
When honour lays slain at vanity's feet
It seemed like our last hour had come
The enemies' name outspoken
They will tremble upon seeing the sign
The second coming has no mercy
Forged in the flames with iron will

A new dawn rises
Out from the shadows
A new dawn rises
I step unto the world

6. Reflection
Clinging to life in the reflection of the self
Breathing the air from the poisoned pit
Hovering through flames from the burning core

Searching for reason in the ashes of men
Obeying the laws of the kings without lands
Bowing in awe at the hypocrite's feet
Not hearing the cry of the infant

Poisoning the seed that was planted within
Ignoring the winter that closes in
Believing the tales from the forked tongue
Frozen to death without being born

Looking for reason in the bottomless abyss

Clinging to life in the reflection of the self
Breathing the air from the poisoned pit
Hovering through flames from the burning core

Searching for reason in the ashes of men
Obeying the laws of the kings without lands
Bowing in awe at the hypocrite's feet

Clinging to life
Frozen to death

Clinging to life in the reflection of the self
Frozen to death without being born

Absorbing the reek of rotting Flesh
Marching in convoys to fields unknown

Clinging to life in the reflection of the self
Embracing the sun without casting shadows

Believing the tales from the forked tongue
Frozen to death without being born.

7. Center
Feel nothing
Oxen and primate as one
Pushing what already strives
(There is) no space
(There is) no peace
Let go of the whip

We've reached the outer limits of this orchestrated vision
Some might think it can't be kept apart
Forgot to ask: where are we in all of this?
Trying to get off track ... Into the wilderness
Running from the beast

In need of strength, in search of guidance
Asked but given nothing - remembering everything
It matters not now, it all came to fuel
Silent growth
Hoarse rust
Can not be broken
I trust the shapes
Heathen vertigo
Repaint the curses and bellow
Sailing past to old shores
In the distant haze

The waving motion
Is not for you

In every direction stretched and torn no more
(It) seems we've been here all along

8. The Watcher
Darkness...
Fear...
Life...
Cold...

Left alone with no will
Walking in footsteps of the fallen
Blinded by lack of reason
Indulging the tales of doom

...Farewell,
May the darkness bind them
No one will
Remember the pain when we are...

Desolate...
Unconscious...
Lost...

Where lays the ones I've slain?
Did I become any wiser?
Will their anger hunt me down?
Did I sacrifice in vain?

...Farewell,
Hear the sound of solitude
No one will
Walk the bridge, to darkness overcome

Settlement...
Trust...
Relief...
Dawn...

Guide me, watcher in the skies
Transform the forces of the dead
In my dreams I'll hunt them down
I now know the truth

1. Disintegrator
Separate
The frenzied infant
From mother
Her bosom bleeding
She needs sleep

Separate
The frenzied infant
From his mother
Her bosom bleeding
She needs sleep

Take him to the woods
Leave him there
The dogs will feast
The dogs will know him

Disintegrate
Disintegrate
Disintegrate
Disintegrate

2. Striker
From soar to plague
From clouds to imprisonment
From wheat to the gallows
In dreams of free will
Strike

Never saw fields
Quite like these
Never will Never would
With open eyes
Shut

Useless wreckage
In the wake
Cannot hear the chatter
Cannot bear the drag
Leave

When they saw
With what they were left
They screamed in fear
They screamed for blood
Endure

Should I build
I will build my own
Knife and noose
In flesh and will
Strike

1. Thoughts Like Hammers
Celestial buried mind resting
Resting without peace still
Don't know where I drowned

Cornered and defeated
Yes, there's a thought forming
Patterns in the currents
Mud-dwellers at the star-floor

Nourishment for the mind seeps
Harvest through suffering
Absorbed in desperation

Assimilated logic
Drawn towards the ladders
Elucidated, burned, afraid
Instinctive destruction sparked
Elucidated, burned, afraid
Knowing only my own dissent
Elucidated, burned, afraid
Static is the common language
Elucidated, burned, afraid

Celestial buried mind resting
Resting without peace still

Assimilated logic
Drawn towards the ladders
Elucidated, burned, afraid
Instinctive destruction sparked
Elucidated, burned, afraid
Knowing only my own dissent
Elucidated, burned, afraid
Static is the common language
Elucidated, burned, afraid

Motion remains our mothertongue
Failure might not be what it seems
All is broken for a reason
Familiar blood drawn for painting
Willing another perspective
Flashing scenes seeing children above

Knowing there will be another life
Sacrificing
Sacrificing remnants of the past
Walking all on my own forever
The illusion no longer needed

It is spoken without words of doubt
Now we move the stars above, below

And dwell beneath the layers of dirt
My runic patterns in the current

My runic patterns in the current

Motion remains our mothertongue
Failure might not be what it seems
All is broken for a reason
Familiar blood drawn for painting
Willing another perspective
Flashing scenes seeing children above

2. Death In The Eyes Of Dawn
The creation I can't remember
Unsecure I roam in fear
The final steps I've taken
What waits beyond this void?

"I sucked out your lifeblood
Tore down your fortress
Burned down the woods
I poisoned your harvest"

Trust and hope
I have lost
I see death
In the eyes of dawn
Deceit
Forged in the darkened depths of the womb
Seeds of betrayal planted in rotten soil

The ground swells
It's the end
I see the face
Of the dead god
Legions of the dead
Invading our realm
Forever deaf to the distant warning

Blinded are my eyes
Tied are my hands
Sleeping wide awake
Got lost within myself

I followed all the paths
Rigtheous in my heart
Slept without the dreams
Got lost within myself

When will I remember?
When will I hear the call?
When shall my forces gather?
When shall my battle begin?

"I've insulted your life since birth
You have never seen my true face
You failed to realize I'm your kin
I infected your mind when you smiled"

Awake!

The grip of anxiety
Shall strangle the brave no more

The son of earth and wind
Shall guide us in our wake

"You might hear the horn resound
You might summon back your king
As long as you love, I will hate
As long as you breed, I will kill"

Blinded are my eyes
Tied are my hands
Sleeping wide awake
Got lost within myself

I followed all the paths
Rigtheous in my heart
Slept without the dreams
Got lost within myself

3. Veilburner
Finding the truth doesn’t mean there’s an answer
Who would have thought? It seems worthless.
There’s no end to the travesty, idiocy,
It would seem I’ve arrived at the meeting point
Between then and now, a different place
The past alive, and the future is now

I can not tolerate being held in the dark
I need to see, I will the flames
Expanding light, from within a cube of darkness
I need to see, I will the flames
I found myself crawling, looking for an “out”
And made the gap no longer closed anymore
’cause my signs are burning, burning the veil
Killing our idols, scaring ourselves as well
Necessity, carer/killer
We’re all gonna see, we weren’t prepared

I can not tolerate being held in the dark
I need to see, I will the flames
Expanding light, from within a cube of darkness
I need to see, I will the flames
I found myself crawling, looking for an “out”
And made the gap no longer closed anymore
’cause my signs are burning, burning the veil
Killing our idols, scaring ourselves as well
Necessity, carer/killer
We’re all gonna see, we weren’t prepared

Grasping the liquid glass
Shaping my own sight
Staring at the sun
Absorbing death
Reach into the well
Where father laid his eye

4. Roots Of The Mountain
Approaching life
From the seeds of time
Cosmic pulse
Aeons of chaos

Feel the flames, the streams of life below
Feel the flames, that blind your inner eye
Seek and find, what lingers deep inside
Seek and find, but do not try to understand
Spread the wings, and fly into your mind
Spread the wings, and find the eagle in the sky
Find the source, the ancient passion play
Find the source, the roots of the mountain

Hark, men of faith
Where were you
When your children bled to death?
Listen, men of law
Where were you when the mothers were slain?

Feel the flames, the streams of life below
Feel the flames, that blind your inner eye
Seek and find, what lingers deep inside
Seek and find, but do not try to understand

Hark, men of faith
When you set fire to the fields,
The grass grew stronger
Listen, men of law
When you turned from life,
The flames endured
Leave order, the fiend of the earth
The self is all you've got
Enter life on the waves from the void
Behold the ancient roots
And the battles shall forever go on
With peace comes our certain doom
The mother will love as she hates
Where there is life, you will die

Approaching life
Aeons of chaos
Feel the flames, the streams of life below
Feel the flames, that blind your inner eye
Seek and find, what lingers deep inside
Seek and find, but do not try to understand
Spread the wings, and fly into your mind
Spread the wings, and find the eagle in the sky
Find the source, the ancient passion play
Find the source, the roots of the mountain

5. RIITIIR
Your arms, life and death
Ride the chariot, the wheel of life
Underneath the eyes we pray

Seven horses running in circles until the end of days
Above the wonders of man, sailing the cosmic seas
Risen from the darkness to rule the ancient world
Never to return, the eyes will forever shine on

Omniscient, glorious - the all seeing eye
Malign, burning grace
All rise! The seeds you will bring
Sons of man, bow in awe

Omnipotent, Lumina Titan
In the havens you greeted us
Late is the hour you submerge
Endless travel towards the dawn

Hail the flames inside you, cosmic flowers in bloom
Hail the spears impaling, the servants of doom
Given are the truths, together we shall search
Unveiling the riddles, hidden beneath the stones

Left is an ancient entity
Ready to sacrifice, what we may (have) achieved
Ending a journey with no end

Defying the ones drowned in salvation
Letting the forces roam free
A circle fulfilled

6. Materal
See her cruel beauty
Hostile to the constants
Ever changing scourge
Ashen thrones
Converge upon me
Come winds of destruction
Electrocute the stale
Purify

Thaw! False ice to water
Speak! Sharp tongues sever sick limbs
Numb! Do not look away
Opt! Permanent particles

Curtains be unshut
Old wounds opened and bled
Wishes laid to rest
Ashen hopes
Reflections of truth
Drops of eternity
Instances captured
Clarify

Etch! New shapes will emerge
Need! Reaching into the dark
Owe! I opened the gates
Roar! O', devourer of time

There's this chamber
Randomly placed in time and space
Echo chamber
Achievable dream
Capacitate
Heuristic observers might find
Ends to the means
Rain is less scarce there

You heeded my call - now read my signs
And chose to follow
Dominate slavelessly
Enter my thoughts,
And walk with me throughout these barren lands
Aligning wordlessly
Tell me my own story,
Through the inner and nether worlds
Healing accordingly
Into the night side, irreversible and remorseless
Slaughterous and reborn
Hagalaz!

End the charade!
Return to the wombs
A funeral lost
Baptize the faceless
Light up the beacons
End the hunt for truth!
Time to break it down
Owe nothing to trees
Nullify the past

Enter the maternal fires
Entropy
Deter rot within the roots
Nourisher
Old fears no longer controls
Negation
Enter maternal fires
Xiphoid dreams

I close the gate!
Silence the voices
Take to heart the fear
And nourish the pain
Nothing can hurt us
Called upon the mare
Ended the sham reign
These forces in tow
Endlessness opens

Ashen memories
Retain the images
In need of her strength
Time changes
Death is encountered
Over and over again
Worship her pyres
Navigate

7. Storm Of Memories
In the land described as the beyond
In lack of better directional insight
Something stirs and leaps
Casual roads of reason intersect
Conceptual wormholes in the lawless black
In ancient matter

Unknown kin, as they thoroughfare
Unexplored utopia lineage
Accumulation
Icebergs of the abyss never melts
Ideal energy, it's building within
Unlike loyalty

Cadaverous and spirited; I work
Composite and uniform; I sacrifice
Resist the wisdom
With limited perception we see
We learn, and we laugh, and we sleep,
And we watch
Logic is worthless

Storm of the ions, ecstatic mind
Seeps through the cracks, it fills up the bones
I remember now
The here and the now - it is nothing
...This Eve - haunted by a storm of memories
Immortality

Then it was quiet, then it was dark
Trees, dreams, and the runes
Makes for a future
I'm on the inside
Looking at the sky, I think of you
Life is a room, in between the greater halls
There we'll met again

I can't make out what is what is what
In this storm of memories
Now it all comes back
I know there's strength in my blood
I can hear the past
Fearing not
Time has come... listen
There's a storm
Within
Storm of the ions, ecstatic mind
Seeps through the cracks, it fills up the bones
I remember now
The here and the now - it is nothing
...This Eve - haunted by a storm of memories
Immortality

Then it was quiet, then it was dark
Trees, dreams, and the runes
Makes for a future
I'm on the inside
Looking at the sky, I think of you
Life is a room, in between the greater halls
There we'll met again

Unknown kin, as they thoroughfare
Unexplored utopia lineage
Accumulation
Icebergs of the abyss never melts
Ideal energy, it's building within
Unlike loyalty

Cadaverous and spirited; I work
Composite and uniform; I sacrifice
Resist the wisdom
With limited perception we see
We learn, and we laugh, and we sleep,
And we watch
Logic is worthless

8. Forsaken
Forsaken
Entombed in monumental self-moral
Embracing the absurd
Reason turned to abstraction
Drowned in the shallowest of waters

Forgotten the will
To learn
Abandoned every urge to
Create
Every border can be breached
By the glorious armies of united perfection

Marching forth
Aiming low
A thirst to kill
Defending the nothingness

Forsaken
The unborn learns to hate
Navigation towards destruction
Letting our ideals slowly rot

And thus...
Thus we choose
To die...
Die with pride
And innocence...

We became the heralds
Born and raised to preach
And to erase all traces
Of the abstract and evil

Swords...
Temples...
Fires...
Doom...
We failed to see what we fed
The serpent of the deeps
It grew and strangled the truths
We were embracing the lies
We once could see its eyes
The stare of death and deceit
We feared not, the secrets we knew
The guardian of the deeps

Lost...
And the darkness will prevail
Forever...
Folding hands with clouded sight
Ceremonial rituals will obscure the mind
Forever...

Lost...
And turning blossom to decay
Forever...
Fighting wars with clouded sight
Ceremonial rituals will obscure the mind
Forever...

1. One Thousand Years of Rain
[performed by Enslaved]The age of the wolf is the age of the sword

Son of the earth, father of despair, lurking
And ever searching to end his thirst
Strength reborn in the streams of cold blood
Son of the earth, father of rage, hiding beneath
And ever smiling when the seed is planted
Hate paving the streets of gold

Long gone is the golden grace
Feeble beats from a frozen heart
Now glowing eyes in the pale face
The blind man cries in vain
Long gone is the light of day
Searching the borders of sanity
The children of tomorrow they slay
Their spirits entombed in rotten soil

Son of the earth, father of anxiety, amongst us
And ever telling the tales of the righteous
Licking drops of sorrow from the lake of tears
Son of the earth, father of treason, envy the beauty
And ever embracing the desperation
Hiding from the moonbeams, afraid to face the wrath
Wandering down the icy path
The sun is dying
The mother is crying
No sadness found in the jester’s face
The sun is dying
The mother is crying

Long gone is the golden grace
Feeble beats from a frozen heart
Now glowing eyes in the pale face
The blind man cries in vain
Long gone is the light of day
Searching the borders of sanity
The children of tomorrow they slay
Their spirits entombed in rotten soil

The winter is closing in
Like the grip of a war within
Absence of light turning flesh to stone
A cosmic war and you stand alone

Brother killing brother
Tales of honor becoming myth
History written with axes and blood
The wolf is howling at the gate

Bræðr munu berjask
(Ok at) bönum verðask,
Munu systrungar
Sifjum spilla
Leika Míms synir
(En) mjötuðr kyndisk
At inu galla Gjallarhorni

Skelfr Yggdrasils
Askr standandi
Ymr it aldna tré
Hræðask allir
(Á helvegum)
(Áðr Surtar þann
Sefi of gleypir

Wandering down the icy path
The sun is dying
Silent tears won’t bring him back
No sadness found in the jester’s face
The mother is crying
Breach the walls, relieve the pain, or be left in one thousand years of rain

2. Ægirs armar
[performed by Enslaved]
3. Immigrant Song
[performed by Enslaved]
[originally by Led Zeppelin]Ahhh-ah-ah! Ahhh-ah-ah!

We come from the land of the ice and snow
From the midnight sun where the hot springs blow
Hammer of the gods will drive our ships to new lands
To fight the horde and sing and cry
Valhalla, I am coming

On we sweep with the threshing oar
Our only goal will be the western shore

Ahhh-ah-ah! Ahhh-ah-ah!

We come from the land of the ice and snow
From the midnight sun where the hot springs blow
How soft your fields so green can whisper tales of gore
Of how we calmed the tides of war
We are your overlords

On we sweep with the threshing oar
Our only goal will be the western shore

So now you'd better stop and rebuild all your ruins
For peace and trust can win the day despite of all your losing

Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh

Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
